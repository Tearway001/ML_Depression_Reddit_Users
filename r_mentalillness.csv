t1a2r3e4s,Acting irrationally while on antidepressants,5,1c6cgr5,0,"Last year I was taking antidepressants (Lexapro) for anxiety and depression but it got to a point where I had to stop taking them as my parents said I started acting irrational and out of character. At the time I felt like I was just becoming more confident and happy. Now I am starting to become depressed again and am no longer confident, I also can’t hold a conversation with someone anymore, which was a skill I developed while on the medication. 

Anyway, I was just looking back at snapchat stories I posted last year and am having extreme second hand embarrassment at myself. Like I was WAYY TOO confident and would post things that I would NEVER post today. I literally used to spam my story with shit. The way I dressed was also so embarrassing as well as how I acted. I literally just need that whole part of my life erased from everyone’s memory cause I am so embarrassed. 

I am just posting this to see if anyone relates to acting different while on this sort of medication? I stopped taking the medication around July, however i continued being embarrassing even after I stopped the medication, maybe until around November, when I slowly realised I was being a weirdo. I am not sure if it was literally a manic episode that lasted months or something else.",1713366958.0,
Enough-Revolution682,Apparently I have schizophrenia,2,1c6egif,1,"So I was admitted to the hospital a year and a half ago and I was diagnosed with thought disorder. Then it officially turned into schizophrenia, anxiety and PTSD diagnosis. I already knew I had anxiety and PTSD but schizophrenia really doesn't fit me. I don't see or hear voices. I'm getting kinda angry cause the medication management team wants me to take medication and I am but the thing is I don't think I need it. My problems are to due to my traumatic past and not schizophrenia. If I heard voices and started seeing things I would understand but like I don't so wtf am I taking this medication for. Maybe they don't believe me or they don't give af. Anyways I hope in the next life I get to be the psychiatrist and their the patient lmao, no I'm just kidding but that's what it feels like.",1713371682.0,
nanana10x,Fake scenarios triggered by rejection or negative experiences with people,1,1c6h94k,0,"I have always created and daydreamed about fake scenarios, but I think I have found a pattern.

I realize when I experience rejection or experience external negative feelings, I internalize it afterwards and I start to imagine scenarios where that person is actually fond of me and that I was able to be useful to them in some way.

Today my manager told me to put my phone away, no big deal right. But it made me uncomfortable because it’s my second week so I feel like it will ruin her impression of me.

Suddenly I catch myself creating/ thinking about scenarios where this manager asks my colleagues about my performance and they tell her I’m doing really well. Or I start thinking of random scenarios of me being useful to her

I’m catching on that this might be a coping method for sure, but can it be an indicator of something else?

I do have a history of anxiety and depression, and I day dream a lot already.",1713378405.0,

RegularMinimum9424,I (19f) might fail this schoolyear due to depression. What do I do?,3,1c67zig,5,Normally I am good at school and do well. But I got a depressive period of time again that got really bad. I fell out of school for 3 months and I am trying to get back because if I dont I will fail. I have no energy and I feel absolutly terrible. It looks like I will fail so i want to die before that happens. But I dont want to make my parents sad. If I fail this school year my parents will find out i have been struggling because I am supposed to go to uni next year and move away. If i fail i will have to stay here. My psychologist thinks I am bipolar so she sent me somewhere to get diagnosed and treatment. But that is after the schoolyear is done so it is too late (even though it will probably make things easier at uni if i get in). Now I dont know what to do to get through the schoolyear. I try to do schoolwork and study but I get distacted by thought of killing myself and get stuck in thoughts about failure. I am doomed. What do i do?,1713355156.0,

I have been living with someone I suspect to have borderline personality disorder (neither she nor her psychiatrist has put a label on it, but she has intense mood swings over the smallest details, uncontrollable buying impulse, unstable relationship with everyone in the family, actually diagnosed major depression, and suicidal thoughts which I suspect are more parasuicidal if that makes sense), and I'm struggling to cope with the effects of her mood swings. Dealing with her feels like walking on a minefield.

happysadangryguilty,Need Advice,1,1c6ajfc,2,"For context I’m an 18 year old girl. After a few sessions and assessments with my psychiatrist and psychologist, he decided that I should be put on meds. I tested positive on CAARMS and FEP. Though I disagree with him, he has given me 0.25 Escitalopram (to be increased later) and 0.5 Risperidone. I do suffer from depression so I’m more open to Escitalopram. Also he hasn’t specified what I really ‘have’. I’m scared to try any of these meds though. I feel like I’m young. Plus I’m very scared of weight gain. I recently lost 60 pounds after a lot of hard work and cannot possibly do it again especially because I have exams. I’m hearing of terrible side effects here. What to do? I’m thinking of skipping Risperidone for a month (till after exams) atleast? I’m very lost. Everything is a mess now and I don’t understand what to do. My family doesn’t care, the two friends that I have told this to don’t care. 

If I start these meds, will I have to take them my whole life? If I don’t then will this feeling always stay with me? But taking it also has do many side effects?

Ok_Mind_3795,Missing school without my parents knowledge,3,1c639g5,1,"I'm currently a teenager and struggle with social anxiety and depression, and because of that, I've been missing a lot of school this year. The thing is, my parents don't know about me missing school most of the time, and when they see me at home, I'll just come up with an excuse. I feel bad for lying to them about this because they have high expectations, and them finding out about me missing out most of my school days would anger them since they don't see mental health as an excuse to miss school even if I'm struggling to stay alive. They do know that I go to therapy since I've told them a little about my social anxiety, but that's only about 20% of what I am going through. The worst part of it is that I might have to repeat this school year because of my bad attendance, and they still don't know about it. I also talked to my therapist about it, and she recommended inviting them to one of my therapy sessions and telling them my struggles, but I'm unsure. What do yall think?",1713336794.0,
MilkUdder22,My friend has lost their mind ,6,1c5vwvp,6,"I currently live in a house with 4 of my friends. One of them has gone down a dark path like nothing I could have ever believed. 

At the best of times they are shut away in their room only leaving to have a cigarette and or spliff. Completely quiet and isolated. 

At the worst of times they are erratic: talking to themselves, making loud banging noises or playing their guitar or listening to music at very loud volume. 

They have been taking ketamine and smoking weed daily as well as being on unprescribed medication. This medication is hormonal pills because they are simultaneously going through gender diaspora (born male now wants to be female) 

They have a traumatic past involving bullying, abuse and a drug addicted mother. 

It is almost impossible to talk to them because they have very little memory, what they are conveying does not make sense. 

Even in spite of this they are able to ‘put on a show’ if a family member comes to visit and refuse to go into rehab or a mental hospital. 

The nature of UK services means that despite all of this and the fact that we’ve said all of this to the NHS it is only the person in question who can make the call to go to get proper professional health. 

They are likely 4 grand in debt and heading towards either an overdose or homelessness. We currently have 2 months left of uni, they don’t realise/remember that they’ve been booted of their course. 

Their aren’t many chances left for them before they won’t have a guaranteed home at a uni house. 

Actual help is difficult here as we have tried the NHS to no avail. This has been going on for almost a year.

i cannot leave my current environment because i have no money and i can’t work becasue its really hard for me to even do normal things like breathe or drink water, getting out of bed to use the bathroom and all… i feel pathetic honestly….
i know the internet isn’t the best place what so ever to express oneself.. but i have no one face to face to talk to…. they won’t litsen to my side or even believe me. i know i can do nothing to change that….
my problem is… i look sad all the time and only ever really smile when it’s something i like is brought up or if im doing something i like or thinking about my favourite things.
i’m dissociating most if not all of the time…. but i feel like it’s an excuse and the folks i live with just tell me not to do it when it’s really out of my control…
and sometimes i like to get lost in my own imagination simply because environments are overstimulating and i just want to feel some sense of ease… this also feels like dissociation because i don’t feel like im in my body when i do that.. but i know that part isn’t dissociating.. i think.
if i explain any of this, they’ll never litsen to me… because they are set in their ways…
but when an ounce of this happened to them… i am there for them, or try to be… the best i could….
well… i’m not even sure if that’s true either.. i don’t know anymore….
i can’t feel it trust myself…
the thoughts won’t stop… i try to prevent these disasters… but it just happens anyway…
a waste of energy

this happens to anyone? if so.. please, any advise for what helpped?

Alternative-Rub6623,The mind of a sadist,0,1c64sph,1,"I rarely feel guilty, most of the time i feel that people deserve to be hurt (mentally). I.e, if someone hurts me, they deserve to get hurt the same way but worse if that makes sense. I feel some people can’t understand unless it’s done to them. I look at it as a game even. Like any time someone does something hurtful or disrespectful to me, i see it as them moving their chess piece. Then i’ll make my move and hurt them as well. Even if they do it unintentionally, or intentionally, I tend to think strategically about it; what can I do to make them feel the same pain as me, and waiting out enough time so that they forget what they did to me, therein, when I do it in return, it hurts worse for them because they don’t see the motive. If you pay back the pain too quickly, they may just see it as you doing it out of pettiness. 
    I haven’t always been this way though, I used to be very loving, very caring of every one and overly sensitive to every little thing. I got beat into this way. I had no choice but to turn out like this. It wasn’t planned but I was practically self taught, from experience that you can only care about yourself, and trust no one. Now with this mindset I get hurt a lot less. I may hurt others, but life was never fair to begin with. It is what it is quite literally.
     Do I want to stay like this? I’m not sure. I miss who I was sometimes, but when I think about it I was just a piece of gum stuck on the floor getting stepped on by everyone, until it was flattened. 
     Don’t think i’m some assh*le who is mean to everyone for no reason. No, i’m not an evil person, though i’m not good either. I just try to be fair in every way possible. Remember what they say, treat others the way you want to be treated. Or as I like to think, treat others how they treat you.

She gave one of my nieces up for adoption (she has 4 kids total 3 girls 1 boy) the other kids went with their Dad. My niece that she gave up for adoption was the product of a rape. So she did that & shortly after the other kids were sent with their Dad because she could no longer provide transportation for school. That was in September of last year. She started isolating & a few months went by & she didn’t show up for any holidays. I finally seen her in January & she had lost like 50lbs & looked super skeletal. & let me say shes never done drugs she doesn’t smoke anything, she only drinks wine with my Mom when she’s over. We weren’t speaking cause I was pissed about my niece so I got most of my information about her from my Mom. Ok she told my Mom that a celebrity stabbed her in the neck with a needle at a concert she went to. She said the Illuminati is after her. She stayed with my Mom for a few days & bounced around to different relatives cause she was scared to go home she said ppl were after her. While at my Moms she wrote prayers & lit them on fire. Made witch bottles & put them in my Moms refrigerator. My Mom walked in on her several times with pillows stacked on top of her head. I’m letting her stay with me until her new apartment is ready.

jeongtoot,extreme paranoia about family and feeling like i'm being watched,2,1c5x8bq,1,"all of this is going to sound really fucked up and its is extremely hard for me to talk about but i need to preface this by saying that my dad has NEVER done anything abusive towards me. i understand that a lot of this reads like i've been sexually abused or something as a child but i haven't. please don't say anything about subconscious trauma, bc i assure you it's not possible. i didn't even live with my dad for a large period of time as a child.  i also never felt like my dad looked at me inappropriately or thought about me in any way other than as a little kid. i've also never really had any mental health issues until this whole thing started. 

in december of 2022, during my final exams of that term, i'm not really sure why or what triggered it but i began experiencing a psychotic break. tbh im not even sure if thats what it was, but essentially, i began freaking out and accusing my dad of watching me through hidden cameras in my room and bathroom. we thought it was just the stress of my exams but these thoughts never went away even after the exams ended. in fact they got much worse as time went on. i began imagining my dad monitoring my texts with friends, listening into my phone calls and watching me through the camera of my phone and laptop. i started deluding myself that he could track my location because of the devices i always carry on me and that he could see me via cameras that were hidden in the cracks of my walls. the worst is the bathroom - i felt like he could watch me showering or using the bathroom. 

i don't have any reason for why he would ever WANT to do any of these things. prior to this, we had an absolutely normal father-daughter relationship and i had never imagined my dad being capable of any of this. it's just the awful, pervasive thought of ""what if he is, though?"". the feeling of being watched, made me slowly stop doing everything i enjoyed. it was absolutely debilitating. i couldn't reply to a text without wondering if my dad would be alerted of it and read my entire chat. i couldn't change my clothes without wondering if he could see me. i couldn't shower, and so i didn't. i would shower at late hours of the night when i was sure he was asleep. and even then i felt as though he could rewind the recording caught by the cameras in my bathroom and watch them later. i didn't shower for months at a time. when i thought back to all the times i had done things in private in my room and imagined my dad being able to see those things, i genuinely wanted to die. i felt disgusted even looking at myself in the mirror for a long time. it's not just the feeling of being watched that was bothering me. it was because it was my DAD that it felt disgusting. quite honestly i wouldn't give a single fuck if it was some random hacker watching me. as i did more research about hidden cameras and spyware/malware (ex. WebWatcher), i became more convinced because i realized all these things were actually possible. 

things started to get a little better when i moved out of my family house. my parents were able to see how much i was suffering and i convinced them that this was the only way i could begin to move on. instead of getting rid of the thoughts of my dad monitoring me, i've just sorta learned to function/cohabitate with them. i started normalizing the fact that i would change my clothes in the dark corner of my closet as quickly as i humanly could. that i instinctively cover my phone camera and audio receiver when i'm chatting with friends. i still only shower like once a week bc i can't put myself through more than that. i can enjoy the things i used to enjoy but i still feel as though my dad can watch me in my apartment and through the cameras of my devices. i call my parents every night to say goodnight, but everytime i'm talking to my dad, i look too far into what he says as evidence of my delusions. he could say something like ""we bought new x for the bathroom shower"" and it'll keep me up for hours wondering how he knew i had showered that day and if it was his way of taunting me that he knew. sometimes i'll test him and say i'm at home when i'm really not, just to gauge his response. while i do constantly test him, i'm also terrified that he'll say something to confirm my fears, because i don't have a game plan for what to do if any of this is actually true. i can't invite friends over to my place or spend the night at anyone else's because the whole time i feel like he can listen in. i can't imagine even texting or dating someone new, i don't think i'll even be able to get married or have a normal sexual relationship if this continues. i'm not on medication but i did see a psychiatrist who had me take a small dose of olanzapine and I also went to a few therapy sessions but ultimately nothing worked or made these thoughts permanently go away. i feel like i'm going to be stuck in this awful mindset until either i die or my dad does - which is a horrible, fucked up thing to say, i know - but thats how it feels. 

for some background info, i've actually always been very close with my dad and before all this, i would've trusted him with my life. i still would, because other than for this matter he's still the first person i go to when i need something. i'm an only child and i've lived with my dad since i was 14, he basically raised me as a single parent bc my mom was stuck in another country due to immigration issues. tbh i think the reason all of this bothers me to the extent it does is because of how much i trust him, because this would be the utmost betrayal of my trust and love for him. he's always done a lot for me and the fact that i'm having these awful twisted delusions and he's at the centre of them makes me feel so much guilt and disgust that i genuinely hate myself. i know he adores me and the fact that i'm causing a rift in our relationship because of my mental illness is killing me.

 I don’t understand how to play fight. I can only ever take it seriously. And I always take it too far which makes people mad at me.

I’ve always kept the saying “if everyone around you is the problem, you’re the problem” very close to heart and have held hate in my heart for anyone who told me “it’s not you it’s them”
I have these same problems over and over again where I’m like getting fussed at for my reactions mainly and of course other things that I bring up excuses to like my pain or whatnot. Whatever the conclusion is that my way of thinking my reasoning whatever is wrong and I’m not taking responsibility for the things I do wrong I’m just making up excuses.
1 how do I stop being in denial and accept this so I can make changes 
2 how can I find out if I’m a narcissist (in the meantime do research to bring to a therapist as I just got Medicaid again and have a whole store list of things I need to work on

New_Zebra_8403,is something wrong with me? ,1,1c5ndvi,1,"in the outside, i look normal apart from being extremely quiet, humourless and non witty. Tbh, I don't what people think of me. but they must either think that I'm just quiet, or think I'm really weird (so far no one has openly said) I interact rarely anyways. Or the third category where they're just confused and feel like I'm off. I think I know couple of people like that. 

Truth is, I am weird. Not in a quirky sense. But my mind. As a child, I don't remember playing that much or having too many memories. Before 7 years if age, I barely remember anything. And after that, the memories are just clumped together as one feeling/vibes. 7-8 I remember being timid, but peaceful. I had bo pressure to fit in and to be myself, basically had one friend. Don't remember taking too much to her. But she was there for company.  The timidness was still there and continued to grow after 9. But all people saw was my quietness. I had friends whom I didn't want to be with, cause I didn't connect with them truly, in fact, I don't know what I was about. I don't know what I'd expect to do or who I'd want to be friends with. All i know was, I'd rather be silent than feel the pressure to laugh at jokes. And fit in. I had the people pleasing syndrome. Unfortunately. So I couldn't express myself and tell that I want to be alone. I'd never disagree and always smiling. This never went away and continued through high school. I became known as the smiling girl. Never got to experience real joy. I wouldn't call everyday bad, but it wasn't good, either. It was like A game, and of I kinda dislike going to school. I'd dread Mondays and school after vacation. So, who was i other than school times, was I comfortable at home? Comfortable, I guess. Enough to be silent and myself. But not enough to tell them the fact about how I felt at school. Even at home, I was very restraint. And later on I concluded, i must've born that way. Idk. I was sort of close woth my sister. We shared the same honor. Both were awkward and played together occasionally. Still we weren't like normal siblings fighting nor was I super super attached to her. My interests then we making videos, dressing up. Still I like them. But I spent  great deal of time doing nothing at home. I watched TV. So maybe I didn't feel enogh boredom to try new things? Even when I did, still I wouldn't do anything. My mind was empty most the time. 

Around high school, I started to get insecure about my personality. Saw how different I was. Couldn't talk normally, joke normally. But I could study and get fine grades. And because of my general silence my family didn't see any issues with me. Everything is in my head. 

I can think but I don't like thinking or interpretating stuff. So there goes my critical thinking skills. I don't have a wild imagination. I dont read because I cannot picture and it becomes annoying. My vocabulary is very limited and I can't come with quick or new responses. My brain becomes foggy.  What do I think, say, when I have nothing to do, at night etc? I think of things I have done most recently. Things I've looked up. It's always the same circle. Thinking about my identity. Thinking about life. how to live.  What to do.  Oh. I have decision paralysis too. Therefore end up doing nothing sometimes.I have little to no emotions. Little empathy, cold and unfeeling. But as I mature, I see the need to be good no matter how I feel. So I try to oppose that side of me. 

Currently, not a person who's close to me. One because I'm shy. Two because I myself don't know who I am and am so boring I wouldn't know how to contribute to a friendship. Before being alone was an ideal. For example the lock down was everything to me. But now with little outings and minimal non deep interactions I feel a bit hollow. 

What could be the possible explanations for this?  Do you think I've any developmental issues? Or personality disorders? Possibly cluster B personality disorders? ",1713291939.0,

 Edit: I did my best to split it up into paragraphs for easier read as suggested by a commenter. I hope this helps!
   
    Before telling the story I'd like to say my Dad was physically there but he was(possibly still is) on drugs, is a narcissistic liar, verbally and mentally abusive, and has SAd other family members, possibly has done it to me as a child. My mom was physically there and tried her best to be emotionally there but was so checked out with her own super toxic/failing relationship, numbing everything with alcohol and weed, and trying to take care of 3 kids of her bf that she wasn't much help until later on/getting sober.
       
    So at the young age of 12 I started talking to and seeking a father figure online. When I was 14 I met a 32 year old man in my state I felt I connected with, we'll call him J. J lived about 6 hours driving from me. J and I were talking for months, he acted like a father at first and made sure I was doing my homework, praised me, told me I was a cute sweet girl, etc. he put in all the works on me and even sent me some gifts via mail. I fell HARD. After a while of talking we both admitted being attracted to each other then J introduced me into BDSM & DDLG. Now I had heard of those things before but only really saw it in scripted porn. I didn't really know too much about it but I liked the idea of him being my Daddy and sorta boyfriend at the same time.
    
       We had a relationship online with him giving me things/tasks to do for him (obviously sexual stuff)and send pics+vids of me doing it to him. J also had a girlfriend for some time while we chatted and would email be pictures and videos of them being intimate without her Knowledge. J would praise me for ""being Daddy's good girl"" and I ate it right up. J talked about wanting to meet me in person, told me we had a special connection, he's never felt this way, said how much he liked me, he made me feel so special and loved. After like 4-6months of online relations and sending me gifts he brought up using the family business to take a trip up to the city I lived in to do some work there(the real reason was to come see and meet me). I knew going into it we would have psychical relations and was super excited to meet him and ""have some fun"" as he said. 
        
         When the time cameI tried to lie to my Dad saying I was going to hang out with a friend for the weekend, I told him her dad would pick me up and drop me back off, my real plan was to stay at the hotel over the weekend with J. J had already gotten in the plane before I could message him to say nevermind don't come and that my dad is super suspicious and told me he can take me to my friends. I even tried to convince my Dad ""we already made the plans it's fine"" but he wasn't budging, his dad Spidey senses were tingling HARD. I'm a bit surprised he even noticed I was up to something/cared because he was a horrible father. 

          I messaged J and told him we can't do this because my dad was getting suspicious. J lost his ever loving mind on me, he went completely off the rails, cussed me out, said I ruined everything, I was a terrible person, how dare I waste him precious time like this, the trip was a complete waste, etc. I was crying my eyes out, profusely apologizing, trying to come up with some way to make things right and make him happy and show me love again. We went back of fourth with him just being a complete Dick to me while I was locked in my room having a panic attack. I told J I'll give him some space to calm down and message me when he's not so upset, we talked later that night and agreed to meet up during the day while my dad was busy. 

          Mid afternoon he picked me up a couple blocks from my house and drove us down to a empty church parking lot to chat. We ended up kissing and touching each other, and gave him oral. He dropped me off where he picked me up and I walked home. My dad asked where I had gone when I came home and I told him I just went on a walk to get some air. He knew something was up but didn't say anything. I chatted with J online and he told me how exciting our encounter was, he confessed how hot it was, and said he wanted to rip me out of the car and penetrate me against a church wall. We made plans to meet up after everyone in my house fell asleep.

           Around 3 am I decided it was safe so I snuck out to meet up with him, he picked me up in the same spot, we went back to the same church parking lot, and got into the back of his car to be closer together. This time around he was a completely different person though, we kissed and felt each other and stuff, then I gave him some oral, he asked me to bend over his lap and started using his fingers on me, then something snapped in him. He was taking my hair so hard some fell out, punch and spanking me so hard I was crying tears, he choked me hard enough I could get any air in, he then attempted to put his entire fist inside me, while this was going down I was crying tears and screaming out in pain. He yelled ""SHUT THE FUCK UP *insert my name*"" i got super quiet and silently cried bent ober his lap taking it. I'm not sure how long this lasted but it felt like a good 30 minutes, he then pushed me off of him and I hit the car door, he ripped his pants on and was rock, grabbed a handful of my hair and yanked me down using my face like a blow up sex doll until he finshed, I swallowed it and was silent. I stayed in the back seat while he drove me back to our designated pick up/drop off zone, all he said was goodbye then drove off.

           After that we didn't talk for a couple weeks, then would periodically talk on and off over the months, but he was nothing like before and ignored me most of the time. A couple months later my best friend, mom, and I watched 50 shades of gray and I was a emotional wreck balling my eyes out through the movie. She had somehow found out who Jeff was and that we talked online but never knew the extent of what happened. She was worried and asked me if something had happened and why thisovie was making me cry. I just shut down completely and said I don't know but I don't want to finish the movie. After this incident I held everything in for a year until I was 15&1/2 + half way through my freshman year in highschool.

           I was always really depressed and never the same after that night but didn't tell anyone, one night I was in my mom's bed and felt completely defeated. I opened up and told her EVERYTHING. I had a complete melt down and she cried with me too. She said we have to tell the police, the next day they came and questioned me very thoroughly on everything that happened, I gave them physical evidence ( the gifts and sex toys he mailed me), I didn't have any digital evidence unfortunately. 

          Time goes by they do the investigation and eventually we have a court date, on that day I got up in front of everyone and shakily gave my impact statement while crying in front of the judge and audience of people who were there for other cases. He stood there facing away, looking at the wall, and shaking his head no the entire time. I wish I had asked the judge to make him face me and the audience at the time but was just so upset and emotional. He ended up taking a plea bargin, I agreed in fear of fighting it and not having enough evidence, and him getting off scott free. This MF was sentanced to 3 months in county jail, only served 2&1/2 months. Meanwhile I'm serving a life time of trauma, PTSD, depression, disassociation episodes, nightmares, fearing all men, and even questioning my gender(thinking if I was a boy this wouldn't have happend). I even saw people who looked like him in public a couple times and had a complete melt down/panic attack.

           Around 18 I found out that he was again charged in court, but this time it was for, picking up and harboring a runaway from a group home, holding her captive, shooting her up with hard drugs, beating and raping her as well as taking photos and videos of it all. So let's get to the reason I'm telling this in the first place. After numbly going through the entire process in complete brain fog and disassociation I've had a lot of time to think about everything. 

          I'm 23 now and am/ have for a couple years been struggling with thoughts of I was wrong to report this, it's my fault this happened, I wanted and asked for this, and knew what was coming, etc. So my questions to you is: Do you think I was wrong to tell the police what happened? & Do you think this is my fault? Please explain why. If you've come this far I'd like to thank you for making it through this insanely long winded and disgusting post, I hope this made you think or brought some sort of insight to you on pedophilia and how it affects the victims of it. I'm sorry if there are Grammer or spelling mistakes, it took a lot in me just to think about and type this out, I can't go back and make sure everything is perfect. I hope y'all understand.

TheDrunkCaptain,Feeling suicidal,0,1c5f6qc,5,"Hi.

Don't really know how to begin this type of text but I will give it a shot. 

Disclaimer: i know how badly i fucked up and that I need help. You're 100 % allowed to shit on me.

I guess i just dont know how to talk to professionals and it scares me that's why i havent tried.

I've been feeling suicidal ideations the last couple of months. It started five months ago when I was out drinking with a friend. 

We went to a party with people he knew ( alot of druggies.)
My friend has always had issues with drugs. I've tried some before but didnt enjoy it so I was always

For some reason i wanted to fit in so I also took the drugs they were taking. It was the most primal rush i've ever had and it made completely rabid.

I sat down In the sofa and there was a woman there (also on drugs like the rest). She leaned on me and for some reason i just started to grab her. She said no and I stopped and apologized. 

Ofc this sparked some reactions from the people at the party but they let it go rather quickly. Eventually i started to get more and more neurotic about this as time was passing cause I realized what an asshat i was to my fiancée and the woman. 

I left the party when I felt like enough was enough (i wasnt feeling good anyways so why stay). Walking home i had delusions that I was gonna get completely canceled and lose everything. I thought the people at the party were gonna let everyone in my life know and make me lose my job etc.

I went home to my fiancee and told her everything and that I wanted to kill myself (i thought it was the only way out of this nightmare at that point, cause i thought i was about to get canceled). My fiancée called my friend and asked what the substance was. My friend told me that the cancel thing was delusions.

The day after was probably my worst day ever. My mental health has been bad but i've never felt like this. I managed to make her feel like shit and also make another woman feel unsafe. 

Ofc it wasnt easy for my fiancée to accept (it still isnt for me). She loves me and she forgave me after time and work. I love her so much and I dont deserve her for this but I made sure to try to become a better person. 

I feel guilt for both the betrayal of my fiancée and also the fact that I made the woman feel unsafe. Its not something i wanted...

Fast forward abit : it took alot of work to even become slightly happy again. Im still stuck in december and it doesent feel real. I did everything i could including reading books,, working out and eating healthy.

Recently i was starting to feel better again after a long time.

However.

My friend still calls me but I can feel a difference in our friendship and he also makes passive aggressive comments. Today i also learned that he told our mutual friends since one of them joked about it. Which hurts me alot.

I did so much work the past months to get out of the trench and know i feel like im back since he's telling people in my life about it. 

I dont know how to deal with this. I get that many people will hate on me for this but I honestly dont know what to do.",1713271482.0,

Ratinyourwall,Mental health and concerns for my future,1,1c5dwd7,1,"I have struggled with Depression, Anxiety, and ADHD for about 7 years. All of which have made life very difficult for me. I’m embarrassed to say this but it prevents me from doing many normal daily tasks. I brush my teeth once every few days, only shower once every 1-2 weeks, cannot cook food for myself, if food is cooked for me I often don’t even have the energy to eat it, when I need to go to the toilet I will sit for hours until I actually go, leaving me incredibly uncomfortable, I don’t go out and socialise with friends, at times I can’t even dress myself and my boyfriend has to help me, and I am very tired and negative all the time. I suffer with SH and due to my eating habits I am underweight. I will admit that I have thought about suicide on and off for many years, making detailed plans on a number of occassions, although my uncle killed himself and the guilt of making my dad go through that again is too much. I am also afraid that it wouldn’t work and people were disappointed in me or I ended up physically disabled. I’m being open in the hopes that it will help other people not feel so misunderstood and alone, and so that others in my situation can use this post to help themselves.
I have switched around medications, all of which seem to provide minimal help, I’ve had therapy (of different sorts) and been to A&E when things have gotten too bad. 

I am 17, in the UK,  and dropped out of college during my second year. Originally I planned to go back, to retry the next year, but as the time is getting closer I am realising that I don’t think I will be capable of it. I want to be able to make my own income and be independent, but as of right now being in college just won’t work for me. People have said that I should believe in myself, but in school, and college, I did this and it has never worked out for me. I know myself better than anyone else does, and if I’m being realistic I know that it just isn’t for me. 

I live alone with my mum, and she will be supportive of any decisions I make. As of right now I need advice or possible options for me in the future.

Maybe jobs, ways I can work my way through life, ways of income, education etc. Any advice would be brilliant as I am at a loss right now. I feel like there are no routes I can go down, and my future is feeling very nonexistent. I find that I am very bad with repitition, if I do something the same time every month it begins to become very difficult and I cannot gather motivation to do it. Though I feel like almost all jobs will be repetitive. 

I’m not trying to live an extravagant lifestyle, as I know that is just something I won’t be able to do, but I just need enough to make it by.

Admirable-Channel-44,Venting post ig lol ,2,1c52ovo,0,"I’m 18 m, growing up I always felt different and out of touch with others, as if my life was like a movie and Im just stuck watching it, I’ve hated my body as far back as I can remember, I feel like me and my body are two completely different beings, but I know I’m not trans or anything like that, I like being a boy I want to be a boy and I enjoy being a boy, but I’m not and never was like all the boys I know/knew. Growing up this way felt incredibly isolating and shameful, this only led to more and more self hatred. I started self harming at 11 years old and it’s continued up until now I still struggle with it. I’ve also struggled with suicidal ideation since 8-9 years old, I have always felt like my very existence is a disappointment to my family, my friends, my teachers etc. I feel so stuck in this mind of mine, I can’t go a single day without thinking how much of a disgusting disfigured mess I am, honestly I feel so behind compared to others my age, people are out dating and going to school while I have never dated anyone due to my insane insecurities and I have chosen a career that is looked down upon and makes me feel like a disappointment to people (even tho it’s tho only thing that I find genuine interest in) I could never picture myself in the future and I still can’t I’m too busy struggling my way through each day barely keeping myself alive anymore, i struggle with taking care of my hygiene, I barely sleep at all, I have a horrible relationship with food due to me starving myself to lose weight (it kinda worked ig I lost 50-60 lbs) growing up I’ve always told myself I’d never actually commit but I’m terrified to live the rest of my life this way and idk how much longer I can do it, my body is in genuine pain all the time I almost feel like I’m alr dead, nothing feels real anymore.

Ok-Pianist-9729,HELP!!!  I dont know what to do!!!,2,1c52lf6,4,"I am a female who is 19. I feel so out of options. I've tried every stimulant and currently I'm on adderall and it doesn't work at all. I feel tired and weak and get angry quickly. I start shaking and feel nauseous. 

Adderall used to work when I was younger. It doesn't anymore.

In general without medication I feel so hungry and tired all the time. With medication it makes it worse.  I can't get regular sleep without continuously waking up everyday. I've been feeling so hungry over the past few years. When i complain they test me and my labs come back normal so they just shrug. I'm sorry tried of living. Everyday is so miserable. 

Without my meds I lose everything, get mad, I can't function, I can barely take care of myself. With my meds I feel sick and miserable too.
  I am on duloxetine because it's the only med that doesn't apparently cause weight gain. It kind of works. 

I gained a bunch of weight after starting the depo shot a few years ago because my cramps were debilitating and i would throw up and be unable to walk, and my period is very heavy so i tried to opt out of that experience. 50 pounds later i hate myself so much and i still feel so hungry every day. I have switched to using patches continuously to skip my period but the best part is when i take my adderall i start BREAKTHROUGH BLEEDING and severely cramping. how am i supposed to win???? 

Then the stupid ass doctors just tell me to take ibuprofen, which i can't because it doesn't work as well anymore, and it interacts with duloxetine and Tylenol is just about as useful as my PINKY TOE.


 I've tried so many diets, calorie counting, drinking water, i wake up in the middle of the night hungry. I could eat until I'm so full i can't move but i would STILL BE HUNGRY. Doctors don't know what's wrong with me and don't know why my adderall doesn't work. My A1C and glucose is perfect.

It's gotten to the point where I pretty regularly cry about being hungry no matter how little or how much i eat, and I'm even STARVING ON ADDERALL.

I have been trying so many different doses of fucking every stimulant And i would literally go home from school and work crying and i have been crying in the bathrooms lately. I want my body back and my life and my money i spend it all on food and I struggle in school and work and i just want to function like a normal person.
I get angry doing school work and cry daily so I have just not been showing up, and I have been calling out of work too. I DONT KNOW HOW TO GET A DOCTOR TO TAKE ME SERIOUSLY!!! please help please help I'm so MISERABLE.  

I don't know how to fix myself and be my former self again. I wish i never FUCKING TOOK THE FIRST FUXKING SHOT. I'm literally in tears as I'm reading this right now and yes i SO FUCKING HUNGRY. 
And no, i cannot afford therapy.

In conclusion, I cannot function or sleep or study or work and i am constantly hungry and i have ran out of options. I even tried to hypnotize myself. (this isn't a troll post i am so serious)

I_Love_Cyndaquil2,I think I'm all good now.,5,1c4smxp,0,"Nine years, nine years of really suffering from BPD, ADHD, and CPTSD. Nine years of nightmares that made the doctor at the hospital stare at me dumbfounded when I told them about. Nine years of hallucinating, nine years of crying my self to sleep, and nine years of blaming myself for being like this.

And three months, of being better.

I'll start from the top. I was in class, and failing a math test, the one test I needed in order to pass that class. So I lifted my fist, and slammed it into my head until I was concussed. After this I got put on online school, as I was deemed unsafe to have around.

Then when I recovered from my concussion, there was this girl. I won't say her name, but long story short, she was my favourite person, and I treated her like shit. I talked with her, and found out I didn't hurt her. That was the start of my recovery, I thought I failed her, I thought I hurt someone who was only trying to help me, but in reality I didn't hurt her, and that was all I needed to know. I thought I wanted to be her friend, I thought I loved her, but in reality I felt bad, and I cared for her.



I started listening to music, really listening to it. I found punk rock, and fucking love it. Then I started playing recorder, which taught me to work for things to get better.

I then bought myself a jean jacket, which I adorned with patches and pins. Then I got a fauxhawk. This combination challenged my social anxiety, by making me stand out, when for nine years I tried to fit in.

After this I got a job working at a thrift store. On my first day I was already working in the warehouse, cleaning, helping customers, and organizing shelves. On my second day we had a 50% off everything in the store, and I had to do double the work, which I did flawlessly. Here I had to work with crackheads at my sixteen years old, and I managed to actually help and calm down most of them. At this I realized that I wasn't lazy, and stupid like my family and teachers said, I was a hard worker, and helpful.

I quit working there.

Then I started watching movies. I watched 300, spaceman with Adam Sandler, Click, and Liar Liar. 300 taught me power, friendship, and sacrifice. Spaceman was the first drama I ever cried too, and paired with click, and liar liar, these movies taught me to stop taking everything for granted.

Every morning I began to wake up and acknowledge how lucky I am to wake up in a soft bed, be able to make myself breakfast, play video games, and type out what I am writing now.

Then I started watching horror movies, and trying to put myself in the characters shoes, to try and build empathy.

Then I started running, I started by being able to run down the street, and soon I could run an entire block. With this I started losing weight, and now my skin-tight pants from last semester are baggy.

Then I started meditating, I began to meditate on manifesting, and this is a bit spiritual, but what I'm trying to get is becoming clearer. Then I started following my intuition, I stopped relying on external deities', tarot cards, coins, horoscopes, gems, or anything. I started to rely on myself.

Then, I realized I started smoking weed. I used it to not to party, but for medical and spiritual purposes. When I was high, I would meditate, using this I could lucid dream. Then, the next day I would crash, and in would come psychosis. But this time I didn't face it with fear, I acknowledged the thought, I wrote it down, and thought of where it could have come from, and then, I let it go. Now I can identify the difference between psychosis and me.

And lastly, I stopped striving for perfection. I stopped trying to make myself better, I am flawed, but so is everyone else. I am no God, I am no man, I am merely a spec of dust standing on a rock that's floating through space, the last thing I need to be is perfect.

And that's where I am now, and honestly, I'm content with this. I may never reach my goals, and I may never become the person, or live the life I always dreamed of, but that will be fine too. Where I am now, I am perfectly content to live.

My favourite quote used to be by Tim McIlrath, ""It's not the end that I fear with each breath, it's life that scares me to death."" But now, I don't think I have a favourite quote, and that's fine with me.

I'm not saying in this post that I have achieved all I want, or that I am perfect now. But compared to who I was, I'm doing pretty fucking good. And now, I think for the first time in forever, I can say with confidence, and without a shred of fear in me, that I am ready for the future.

For the first time in nine years, I am able to say that I have not talked negatively about myself, others, or have self harmed. And right now, I'm getting better everyday.

Anyways, that's all for now. Thank you to everyone who has helped me over the years.",1713203577.0,
TheBoringBitch,I feel like I have an eating disorder but I’m fat,21,1c4huae,19,"So it all started when I was in 7th grade, I started to notice that I was bigger than the other girls. I started to write in my journal that I was fat and I should stop eating. My dad at the time was saying things like “I’m so fat”, “ugh I’m so big”, and “look at how big my stomach is”. And he would say it in front of me. 

I have similarities with my dad’s body. For example, I have my dad’s legs as they are big. So I was thinking like “oh my body is similar to my dads so I’m fat too” 

I started to count my calories and would try and limit to 500cals a day. I would write down what I ate and how many calories it was. I would track how many calories I burned too. I would put pictures of the body I wanted in my journal. I would also go on pro Ana sites and read all of the tips on there. 

I barely lost any weight tbh as I failed and ate like a pig when I got home from school. I lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks from dancing for like 3 hours everyday. 

During the summer, I didn’t do any diets or counting calories because I either forgot or I just didn’t care? Idk I forget. But I was still conscious of my weight. I remember seeing my sister look at my stomach when I was wearing a bikini and trying not to laugh in front of me. 

When school rolls around, so does the calorie counting again. I barely lost any weight again as it’s the same thing from last year. But I also started to chew and spit. 

Summer was the same as last summer.

9th grade. I started to chew and spit my food but I would binge when I got home. I gained a lot of weight over the summer and I lost some of it but not a lot. 

10th grade. I didn’t really chew and spit anymore and I wasn’t counting calories. I gained more weight. 

Skip to now. I am in college and I’m really struggling but I’m fat. I’m 170lbs and 5’7. I have starved for like 3 months and I lost 20 pounds. 

My thoughts about food are just awful. I hate food. But I love it at the same time. I want to eat all the time. I want to eat everything in sight and then just purge it out. But I can’t. I’m scared of throwing up. Like I get panic attacks when someone throws up or if I throw up. But I’m getting to the point that like I don’t care about me being scared of throwing up. Like at this point I kinda want to throw it up you know? Like I dream of being able to just throw it all up. My mind is not right, i know it is. I think I can’t have an eating disorder because im fat.

I have tendencies to fake my own emotions and thoughts, especially towards others. 
(ex. - i could be literally dating someone and actually act like i have a crush on them - like hug them, flirt/flatter them, but then i end up being distant and pull away before leaving them. kind of sounds like love bombing... and in the end, all i can think is just criticise everything about them, especially if they're mentally weak and convince myself it was all ""an act for the show"")

But i hold myself back from doing it, or at least try to. I don't know why i think or do these things, it's not as bad as others really.

I can give so many disorders as an excuse, but I can’t forgive myself for it. And even then, I’m going to keep doing it, because I don’t want to change. Changing is hard, uncomfortable and unlinear.

RosePetalsAnd_Thorns,workaholic parents + Burnout,3,1c4ee6m,0,"Does anyone else suffer from a dysfunctional family that centers around money, working alot and forced toxic positivey about doing stuff everyday to ""improve your life""?

He doesn't understand my autism and had made no attempts to see the struggles it causes. Especially for burnout and exacerbating ocd flares

I know on the surface it's a good thing but in practice it becomes draining and depressing. My Dad used to drink and smoke alot but now never does drinking nor smoking. He may have the casual beer after a hard day of work but it's only one.

Now he spends his free time watching ""self improvement"" videos with people like Jocko Willinks and Tony Robbins and James Clear (Atomic Habits). Holding what they say is true due to hearing it from other successful people who made alot of money. He Believes in self discipline and ""happiness is in the mind"" type mindsets. He told me today to ""get out of my comfort zone"" and push yourself because ""I'm not even trying"".

For a while I did so too. I pushed myself alot trying to get a degree in computer science and then working full time in retail during summer breaks. But the anger and mental torment I got from pushing myself wore me down. Plus I had a streak of bad luck with prof teachers and was constantly stressed about passing 24/7. Ontop of that I had lazy roommates who were passive aggressive and touched my stuff while I was gone. I knew I should have said something bug I felt like there would be tension and I had enough of it.

Chronically anxious made me depress and it caused me severe burnout. I felt drained and dragging my feet trying to finish classes. I was mad and pissed off at the unfair circumstances I was in.

The work I did at the moment made no impact because now I have moved back in with my Dad who is a severe workaholic and is Disappointed by my lack of effort to even get out of bed at a reasonable time. I wake up so sad and I feel like he never understands why I'm so pessimistic.

I live in Canada where the economy is in shambles and buying a house seems like a ""pie I the sky"" sort of deal. I want to have goals but the OCD and depression make each day a drain as I wake up and do stuff then immediately feel like sleeping again.

I have a psychiatrist but they don't understand ocd and just hope the pills will work. I'm on 100 mg of zoloft, 50mg of regular seroquel in the day, 100mg of seroquel xr at night and 1mg of klonopin daily.

I try to help my Dad but then he always ""moves the goal post"" and gives criticism to my flaws then acknowledging all the work I do for him. Like yesterday I helped him out in the yard for 4 hours. But today I had to do homework so he complains I didn't help him at all today and ignores yesterday. Never grateful for what I do to help him.

He yells alot and ""tells me to fuck off"" which he says he doesn't mean it after. But it hurts when he yells and keeps going off. I even don't like bringing stuff up as he goes on and on about stuff. Good or bad. He just talks my ear off. If I don't do what he says and give him reasons he sees them as excuse and yells at me. Even him saying he's ""talking nicely"" is condensing and is out to judge me and make me feel guilty.

Just tonight I asked if I could quickly brush my teeth and he told me to ""fuck off"" because I was using up his time. He has only an hour of free time before going to bed and can't waste five minutes to let me brush my teeth as I get too tires after watching the show. So he yells and makes me feel bad. He doesn't even stay up the whole time we were watching the show so that's annoying.

I try to love him but his working attitude is insane. He goes to bed at 12am and wakes uo around 4am to either go to work which is an hour drive there and an hour drive back. Or he's doing paperwork. He complains that he hates it but ""life is 80 percent bullshit and 20 percent fun"". Which makes me even more pessimistic. I feel tired just listening to him about it. Even other topics as he goes on and on talking. Just doesn't know when to shut up.

My mom is not better. If I miss a day of my retail job due to ocd flare she tells me to ""suck it up and go to work"". She's a whole new can of worms but both have done their part to ruin my development.

Anyways that's my rant. Does anyone have similar parents? What have you done in terms of burnout and ocd? I take supplements Like Ashwagandha, L-theanine, gaba, magnesium bisglycinate, and 5-http.

I have read a bit of atomic habits and the daily stoic 366 meditations by Ryan Holiday. Please any advice would be helpful. Thanks and have a good day

tranzgenderz,How deeply am i supposed to feel things?,6,1c45bbv,3,"Vulnerable post but I'm at a loss. I won't be graphic but proceed with caution as I'm speaking about generally heavier topics. This is a long post [sorry] but I would appreciate some advice/answers if anyone can even just skim through to get the gist. 

For context I (19M) am diagnosed with ASD, DID, C-PTSD (amoung other things), and actively in therapy for it. I am also 99% sure I have StPD, and plan on suggesting the possibility to my therapist sometime. I also have gotten a Bipolar1, OCD, panic disorder, social anxiety, psychotic depression, and ADHD diagnosis as well as a possible BPD one in the past but I don't feel as if I really meet any of the criteria of those disorders, and the symptoms I do have of each could likely be better explained by StPD. [I'm also curious about the possibility of NPD but not overly concerned with looking into it, I definitely have narcissistic traits but that may just be attributed to paranoia and trauma-related beliefs.] Started therapy for auditory and visual hallucinations, severe depression, and SI when I was 11, was prescribed Prozac and Risperidone, was manic for 2-3 months (impulsive, extremely irritable and emotional all the time, got 0-5 hours of sleep a night, increased psychotic symptoms, increased SI and self-harm, etc), was taken off of Prozac but continued Risperidone until I was 15 or so. Been on over 20 mental health medications of all different types (currently unmedicated), seen 5 therapists, 3 psychiatrists, and 5 psychiatric hospitalizations. 

So, some pretty intense issues going on in my head all the time. It's brutal in here, man. I know that the DID, CPTSD, and general severe mental illness through childhood and adolescence can contribute to feeling as if one doesn't have a proper identity or sense of self. StPD also appears to have ipsiety-disturbances (I struggle a bit to understand the literature about it though), and generally struggling with having any sense of self. I often view myself as non-human, like I live in this (sub)reality as a human, but I truly am something else in spirit and soul. Maybe an angel of sorts, or a mass of energy that can't be defined or understood in human times. I often feel as if my sense of self and identity is incomprehensible.

This all makes me struggle a lot with ""feeling"" things truly. I definitely have emotions, but I only feel as if they're manifesting in my physical form, like I feel them in my body and the ""shell"" around my brain (which determines how I act in the reality I physically exist in with everyone else). But at my ""core,"" I don't feel them. It's hard when I feel as if I can never experience anything in any genuine, life-changing ways. Love, happiness, gratitude, curiosity, sadness, anxiety, et cetera; they're all such foreign concepts to me. The only thing I really think I can truly feel is anger, but even then it's rarely ""life-changing"" and I only feel it in short, but intense, bursts.

This also makes me feel incredibly disconnected from my symptoms, leading to a lot of self-doubt at times. My outer self, this idea of a ""shell,"" feels a lot of these things and often just lives with them, but it rarely reaches my core. I get extremely anxious or depressed, and on one level I feel it, but on the other I equally feel absolutely nothing at all. Sometimes my brain registers that I'm hearing or seeing something that I know isn't there, but my sense of sight and hearing doesn't actually pick it up. My physical self experiences delusional thinking but my core self knows it's just my truth. Everything I experience is equally real and not real. I experienced severe trauma (most of which I don't remember due to the DID, as well as other factors such as young age and intoxication) and it impacts how I think and act on the outside, but at my core there's nothing there. I feel like I never actually experienced that, I feel like I never actually experienced any part of my life. None of it feels like ""mine."" My alters, I can communicate with and I feel our barriers within my physical body, but at my core none of us actually exist.

I just feel like a ghost or something. I feel really hopeless. There's so many truths I believe in that I know aren't true, but I also know they are. Every single thing I believe and feel is like a paradox, I'm living a multitude of lives with all the combinations my brain makes of things that are real and are fake. I can't even find the words for it. I've mentioned this all to my therapist but she can't quite answer it.

I've noticed throughout my life I can see and even sometimes feel any side to any argument. If someone presents me with a belief completely contrary to my beliefs, including my own strongly held moral values, I will understand it even to the point I may doubt myself. At times this is helpful bc I argue things out in my head and feel good if I can cling to my original stance despite trying to sway myself. On the other hand,it's dangerous bc if I allign with people (perhaps politically) who start saying things that offend me (like due to my social class), I can be lured to another group of people who seem more accepting of me. 
At times I guess my thinking is black and white. As a child/teen in particular, I saw all politicians as bad (even though I aligned with a political party), had a universal distrust of lawyers (and actually quite a few professions) and thought certain celebrities were simply ""bad people"". As an adult, I feel I see a lot of nuances and generally don't classify groups of people or individuals as simply ""bad"". Unless someone does something negative to me. If someone does something that makes me feel disrespected, I will not accept it. I'm not sure I ""split"" on them however. I always know they might be decent in some ways. But I will not be treated like that and I will lash out, if only in a passive aggressive sort of way.

Mobile-Scar7448,Am I in danger? ,0,1c3sxdb,1,"Hello everyone, posting about my neighbour.

My wife and I live in a shared house, with each of our neighbours living in separate rooms with the kitchen and living area being shared.

We have a neighbour which is acting very strange, and I wanted your guys opinion on if my wife and I should move out.

Details of what is concerning is written below:
Probably the main concern is that we feel like whenever we go to the kitchen to prepare our food or eat is a signal for the neighbour to come as well. At first we thought it was just coincidence, but we've been living in the house with him 6 months now and the feeling hasn't changed.

When he does come to the kitchen he usually walks around without a purpose, as though he is trying to get his steps in or something. He doesn't directly interact with us or anything.

We have noted from the corners of our eye that he stares at us when we are not looking. We also saw him staring at the other neighbour when  that guy came in to the kitchen to grab some food from the fridge and didn't say a word.

We noticed that he often smiles so that we could see his teeth, but he isn't listening to anything and isn't looking at his phone. 

While we are in the kitchen having our meal, he could come in several times and going back to his room numerous times (I know it doesn't sound bad but more details written below). 
He comes into the kitchen, takes out a cup and leaves to his room immediately, only to return back in 10 seconds to take something else out and to leave once again. He could do that non stop for 30 minutes while we are eating.

Another point is him needing something when we start using it. He could be standing next to the sink just browsing his phone for 20 minutes, and as soon as we come over to wash our dishes he will remember that he needs it too and put his phone away. This happens so many times.

In general i think the guys has issues with memory and is clumsy. For example we have a roster for taking out the trash, but each time it's his turn he asks us to remind him. 

Once I left the room just to pick something up from the fridge and he followed me as well(not surprised) and I went back to my room as soon as I grabbed what I needed. I looked back curious what will he do in the kitchen only to see him stop as soon as he entered it, switch on the lights, switch them back off, and started going back into his room.

We noted that he stops following us when he thinks we are not friendly to him, but that lasts only for a few days.

On his first night he locked himself out of his own room at 5 am and my wife and I woke up to the sound of him trying to brake the door down to not skip his work. We were terrified and were afraid to leave the room.

Whenever he enters the kitchen, he cover the windows with blinds no matter what time of day it is, so the kitchen is always dark.

He leaves his stuff in the washing machine, without actually starting to wash them. We often ask him to take his stuff out, only to discover that he just started the machine.

Sometimes when I was my dishes he just stands behind me for a long time, which creeps me tfo.

Does anyone know what is wrong with the guy and if my wife and I should move out or not?
We tried looking him up but could find anything.
He told us that he has a daughter in another country, but we never heard him talking with any of his friends or relatives.

The reason why we are staying is because of the contract and the low rent ( living in Perth, Australia which is experiencing an increase in rent prices now).",1713099221.0,

Dopamine regulation is very important to regulate and sustain good mental health . 

Here are a couple things you could do (and that i do) to keep my brain as naturally charged as possible. 

no1. quitting watching porn. 
no2 . removing promiscuous and adult tv shows from my viewing schedule.
no3. avoiding unnecessary internet use (i.e scrolling social media / youtube binging / random searches that could be solved using people or resources around you other than the web. 

Obviously these 3 habits would be hard to quit all at once . 

It takes 21 days to quit something like a habit. Start off with the first one . Once 21 days has passed move to quitting the next habit etc….

note : This is more of an experiment for you to try to see if it affects your mental health positively. 

It doesn’t have to be forever (unless you want it too be). 

note: It may get mentally taxing and feel like your headspace is getting worse . this is dopamine withdrawal and is a step to recovery .

velvetinchainz,I feel incredibly lonely because… (can someone please give me some answers),0,1c3jajl,11,"I really don’t want to come off as narcissistic so apologies if I do but can someone help me out?

Okay, so I’m 22 years old and I don’t know how else to put this without coming off as a total egotistical prick, but I am intelligent, like, really intelligent, not academically as such, but emotionally, spiritually, that sort of thing. Im well read, extremely well researched, I can understand nuance and read deep between the lines. I analyse everything, I have a passion for cult classic film and media analysis, I absolutely adore music, mostly 60s-70s rock n roll, psychedelic rock, but I also love 80s-2000s punk rock and it’s sub genres, i also love indie bands too but I am fascinated by the progression of rock music and it’s history and how for example blues in the 40s became rock as we know it today. I’m able to pick up on the slightest details in early rock music that was the blueprint for more modern rock (just an example) and I absolutely love analysing and finding the meaning and morals behind each film I watch (mostly psychological thrillers. I enjoy films such as the lobster, the killing of a sacred deer, Trainspotting, the panic in needle park and other artsy films like that with a deeper meaning.) anyway, enough of that. The one thing that really makes me truly believe that I’m an intellectual is that everywhere I go, not one adult (by adult I mean someone in their 30+ and the elderly) all seem to be incredibly  one dimensional and clueless in everything apart from maybe some more experience with things like being independent or careers, but other than that, they’re not full of wisdom in the slightest, they’re not in any way emotionally intelligent because they grew up in a time when psychology wasn’t even talked about (I’m referring to baby boomers predominantly) and I feel as if I have to dumb myself down when conversing with them as they just don’t seem to grasp anything I say, it’s like their outlook on life is purely centred around hard graft and being family oriented and they don’t have any sort of actual personality and they seem disinterested or even confused when I try and discuss anything even slightly more complex with them. Even their vocabulary is shockingly narrow. And they are ignorant on many basic subjects like computer skills, music, TV, even current news. it’s as if they live in a bubble. Another thing that makes me convinced I’m an intellectual is my passion for philosophy, psychology, existentialism and politics, which most people my age couldn’t give a damn about. I’m trying extremely hard not to brag right now but I have been told by others that my intelligence is off the charts, as a child I was a gifted kid, I’ve been told I’m incredibly articulate and a very deep thinker with a quote “beautiful mind” another thing common with intellectuals which is another reason I believe I am one is that I have suffered with mental illness and drug addiction (BPD, depression and anxiety and heroin) which is extremely common in those considered intellectual.

Now that’s out the way, here’s my question which I hope can be answered.

If I am in fact an intellectual, and let’s I assume I am, why do I feel so isolated? Why do I feel like I’m the only one who has depth? Why does it feel like everyone around me are one dimensional and why are the elders around me not so wise and experienced as they’re supposed to be? I despise my intelligence because it’s incredibly lonely with my mind. I feel as if the spotlight is always on me in group settings because people always praise me for my “way with words” and how I’m able to “speak so eloquently” and how I “have such an ability to phrase complex thoughts” and I can’t help it, it’s just how I am. And it sucks. It’s lonely. I feel like the people around me can’t shine because the second I open my mouth, people love the way I speak about things with so much informed detail. Even my doctor was blown away by my chemistry knowledge and knowledge of where the drug supply comes from and how I used all the correct terminology (going back to my heroin use) I feel incredibly alone. I feel like I can’t relate to those around me, even my friends who I love dearly. I feel as if I have to dumb myself down. Sometimes I suspect maybe I’m on the spectrum but apart from my intelligence and love for knowledge, I don’t meet the diagnostic criteria. Anyway, I guess my main question would be “how, as an intellectual, do I stop feeling isolated due to feeling like others around me are one dimensional (I rather not describe them as dumb, because for the most part, that’s innacurate) and why do I feel this way?”

I think my parents divorced when I was 7 and I got barely any memory of it and so I moved to this other family for maybe about 2 years, barely got any memory of that either but I lived there with my big brother as well, after that we moved to our father and lived there for a bit,  we were quite poor which I realized the more I grew up, I didnt get a phone till 7th grade, sometimes I just ate rice and dry sandwiches and my brother seemed to use some of his money to help our situation but then he moved out when I was 5th grade and since everything just became worse  


My father started drinking more and didnt pay much attention, which he never really did, Im glad I didnt have an abusive household but it sure was neglectful  
sometimes he came home from work and just slept or drank so I never was with him I barely know him, same with my brother even though I was very social as a child and I tried it just ended up with me crying myself to sleep every night because I was so socially deprived lol  


anyways, as it got worse and worse and I had no real friends, only ones I had was my ""two best friends"" which I only have because we met in kindergarten and weve known each other since but Im not attatched to them emotionally really  
his drinking and mental health eventually reached the point he had to be hospitalized and then I had to move which funnily enough I remember these people coming home while I was playing something on my PC and told me bout what happened to my father and told me I was going to move somewhere else, I remember specifically crying for the reason that I didnt want to move some place else, I wanted to stay and play the games as I had so I used the little emotions I had and exaggerated them to full on crying so that maybe they would have pity and let me stay there alone which was honestly so stupid in hindsight lmao   


then I moved around a bit and eventually moved to the final location I lived at from 17 to 19, I lived there and it was nice, were lots of animals and I really love cats and there were cats so thats nice  
but that made me realize as more of an adult and actual person that I may be different, I was actually starting to become self aware and was thinking about who I am, what I am how I am why I am and such, whenever I recieved love/care or anything I either felt nothing or felt appalled in a way which doesnt seem right   


fast forward the final bit and here I am, I am 20 and I moved almost a year ago to live alone to study, I have probably done something social about 4-5 times and 2 of them were not at all something I liked  
I feel like I have this extreme sense of need to attatch myself to someone but I can never that someone, whenever Im alone Im just a sack of meat rotting away but when Im with people I even somewhat care for I become a person  
but at the same time most of the time when Im with people or if Im with the same people too long I become a sack of meat and I need to be alone to feel human which is even only momentarily

   
I feel like Im paradoxical by nature I want human connection yet I push everyone away because I cant find the things I want in them   
I also dislike human connection and want to be alone which works for a while then I feel extremely depressed and absolutely crave human connection  
I feel like I feel nothing and everything I do is just something Ive forced myself to, I learnt that laughing is good so now I just laugh at everything and sometimes at inappropiate times  
I started thinking retrospectively and realized my personality is just an almagination of virtual characters Ive put together that I fancied   
I have no motivation no discipline for the last year I barely went to classes I have made two attempts to seek friends irl and it just made me feel empty so I stopped, I barely clean or do anything at all   
the only thing I can do is just sit, listen to music/play games or whatever for a little bit before I get extremely depressed, the only thing that has worked in the past to help me get  through the day doesnt work anymore, when I play games I feel this extreme sense of depression or a void in me whatever  


My mind is also completely blank, theres nothing up there consciously, I know Im thinking about stuff because sometimes especially when something more tramautic happens I just sit and stare at something and let it process for some hour(s), the only way Im thinking consciously is by talking to myself literally, by using my tounge and mouth movement like IM talking to myself but without using my vocal cords   
I dont even know how Im getting these words through right now or what Im thinking or feeling  


  
Im not diagnosed with anything, I wish I could have at least seen a psychatrist or something when I was younger but that obviously didnt happen  
I feel like I want to kill myself  
I also feel like I want to go out and kill  
I do love myself and I care for myself  
but I feel like I dont love myself and I obviously dont care for myself   
and I know I wont actually do anything, but at the same time Im actually not so sure   
I definitely dont have multiple personalites at least but it feels like I had and then they got squished together into one weird amalgamation but I guess thats just natural considering I picked personality traits and identites and squished them into my personality   


this was my funny rant ask me anything say anything I dont even know what I want to achieve with this ",1713054874.0,
,I think I'm a sociopath and I want to know other people's opinions,1,1c3fmgu,2,"Before start, please read: I don't want to romanticize sociopathy or anything like that, I come here to ask for help because lately it's gotten worse, and I'm afraid that what I have could affect my life when I'm older, and affect my actions, I need help, I've been like this for a long time and as I grew up, it got worse, but I believe I wasn't born like this, so I don't think it's psychopathy, not only because of that but because some aspects of psychopathy dont fit me, as for sociopathy, it's practically bingo on everything, I don't want to look like an edgy teenager or whatever; I'm 16 years old and I'm a girl. This is not my main reddit account and I'm going to post this in a few more subreddits because I didn't know which one to specifically talk about, I'll try not to give too many details so it doesn't end up being a long post (its already long enough) And if anyone thinks it's not sociopathy but something else, please tell me, I'm not trying to diagnose myself, and as I said, I'm not old enough to be diagnosed, I went to a psychologist once and the experience was horrible , I went to another one and it was better, but unfortunately I didn't go back because my parents don't commit with those stuff and forger about me, but I'm going to ask to go to a psychologist again.

English is not my native language and I'm writing with the help of the translator, so please be patient because sometimes Google Translate is a bit literal

I'm not going to say much about the events of my childhood, my parents divorced when I was 7 years old, my mother and I went through difficulties together, but she took out her frustrations on me, my parents were very immature and argued a lot over the phone, Nowadays I live with my father, he has changed A LOT and has become a better person, although I have always identified more with my father. He has always been my confidant despite us sometimes arguing badly, lately that has stopped, I recently started living with him and stopped spending 15 days with my father and 15 days with my mother, which is what I did since I was 11 yo, besides not being something I liked anymore, I always wanted to live with my father, and it was tiring being in two houses all the time, nowadays my father and my mother are friends.

When I was 9 years old, my mother kicked me out of the house, she threw a bag of clothes in my face through the window and didn't let me in the house, it was night, so I ran out and she found me a few hours later in a grocery store. city, which had a lot of people around me, then the commotion caught her attention, I remember a mother who was with her daughter gave me a snack and I looked at the two of them and thought ''I would like to be like that with my mom instead of running away here''

in no way wanting to victimize me, but I suffered a lot during my parents' divorce, and it wasn't even because I wanted the two of them together, in fact that was the least of the problems, I didn't even cared about that, but because I was always listening to his fights , my mother was always angry, she gave me silent treatment all the time, called me fake, snake, liar and everything, and I was 9 years old, I am aware that I endured a lot for a child, there are no words to describe how immature my parents were at that time, and I honestly don't even know where the maturity I had at that time came from, but it was always more than their maturity combined, my mother and father always told me that

My mother always, and to this day, labels me as selfish, without empathy and anything possible, it always seemed like she thought I was evil, but it wasn't true

At the age of 10, my anger problems appeared, but I never had problems cutting myself, in fact that wasn't what made me feel better, my anger only went away when I scratched my arms and legs, sometimes I hit my head against the wall repeatedly , I have a scar on my forehead that I made by scratching with my fingernail, until it bled, and my anger was disproportionate to the situations, sometimes it was, but in most of them not, I've already broken a computer by punching it and a few other things (AGAIN, I'M NOT PROUD OF THESE THINGS, I'm just reporting facts that happened) this type of thing was recurrent. My mom never wanted to hear what I had to say, the few times I tried to tell her about my anger issues, or vent about how I felt about EVERYTHING, she invalidated me, said I was retarded and was trying to appear traumatized. Anyway, I never spoke to anyone again about how I feel, now the main point

I'm always getting into trouble at school, I simply can't respect hierarchy, and they called my mother at school because I turned a boy's desk upside down and piled up trash, etc., they told my mother that I'm ""not I know how to respect rules, I always try to justify myself and I don't accept that I'm wrong, I don't know how to respect authority figures and many other things'' Many people have called me manipulative, and I admit that yes, that's not something to be proud of and I I'm not proud of it, but I use people to my advantage, if they have no relevance to me then I don't care about them, as I grew up, my lack of empathy increased, to the point where I don't even care about them. my best friend, but I try hard to seem like it, don't get me wrong, I try to be a good friend, I think the only people I really love are my father and my best friend (my other best friend) I I care about him so much, I really like him, but that's it, I have been friends for 11 years and my regard for them is 0, I hate my two half sisters, and one of them is 2 years old, and lives with me, the other sister I barely know her and I've only seen her once in my life, she's the daughter of another stepmother I had, not the current one, who is the mother of the 2-year-old girl, just hearing my sister call my name makes me want to kick her in the face, I despise my stepmother, and I despise my sister, my biggest wish is that he abandons them both like he did with my other sister, he just sends her childsupport and goodbye.

I usually steal things, stealing from big places, to the point of leaving with two bags full, and honestly, if my stepmother got pregnant again I would hit her belly with a squeegee until the child gave up on coming into the world.

I don't like being like this, I want to be able to love, I've never dated anyone in my life, don't get me wrong, I'm even considered a pretty person by other people, I simply don't feel attracted to anyone, I've never felt attracted to anyone in my life. .

Some of my friends think I have autism, because I have some exaggerated cleaning habits, I don't have many expressions, and when my friends need comfort, I don't know how to do it, and I leave the work to others, in fact, I'm a very logical person and not at all emotional, you can come to me and ask for logical advice and I will give you the solution right away, but please don't ask me for emotional support.

I let them think I have autism, so they think they understand me and won't think I'm just inconsiderate of them

but I'm afraid, afraid that one day I'll let my selfish thoughts win and I'll end up physically hurting someone, in the past I took it out on myself, but now taking it out on others is what would end my impulsive anger, I can't feel sorry for anyone, like my best friend who I really like, I help him as much as I can when he has financial difficulties in his family, but I don't feel sorry, I don't feel anything, sometimes I feel like an empty shell that only has bad feelings to offer to the world, I want to be able to truly love someone and live a happy relationship, love someone more than I would love myself, and I feel like I'm wasting my life and missing out on experiences because of this lack of emotion.

Some things I forgot to mention is that I am capable of feeling remorse, regret, etc., I'm not like a psychopath who doesn't feel anything, a few more things is that I'm a good liar, my advice to my friend who doesn't know how to lie is , believe in what you say and others will believe it too.

I feel like I can turn off my feelings whenever I want and I easily lose my regard for someone as if someone has pressed a button, I know there is something wrong with me and I want help, I don't want to be like that

That's it, sorry for the long post, please don't judge me, I'm not like that because I want to and i am not a bad person, I would really like to know other people's opinions",1713051676.0,

This story is basically a question which is still unanswered to me. It is a tragic and sad story of mine which occurred because of some actions which I committed in the past and then I faced their serious consequences in life.

&#x200B;

College Life

&#x200B;

Let's begin the story. It was at the start of my college life that I started Maladaptive Daydreaming. Maladaptive Daydreaming is an addiction which takes man to an imaginary self created world. After some time, I became addicted to MDD badly. At the end of my 1st year of college, I became highly emotional and started being rude, bold and over-confident in my college. The reason behind that behavior is intense emotions and emotionally charged moments of MDD. It was a period of 3-4 months with extreme emotions and overconfident state. I referred to this period as ""Confidence Period"" Then my 1st year of college ended and that emotional bad state also ended simultaneously. Now my 2nd year has started. At the beginning of 2nd year, I suddenly became extremely religious. I used to offer prayers and religious rituals mostly all day. I started hating and ignoring my studies badly. I used to sit alone in my room also avoiding my family and I was badly indulged in religious activities. It was also a period of ""4-5"" months with no studying and religious affairs only. Consequently, I failed in my midterms exams of second year. Then my family came to know about my situation and mindset. They counseled and told me that education is also very important besides religion. We have to do everything in balance. In short, I realized I was wrong and promised them that I will study harder now and clear my final exams.

&#x200B;

Wastage of Year

&#x200B;

Now the real story begins here. I realized that I was wrong and I decided to study more and move forward in life. After my midterms , college classes started again. But, the main issue started here that after the religious extremism span of 4-5 months, I got stuck in a very strange mental condition. It was like uncontrollable  cycle of immense thoughts in my mind. An unstoppable cycle of deep thoughts started in my mind and I was completely unable to break that circuit. The nature of thoughts was religious mostly. It was like that there existed a ""tough world"" inside my head and I was living in that head world instead of living in this world. I was only physically present here but mentally I went to my ""internal head world"" and I was not able to come out of that situation. I got completely worried and frustrated. Due to this problem, I was unable to study and read books. My education got seriously affected due to this issue. Now my final college exams came and I decided to drop ""Physics Paper"". When I dropped the exam of physics. I could not took admission in University and my entire one year got wasted. In that year, I remained much frustrated and depressed. Even in the second attempt of Physics Paper, it was difficult for me to pass the exam but I got through it. So, It is a brief summary of my college life period that what I did and later on what I suffered later on.

&#x200B;

My University Life

&#x200B;

Now I will discuss my university life here. Then after 1 year, I got admission in University in Engineering. In university life, my mental situation was better than college time but my mind was still damaged due to the consequences of that condition. Now, in university life, the same situation occurred but with lower intensity than college where I used to go campus, sit in classrooms and could not get any knowledge or any information from the entire lectures. I used to travel to university daily to learn engineering passionately and I tried my best to pay attention to teachers during lectures and labs but unfortunately I failed here also. This university life was a time span of 4 years. So, this situation continued these 4 years and my graduation life badly got destroyed. However, somehow I managed to clear the semesters and finish the degree on time but I could not get any concept about engineering. In short, my entire graduation life suffered badly because of the mental damages of the ""Religious Incident"" of College time.

&#x200B;

My Unemployment

&#x200B;

After graduation, I have also done masters but I am still jobless. I got rejected in multiple interviews by HR and I could not earn a single penny. If I look deeply into the roots of this issue, the primary factor I always find is the ""Mental Slowness"" I went through. So, this is also a very embarrassing and shameful situation.

&#x200B;

I Cannot Drive the Car

&#x200B;

Moreover, I also want to discuss an important issue of my story. In college, I tried to learn car driving. At that time, I was suffering from a mental problem so I failed to learn to driving properly. I used to go with my father in the car and practiced driving on an empty road but these efforts got wasted. There was some delay of a few seconds in decisions during my driving so my father did not allow me to drive the car alone. This issue also existed in my university life. A number of times, I tried to drive a car actively, but the slowness of my mind became the hurdle and I failed badly. In the last year of graduation, I quit learning car driving and till the date I cannot drive the car standing in my own home's garage. I feel embarrassed many times in my family because of this incapability and failure and often my cousins make fun of myself that he is so dumb he cannot drive a car. This is also a side effect of my mental inner world trauma which I went through and my mind became slowed in functioning. Hence, In both college and university life, I faced problems in car driving practice and it became a sad aspect of my life.

&#x200B;

My Today’s Personality

&#x200B;

So, I can say that 90% of my today's personality is based on that incident of ""Mental Internal Immense Thoughts World"" which happened after almost 4-5 months of religious rituals. In fact, it is involved in each and everything I do in my life. I went to university, I gave full attention to lectures but I experienced much difficulty in understanding. I went a number of times to learn car driving, tried my best to focus on the road but this hindrance existed there and I failed badly. Now I still cannot drive a car and am also jobless as well. These are only 2 prominent failures of mine instead there are hundreds of others which I could not mention here. My life GOT badly destructed and damaged. 

&#x200B;

Conclusion

&#x200B;

Lastly, I say that I am trying hard to build a successful and prosperous career and recover from all the negative consequences of this trauma. I hope I will shine one day surely. But one thing I want to know is what my condition was and what it is called in terms of psychology. It is one of the most important questions of my life and I want to explore this. If anyone has experienced the same situation as me, you can share with me, and if anyone knows exactly about the psychological fact of this condition then kindly inform me about the reality of this issue. I am not a psycho nor mad instead I am a 100% normal and intelligent guy, however this issue I refer to as only ""Mental Slowness"". as it slowed my brain and senses functioning. So, the only purpose of this post is just to know the reality of my mental slowness. I will be highly grateful for any kind of help from you people.

xxchlo3xx,"How do I support my friend, I'm am so lost.",1,1c3asof,0,"I have known by best friend for about a decade now. They've got mental health problems as do I, but within the past year or so it's gotten worse for them (and me, but I am dealing with it in a healty way dw) 

Anyway, they watched an show a while ago that had a character in it that was very relatable to him. But within the past , maybe 8 months, he fully believes that he is that character. 
I don't know how to describe it properly, I've tried talking to him about it a lot, but it doesn't really go anywhere. He gets triggered by things that killed his character in the show, he dissociates a lot (more so than he used to) and a lot of other things, including intense content intrusive thoughts that are violent in nature.

I feel like I'm explaining this badly, mainly because he doesn't talk about it in much detail unless he's drunk.
But I can't even try to explain to him that it's not possible and he's not said character because he gets so angry/upset. This character is a murderer in the show. 

I know you're going to tell me to tell him to go to therapy, but it's not that easy. The mental health team in our area is REALLY bad, I've been under them for nearly 2years and I don't have a regular therapist or anything like that. 

I feel even if he did go to therapy, he wouldn't/ couldn't talk to them about it, and I'm worried that if a therapist tried to tell him that he's not said character he would flip out and possibly attack them. 

I don't know how to help him, and I am constantly worried about him. But I can't speak to him about it really, in the fear I'm going to send him into a worse spiral or that I'm going to get hurt. (He would NEVER hurt me intentionally/ if he's in his right mind) infact near 10years of friendship and we've never even had an argument.

Special-Dare4218,Roommate issues,1,1c33nk8,4,"I live with my best friend - we have been friends off and on and never lived together. She has bipolar 1. They have usually manic episodes around this time every few years. (She is due for one)

-she will have brief Episodes of like sobbing but it’s like for a second

She wants to get her tongue pierced. Not against her doing that at all but last time she did similar things she was manic. She hasn’t been talking about it for months. Just now all of a sudden.

She is making strange comments. She is a nerd so am I but stuff she says just sounds bizarre. She talks to AI models a lot.  ‘How things will be when the machines take over’ -  she has a point?

Also yesterday I found out they got back together with their ex (it’s long distance - they had trust issues. - I’m not upset they are back together I’m upset she didn’t talk to me about it for weeks they were together they didn’t mention it)

I routinely ask if they are taking their meds, feel stable, and have appointments with their providers - all to which they say yes. 

I’ve had bad luck with roommates in the past. She is my best friend. She has burned bridges with friends. And at times we were NC but we always find a way back to each other. 

 I’ve always known about her MH issues. And but my gut tells me something is off.  Am I being paranoid?

I think I’m just looking for support. Or what to do if something does happen?  Do I get the brother involved? which is their only family.

PolyAcid,What should I bring to a crisis house?,4,1c2w0xs,10,"Hi, I’m going to be staying in a crisis house for 1-2 weeks on Monday/Tuesday. It’s the kind you can leave freely, it’s basically like a house share but with 24/7 staff and they do special activities/meetings to help you learn to cope and build resilience.

I’m really looking forward to it and want to get the most out of those sessions while one there, but they’re only like 1 hour a day.

They told me to take anything that brings me comfort and some art supplies. Idk whether to take my laptop or not.

They want to encourage us to not stay in our rooms the entire time. They have a tv/Xbox and pool table in the lounge area.

If anyone has been to one do you have any ideas of what you wished you’d taken with you? It can be anything, it’s not a lockup facility and they won’t take things off me it’s literally a calming home for 2 weeks max.

ESPECIALLY my sister now that she's passed. i'm very sad abt my sister passing but it feels as though when i rant to my parents, all of my problems either boil down to ""girly college problems!!"" or ""divorce"" or ""my sister"" and i feel like it just leads to so much being overlooked. examples
- when my sister moved into college we all helped and it was sad and we cried. when i moved in it was just my dad helping and it was very anticlimactic and i just got a hug.
- before moving into the dorms i had a convo w my dad where i expressed that i was sad to be moving out and that id miss him a lot ""yea i miss you guys a lot now that ur growing up and especially ur sister too""
- when i got a 4.3 gpa in hs i was very proud and my parents were like ""yea i think ur sister got about the same!!!""

lately at collrge i've been making multitudes of friends and i've ""cracked the code"" to being pretty and popular, and for the past couple weeks i've been very happy and very stylish and very outgoing and my friendships are all going perfectly. as summertime approaches though i've been forced to face the question of ""where will i go in the summer"" bc my parents are both off in new places and my friends are all where they use to live. i've been distracting myself with crushing on ladies and hitting college bars and frats but im losing hope in myself.

i feel like im losing a sense of who i am because of all of these distractions and i do plan to go to the counseling center tomorrow but i just don't know where im at and i don't know what i want and what i can even fix. it all feels up in the air and out of my control even if im so in control of the college grind. also don't worry my grades are fine. everything i CAN be in control of i feel in control of",1712991836.0,

MochaMeansPiss,Finally realizing my self image was so wrong for years,4,1c24815,2," 

dont know why but years ago I started to just assume I was a complete loser. I was anxious and shy, I was worried people wanted to avoid me, I felt so gross and just unlikeable for years.

I believed that it was all true too. I went out of my way to avoid people to prevent any discomfort for them.

It was only after others have started opening up to me about their own issues which sounded very similar to mine, maybe even worse. Depression, anxiety, negative self talk and image...

But when I'd see them in public I would have NEEEEEEVER thought they went through so much inner mental turmoil.

They looked normal, maybe with a passing thought of ""hmm they seem a bit shy"" or ""they aren't are talkative or loud as other people.""

Never did I look at these people and think they were fucking disgusting and should be avoided at all costs.

It also explains why throughout the years I always seemed to still attract people but basically forced myself away from them thinking it was a fluke or ended up pushing them away with my own stubbornness and refusal to accept them.

I literally was the problem for myself.

I have been trying really hard to not let these thoughts control me and I've been making lots of progress. Those close to me have even made comments here and there about how I just seem more easy going and open than before. Not as stiff, not as quiet, not as reluctant.

I'm so worried about her every single day!  ***trigger warning...self harm/assault,6,1c1wzsb,0,"I'm very concerned about my daughter. She had a lot of very unfortunate things happen over the course of one year, the majority of which were severely unfair and beyond her control. She lost several family members (7) in one year, had to repeat a year of med school, has been fighting to get her drivers license back since she was 17 and denied again for no reason, had her live in boyfriend assault her, etc. After much pleading, she finally agreed to try antidepressants. The idiot psychologist thought zoloft would be a great start for someone in med school who is also diagnosed with severe ptsd, major depressive disorder and anxiety. 

She didn't react to it well. She was only on it for a few days but the effects lasted an additional week after she stopped taking it.

She was uncontrollably yawning, extremely lethargic and basically incapable of handling daily living activities during this time. 

It is understandable she wouldn't want to try another but we desperately need her to. She was placed in a psych ward temporarily a month ago and they released her. She is adamant that if we send her back,  she will harm herself. Even talking about it sends her into a tailspin of nonsensical obsessing over it and making everyone promise not to send her. 

She is seeing a therapist once every other week but it seems like everything else she is doing is not helpful and she won't do anything to help herself or allow us to. She hasn't been eating. I know she doesn't have much money and I have offered numerous times to send her money, have groceries delivered, whatever she needs. She refuses bc she said she is too stressed out to even figure out what she needs right now.

I have been dealing with this ever since about 2nd or 3rd grade and now I’m an 8th grades moving into high school still dealing with this shit. But I really don’t know what exactly caused these kind of urges or thoughts but I can pin point some ideas. When I was little my mom and my dad were going through a divorce (btw he walked out of my life and i don’t have to deal with him anymore) anyways, he would do drugs and little me didn’t understand. So one time my mom decided to go on a cruise to get a break from the kids which left me and my two younger sisters there in the house with him. And me being the eldest I was, wasn’t listening to him. Ya know typical little kid stuff, he got mad and beat the shit out of me with the belt, I my whole body was practically burning. Even some parts of my body might’ve felt numb. And I come from a Christian family and in the Bible it explains about disciplining so my elementary school brain at the time took that as normal. It was normal for my own dad to beat me a little girl. Besides at the time I couldn’t grasp how serious that event was so I never said anything to my mom and still haven’t to this day. Another reason to why I wanna end my life is because of the past self harm scars, I stopped now not cause i wanted to but because my mom found in 5th grade maybe 4th, this was when the suicidal thoughts really started to form (and I do still believe that if I were gone everyone would be better without me) I went most of my elementary life self harming without even realizing it was self harm. When my mom found out i somehow convinced her I was fine and didn’t do it again because i didn’t wanna stress my mom out. Now the summer before 6th grade for me I forced my self to be okay I practically convinced myself that I was fine. But gradually over two years later, which is now, they have come back and worse then before. It mainly happens when in do something wrong or when males yell at me when I do something wrong (thats connected to my trauma of my dad beating me).

Though they really did not push through anything so I've been living with these thoughts for years now. I'm quite scared of getting it checked up because to be honest, my past guidance talks really did not help and if i ever hear another ""you'll be fine, it's just stress"", I genuinely just want to die.

I didn't consider going to an actual therapist because there really are times that I genuinely feel fine. I felt fine lately but there are times when I feel extremely sad and times where I get unnecessarily pissed as well. I am able to manage myself as u can see I'm still alive and typing this, but it feels lonely that whenever I say my actual thoughts and feelings no one could understand.

Even I do not trust my closest friends sometimes even if they say they truly care for me because I know it won't last, and they'll get tired of this.

What made me feel more wary about my condition, except for the more frequent breakdowns and the clear idea of taking my life,  was the feeling that I do not recognize myself sometimes. I feel like only live to perform this person they recognize but I know that's not me and I do not know who I really am. I lie to take advantage of people's pity and create an image that is likeable. And what's weirder is that I do not feel empathy towards any controversial topics that people think really matters or is not socially accepted like SA, pdphlia. I do not feel hurt when someone feels hurt but I know how to comfort them and I am aware it hurts them. I feel like I've been living a lie to just make people see me normal.

HATESLAVE6,I haven't wanted to continue living in a long time despite 'improvement',1,1c1zgor,2,"I'm pretty complex. Diagnosed schizoaffective early in life, later denied by literally everyone. I spent many years on medications, mainly from 24 years old to now, 30. I had a sort of turning point at 27 where I started to clean myself up.

Problem I feel is the damage has been done already. I'm on maybe 1/5th of the medications I used to be on but still feel hopeless. It actually makes me feel worse. It makes me feel like I should have never been on any in the first place and I got scammed by the pharmacies/psychiatrists into becoming dependent on very powerful, and in my opinion, dangerously bad medications.

I have been a smoker again now for like 2 and a half years. This is a huge root of my frustrations. I cannot explain the depression that comes from this addiction. The feeling that everyday instead of improving myself, i'm ruining myself.

I blame the medications because I was and am still on, a lower dose though, of antipsychotics that block dopamine. Seems like i'm always chasing dopamine.

I would say I haven't had any “real” friends ever. I'm about to graduate high school and go to college but I really couldn't care less. Everyday I wake up and I do the same thing. I stopped going to school and started doing remote because it's gotten so bad. Everyone in my school pretends l'm invisible (I mean like actually invisible like l will say something to them and they know they hear it they just don't care to address or acknowledge it) (plus no one ever works with me) and no one ever has reached out to me looking for any sort of connection. l've had a conversation with a few people but most of the time it dies down slowly after meeting them. I don't know what's wrong with me. I have normal interests. I like rap, video games, and manga. I'm aware I'm a nerd and I'm proud of it. It doesn't mean I shouldn't have anyone to talk to? I see so many people with my interests having fun. Going to concerts, Laughing, going out with people, playing games. I talk to a few people but they aren't kind people and it's really out of a desperation. They use slurs often in really rude ways. It hurts too because they constantly say the r slur and I was constantly bullied in middle school and was called that so it hurts in a almost ptsd way (I say that with no disrespect to the actual reality of ptsd I know it's much more severe and painful in reality). They are aware of this and they don't care since ""it's just a word"". I stopped talking to them as much because of it, it's been a double edged sword though as while it made not hurt as much from hearing their hate I know was truly alone and had no friends. friends. l've had friends in the past too but I say I have no ""real"" friends because they used me because I had a gaming computer earlier than most kids growing up so they constantly came to use it. Since I was so lonely I was ignorant to it at the time. (These kids also bullied me it was a really bad dynamic). I know this may be rambling but I need to get this out because just sitting and doing the same thing everyday alone is so lonely. I wish everyday this pain could go away and it doesn't. My mom just says wait till college but that's months from now (18m btw sorry for not saying that earlier). It just feels like it's getting worse everyday and my work output is decreasing and it's making me scared I won't even get to college tbh.

Anyway thanks for reading this if you got to the end. If you'd like feel free to reach out. We can talk about music or what not.

The realization of this made me immediately only step on the colored tile that took up the majority of the floor, this happened when I went to step on a red tile and I averted my foot promptly. This has now moved past just floor tiles, and it has consumed my life, anything that is on the floor that does not take up the majority of the segment that I am walking in, I can not step on, my body will not let me.

in the last several weeks, my parents have flipped almost a complete 180. a couple weeks ago they gave me a very genuine, heartfelt apology for my upbringing. 

the reality of them beginning their own healing has finally settled in for me and grappling with that has been incredibly difficult. im starting to realize that i dont have to be strong for them anymore and its completely floored me, as i genuinely don't know how to live without having to do that. 

ive accepted that even though it feels like my life is falling apart, things are really just falling into place. in spite of my hyperindependence, i scheduled a therapy intake for myself today. accepting the fact that i need help and getting it was my personal hell. but i did it. im very proud of myself which is a feeling im not used to.

Sometimes, he'll whisper things like he'll cut me in mid-sentence and when I ask what he said, he makes me think I misheard things.

He even fantasized that we'd kill people together and he said he was only joking, but I don't think he was.

If I need to vent, he'll even go as far as to say, ""Do you want me to kill them?""(If someone made me angry.) He said he got the line from some Adam Sandler movie.

One time, he made the comment that he hasn't been caught yet and this was in reference to me asking him if he was going to kill me.

He is strange.

He laughs and I think he believes it's funny.

Like, he laughs when my day goes wrong or something happens to upset me.

He even said he has a disorder where he is ""asleep"", but he can actually have intercourse with someone and not even realize it. (That women have taken advantage of this.) They don't stop him, etc

So, he stated anyone sleeping next to him  could also be ""raped"" by him because he blacks out and he isn't aware of what he is doing. (Sounds like an excuse to rape someone and blame it on a medical condition.)

He's just weird

He laughs and thinks it's funny when I am appalled and in shock. He says he's only joking, but this isn't normal at all

I should maybe stop talking to him because he makes me question his motives.

Sidenote: He was once addicted to pain killers and meth...did cocaine also.

No clue why I keep running into men who have a drug history, when I'm the complete opposite and don't even smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. (I only have alcohol maybe 3 times a year.)

Should I steer clear from him?

Suicide

Might generally be a better post on the mental health sub reddit, but I think I already posted quite a lot there and derivatives of the situations are slightly starting to slide into the territory of actual mental illness so I hope it's appropriate.

My mental configuration/emotional depth/complexity/personality gets significantly worse after every time I sleep due to currently undefined, unconventional form of epilepsy and nighttime focal seizures that never stopped for almost 12 years in a row now.

It has gone to a point that I have absolutely no mental tools to handle or address anything, so everything just comes down to immature basic insintinctual tendencies of survival of the ego.
Because I have to prioritize behaviour over trying to maximize internal comfort, I have to now instead of trying to understand things, which will ultimately fail and encourage bad thinking patterns, I have to repress things and just follow whatever I judge to be right without actually being able to intuitively support it.
On top of the extensive personality change that and newly acquired mental instability, trying to follow behavioural patterns you no longer truly understand puts me in a state of constant stress, and I know non of this would be able to be sustainable.

Suicide is the only reasonable option, as it is very unlikely I would be able to get help at all, and most definitely not under a reasonable timespan.
But my brain doesn't naturally leans in that direction at all, no matter how bad things get. It just always lowers the bar of what is considered acceptable and forget about the idea of killing itself if it isn't constantly, somewhat artificialy reminded of it. But I think I am incredibly irresponsible for not doing it.

I am just so helpless and no one gets this kind of situation, I wanted to die even earlier before I had any constant stress or any form of depression, because my quality of life just always went down.
I obviously don't want to symptomatically treat the stress itself with any kind of substance, as it is perfectly proportional and I can't risk being indifferent to bad behaviour or thought patterns. And the last thing I need is to add more parameters I may or may not be able to partially isolate into the equation.

Thank you if you read all of this, I am unfortunately in a situation where I have to constantly actively think about it at this point, because I cannot trust where things are going at all as the mental landscape changes and my brain constantly recalculates to fit the new baseline, and have to make sure things are under control",1712819071.0,

Sadofficeboi,Healing or Emotionally Numb? - outsider Opinion (not diagnosis or anything like that) needed pls TW: Selfharm & Suicide,1,1c0vbp3,2,"Hey, I am posting on this subreddit as me and my Therapist are both clueless as to what it is and I am hoping someone who may have experienced something like this could “help”. 

For Background: 

I am a 19y/o man with bpd (diagnosed). The first time I have shown depression symptoms was when I was 8/9.
I have also taken Fluoxetine since 2021 but have put it off around 6-7ish months ago cause I started forgetting it constantly and realised that they don’t do anything anymore. (I have had to up my dosage 3 times for that exact reason)

For the past 9-10 months or so I have been feeling fairly numb/apathetic. Like I cannot tell how I am feeling, what I am feeling or what I am experiencing. I also have no seeming emotional connection/attachment like feeling to anything/anyone (sometimes not even my cats, which leads to me getting irritated by them fast), I just rationally know I like my friends and love my friends. On top of that 99% of my day feels like I am stuck in some form of VR-experience; it just doesn’t feel real. 

Before that I had very hard mood swings (for example: I was feeling fine for like an entire morning and in the afternoon/evening I broke down hard and became borderline suicidal for no apparent reason). This has also lead to a selfharm addiction which started at age 11.
I also had very strong feelings to my friends and especially Partners and my babies (leading to extreme paranoia when leaving the house, as something might happen to them)

Now I currently feel nothing as stated, though 1-2 a week the urge to self harm and/or end myself comes up and the only reason why I haven’t attempted or selfharmed is because I was too tired to do anything. 
My superior has told me that I seem to be doing better yet I do not feel different. (Here my therapist suspects I might be masking) 

As everything seems conflicting it begs the question: 

Am I getting better/healing or just emotionally numb?

Thank you for reading.",1712780056.0,

Luc1d_Dr34ms,I need help,2,1c0g9h7,0,"hi, I kinda just wanna rant here about how I feel because recently I've been having a hard time cooperating with my parents regarding my feelings (if this post is inappropriate I will take it down).

I'm hoping to find some people here who can somewhat relate to what I'm experiencing currently. I'm in high school but I'm in one of those so-called ""star sections"", which is 's.t.e' (not the stem course because you can choose that for seniors in my school). Ever since I got into this school, my health and mental state have been messed up over the years but my parents tell me it's because I am not ""disciplined enough"". I love my parents and I know my parents love me but sometimes their methods of teaching me a lesson hurt me because most of the time they would spank me or hit me in general or just tell me that I'm not trying any harder and I need to be further disciplined. Because I grew up around them yelling and raising their tone at me it's been hard to control my emotions if someone with a strict tone just starts to get louder and idk I get kinda scared and then I cry. Tomorrow we go back to school and I was playing on my PC earlier to pass the time then my dad saw me and raised his voice at me to tell me ""You're wasting your time doing these things, do you want us to stop you from your education for you just to play? Do you want that?"". He says this often but right then and there I kinda of cried in front of him because I hadn't used my PC for anything else besides communication and studies since my section was packed with so many assignments and presentations given, then he asked why I was crying and why do I need to cry over my game that I could play some other time - other time being rarely because I'm also busy on weekends to help out at home or church.

It doesn't help that most of my classmates look down upon me due to having lower scores than them (They get at least 93 or 95 and above while I usually get 90-91 which is still good because I can get 'honors') and I found out through my other friend that they called me self-centered, nosy and straight up annoying because I helped them out in a subject I enjoy. I can't seem to enjoy the things I like anymore like my art because I rarely have time and some other hobbies I don't do much anymore, I start to get more sluggish in my work and it's like I don't have the energy to put into something anymore as I get drained. I want to go to therapy because of this but my parents might think it's a waste of money and I'm copying my older sister since she was recently diagnosed with depression so I consult other older people instead. There's more I'd like to say but I feel like talking about it more won't do anything. I hope some people on here can somewhat relate and tell me their experiences because I'm trying so hard to be normal for once.

Bibbswalden,Listening ,3,1c0diyy,3,"I so fucking wish people were capable of listening to understand, listening to sympathize, listening to care, and not just listening to “fix” or even worse, not listening at all and seemingly just thinking of what they’re gonna say next. 

As someone with GAD, MDD, and cPTSD, it’s really hard for me to trust and open up to even those I consider really good friends. In the off chances I do feel empowered to open up, it’s almost always met with seemingly not listening or really paying attention and offering a solution when all I wanted was sympathetic ears. Being mentally ill is so fucking exhausting. I’m so exhausted on every single level and just done with everything. If it weren’t for my dogs I’d have a hard time sticking around. 

I know my hopelessness is a symptom of my MDD, but seriously, how do y’all find hope when living and existing with mental illness s just pure exhaustion?

kinda_confused_6,How Should I Approach Codependency?,2,1c0d45m,1,"I (18F) have been struggling with my emotions towards a specific person in my life, who I'll be referring to as M. I had a crush on M a few years back. I'm beginning to think this ""crush"" was more of a codependency I had for him. 

The crush started when I was 13, I was attending a new school, going through some family issues, and hated being at school because I felt alone. I met M and developed a crush on him. By the age of 14, I had been able to start texting him and that's when I noticed how anxious I got when he didn't reply. And the rush I got when he did. It took me until I was 16 to finally get over him. Throughout those two years, he got a girlfriend, cut me off completely, and hung out with a guy that sexually harassed me. This entire thing had me floored and shattered. I remember that my day was ruined whenever he wouldn't talk to me but, when he showed the tiniest bit of care - the bare minimum - I would get so happy.

It was a rollercoaster, it was exhausting. It was one of the worst experiences. In order to get over him, I had to force myself to hate him. I don't hate him, I still care so much for him - not in the crushing manner - as I discovered since he's been forced back into my life. I noticed the same pattern starting again, too. I thought no contact for a couple years would help but, it didn't. I don't know what to do. I hate that part of my happiness revolves around him. It's exhausting. Hence why I need advice on how to approach codependency and unlearn it.",1712723986.0,

They are really smart, bright, but had anxiety/panic symptoms (which they masked as stomach pains in the beginning) which brought them to leave school and homeschool, then drop out.

I keep in touch via messages. They still seem sane. They want full responsibility themselves to get to a medical provider. However they haven’t been able to bring themself to do that. Always lacking motivation. Year after year they have goals to get out of the house. 

Parents have always been split on what to do. One says to respect their child’s boundaries + decisions (my sibling wants to take full responsibility). Other one is all for forcing medical help.

Romzvesen,I don’t feel like a person,2,1c05d4g,1,"My name is Jade, I’m 16 years old, and I recently downloaded this app. I’m absolutely hopeless right now, as a lot of people on this app probably are let’s be honest.
I was born with some sort of chemical imbalance in my brain, so I was kinda fucked up from the start. I would not stop crying or screaming. My parents first took me in to doctors when I was 2, and they didn’t know. Eventually I moved, being a military child. Over the years, I saw many, many, many, doctors, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc. and still. Nothing. 
When I was 7, I started to really realize how much of a nightmare child I was, and I felt bad. My dad would get rather abusive with me around then, which isn’t okay but at the same time I can’t help but slightly understand why. I was ruining my parent’s lives because of my nonstop meltdowns. I didn’t know what suicide or self harm was or any of that, but I would scratch myself, then I would use thumbtacks to scratch myself, I remember fantasizing about vehicles just hitting me, and my body would have a note just saying that I’m sorry. Just wanting to die so that no one would have to worry anymore. 
When I was 9, I moved again and went to one of the worst elementary schools, this would’ve been around my 4th change in schools. They had no councilors, no paras, nothing. So they didn’t know what the hell to do with me. I would start to hurt myself more by rubbing broken pencils on myself, banging my head, and pulling out my hair. Eventually, I was homeschooled due to the school not being good and my behavior. After that, I moved again. Going to a new school with about 1.4K people, going class to class, being in a new state and environment, it was all too big of a change, so it only got worse. I did all of the other things I mentioned, plus I started cutting myself and eventually attempting suicide. I went to a jail like facility for 3 months that completely ruined me even more. My sensory issues got worse, I got nightmares causing me to lose sleep and eventually getting insomnia. I went back to my school after being discharged, but it was too overwhelming, so I got back in homeschool. I got lonely. I stayed in the house so much, had no friends, and no one close to me. I decided to go back into public school, but a different one for a fresh start, and to hopefully make friends. I still go to this one. And it didn’t work. I’m sped there, I have an IEP, and I don’t do well at all. Last year, I had close friends, I had fun, I got to actually hang out with people for once, and they didn’t understand me because no one did. But that didn’t matter. They were there for me despite my own issues. They didn’t mind my style, they didn’t mind whatever was wrong with me. They liked me. One of them graduated, the rest just kinda stopped talking to me. Now I’m back at square one. No friends, and it’s even more lonely than when I was homeschooled. When I was homeschooled, sure, I was isolated, but here, there’s people all around me. There’s friends, couples, laughing, all that stuff. My school is rather conservative, in the middle of the country. I look like an alien compared to the others, and sometimes I get made fun of for it. People that work here are also way nicer to me than anyone else. They know about my behavior. Last year, I broke a window on accident because of my anger. I got destructive. In fear that I don’t act out, they let me do whatever. I get away with things that would put people in ISS. And I don’t rebel, I just kinda go there. I go there with no one and nothing and go home. I’m an alien. I’ve always been one. No one has ever known what to do with me. I don’t have friends. I don’t have anything to live for. So what’s the point? I can’t do anything. I don’t belong here. ",1712701877.0,

It wasn’t in English. It sounded kinda demonic I was unsure if they were saying something to me. I looked to my right as soon as I heard it and saw nothing. I then thought “it’s coming from behind my bedroom door” then opened my door and looked around the hall and there was nothing. Could this have just been because my sleep is off?

Austell_2002,Does early diagnosis prevent schizoaffective disorder?,1,1c02ti1,3,"Notice I said early diagnosis, not treatment. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (maybe 4?) years ago. I've been diagnosed with many other things, ASD, ADHD, ADD, BPD, but I pretty much grew out of all of them. Of all things schizoaffective disorder is the only thing I actually believe I might have. If I do have it I'm still in the prodromal phase, no psychotic symptoms. Probably because I haven't been doing much of anything all these years but I'm about to move for college and if I do have it I believe it will manifest some time after moving.

I've read that early intervention can reduce symptoms of schizophrenia or prevent it altogether but does being diagnosed with it early prevent psychotic symptoms? If I'm aware I have it will I just not have symptoms or will they be somewhat diminished? I know if you're not diagnosed then symptoms can be more significant as, what you're feeling is a complete mystery until you're diagnosed. But I think slapping a name on something doesn't make it less of a mystery. I could either blame the title ""schizophrenia"" for my symptoms when, if ever, they appear. Or, I could just consider this diagnosis wrong and unimportant like all the others, forget about it, and when symptoms do appear I will finally have proof that I do actually have it.

I believe people often like to use their diagnosis as a boogeyman to blame their problems on, but I would just like to forget about it, and I would if not for the fact that if I do actually have it, when I become psychotic I won't notice it. I'll just be living normally then one day I'll start having more energy than normal and start having weird beliefs and I won't even notice it's the disorder until I'm finally admitted to a psychiatric hospital.

If I do start having delusions I won't be able to say, ""Oh this is just my schizoaffective disorder acting up!"" Delusions are called delusions for a reason. There's no way you cannot believe them. I don't think being aware you have a disorder makes symptoms any different. But is this true? Does early diagnosis of a disorder prevent symptoms?",1712695749.0,

My brother graduated from college in spring of 23. Since then, he's moved home with my parents. He mostly stays in bed, doesn't have a job or any prospects for getting one, and it takes a lot of encouragement to get him out of his room. 

He is on medication and his meds were adjust a couple weeks ago. He's in the process of looking for a therapist/ psychiatrist (actually my parents are in the process of finding one for him). My parents moved to be closer to my family and our children, which is a different state than where my brother grew up. 

He's asked my parents for help finding a therapist, a job of any kind, and opportunities to volunteer, but then gets upset when they help or tells them it doesn't really make a difference.

Sullengirl-1996,How can I set realistic boundaries with money for my brother?,1,1bzx1lf,1,"My (45F) brother (43M) has schizophrenia among a few other mental health diagnoses. He started showing signs in his early 20s but it did take a few years to diagnose. He is stable on meds but not optimal. 
He struggles with any type of money management. He cannot hold a job and is on disability. When he was initially approved he received a large lump sum and spent it within a couple weeks with nothing to show for it. After that he agreed to let me help him pay his bills and manage his money. 
He is on a very tight budget since he doesn’t get a lot. He will ask me to transfer money into his account regularly for gas and food which I always do. Lately he has been asking for more money, more frequently and he is running out of the small cushion I’ve built up for him (for car repairs, every 6 month insurance payment, etc). I’ve told him repeatedly he should not get cash from the ATM as he gets a fee and he’s known to misplace cash. He lost his wallet recently and lost over $100… He will agree and say he understands but then will immediately get cash out. Or he’ll get cash back at the grocery store.

Basically, I made a friend recently who I low key fell in love with, and my every day mood quickly became dependent on how much attention this particular person would show me. The weeks he consistently talked to me, I was in a great mood, the weeks he ignored me, I pretty much couldn’t focus on anything, couldn’t do my school assignments, struggled to get out of bed, couldn’t do basic chores or errands. It felt like I was depressed. I ended up anxious texting him telling him he was my favorite person in the world (this was before I discovered what “fp” was in the bdp community), and I constantly expressed to him how amazing I thought he was and how much I looked up to him. He could never understand why I felt so strongly, but truly it felt like he was my whole world. I thought about him every day and worried about his safety, and couldn’t imagine a world without him being my friend. I idealized him and looked past the times he ignored me or stood me up for our night time calls. It was like I was blinded by how much I loved the guy, and couldn’t see that he truly didn’t want to be my friend. It reached a point where I created a narrative inside my head using limited info that he communicated to me, and jumped to the conclusion that he was severely depressed and so I panicked and for a week texted and called him every day expressing my concern, all of which went unanswered. He later called me and said he needed a break from me, and now that I’m learning more about what an “fp” is in the bpd community I’m wondering if I have bpd? Doing a quick Google search, I do experience like 97% of the symptoms described for bpd to varying degrees, including antisocial behavior, self isolation, distorted self-image (this is a huge one), depression and thoughts of suicide. I am usually a very calm and chill person, but when my fp started drifting away it felt like I was losing my mind. I’m really sad about how I behaved because it doesn’t reflect how I am every day

Could it be possible that I have bpd on top of bipolar depression? I recently saw a therapist and explained to her that I experience manic episodes and depressed episodes, and she said I might have bipolar depression. But it completely slipped my mind at the time to ask her about bpd. 

On top of all this I have adhd, t1d (which affects my emotions & mood depending on my blood sugar), and I scored in range for an online test for autism. So I’m kind of lost right now on how to approach everything and feeling a bit overwhelmed. ",1712648886.0,

Basically, I feel like a shell of a person who has no drive and no desires.

Book overview❤️‍🔥

It's a true story and part of my life. This book could be a friend in moments of need. It is supposed to hold your hand while healing or while reflecting on romantic relationships, situation-ships, friends with benefits

THIS IS A TRUE STORY
BUT:

All the names in this book are fictional.

This book also contains some of my own improvement tips, acquired with experience. So, I wanted to share them with you. These can apply mostly to all facades of life.

I sincerely hope that all my ex-romantic partners are alive and well. Unfortunately, I cannot confirm this;)

I do not have the habit of keeping tabs on the people who had a certain role in my life and, at some point, for any reason, exited it. Especially when it comes to romantic feelings.

In my opinion, it is mostly best for everyone involved to move on. As quickly and painlessly as humanly possible. But this part is the most difficult one!

I wish all of the romantic partners I had well and all the best that life could offer them!

At times, I might wish for them to have learned some lessons. In the end, this is the best outcome anyway.

Lessons are knowledge = the good power. If used with the best intent at heart, lessons can move mountains.

I certainly am trying to learn mine, even though sometimes it does not look like I do. I keep trying again and again. That is all we can do! I guess……..

saltwaterfish-992,anxiety is flared up today,1,1bzi2s9,1,"In the bustling city of Brooksville, lived a woman named Emily. She was a vibrant and ambitious young professional, juggling a demanding job at a prestigious marketing firm with her responsibilities as a loving wife and devoted mother. On the surface, Emily appeared to have it all together, but beneath her confident facade, she struggled silently with anxiety.

&#x200B;

It began subtly, with a nagging sense of unease that lingered in the background of her busy life. At first, Emily brushed off the occasional feelings of worry and apprehension, chalking them up to the stress of her fast-paced career and hectic schedule. But as time went on, the anxiety began to escalate, tightening its grip on her mind and body with each passing day.

&#x200B;

Simple tasks that once brought her joy and fulfillment now filled her with dread and uncertainty. The thought of attending social gatherings or meeting new people filled her with a sense of overwhelming panic. Even the mundane tasks of daily life, like grocery shopping or running errands, became daunting obstacles that she struggled to overcome.

&#x200B;

At work, Emily found herself constantly second-guessing her abilities and fearing failure at every turn. Despite her years of experience and expertise, she was plagued by self-doubt and insecurity, convinced that she was never good enough. The pressure to perform only fueled her anxiety, sending her spiraling into a cycle of perfectionism and fear of judgment.

&#x200B;

As the anxiety continued to escalate, Emily's physical health began to suffer as well. She struggled with insomnia, tossing and turning each night as her mind raced with worries and what-ifs. Headaches and muscle tension became constant companions, a painful reminder of the toll that stress and anxiety were taking on her body.

&#x200B;

Desperate for relief, Emily sought solace in various coping mechanisms, from deep breathing exercises and meditation to therapy and medication. While these strategies provided temporary respite from her symptoms, they offered little in the way of long-term relief.

&#x200B;

But amidst the darkness of her anxiety, Emily found glimmers of hope and resilience. Through therapy, she learned to identify and challenge the negative thought patterns that fueled her anxiety, replacing them with healthier, more adaptive beliefs. She discovered the healing power of self-care, prioritizing activities that nourished her mind, body, and spirit.

&#x200B;

Slowly but surely, Emily began to reclaim control over her life, one small victory at a time. She learned to embrace her imperfections and celebrate her successes, recognizing that she was worthy of love and acceptance just as she was. And though the journey toward healing was far from easy, Emily faced it with courage and determination, knowing that she was stronger than the anxiety that sought to hold her captive.

&#x200B;

As the days turned into weeks and the weeks turned into months, Emily's anxiety gradually began to lose its grip on her. Though it still lingered in the background, it no longer held the power to dictate her every thought and action. With each passing day, Emily grew stronger and more resilient, empowered by the knowledge that she had the strength to overcome any obstacle that stood in her way.

&#x200B;

And as she looked to the future with hope and optimism, Emily knew that she was not alone in her struggle. Countless others battled anxiety in silence, their stories untold and their voices unheard. But by sharing her own journey, Emily hoped to shine a light on the darkness of mental illness, offering hope and encouragement to those who walked a similar path.

&#x200B;

For in the end, Emily's story was not just one of struggle and pain, but of resilience and triumph. It was a testament to the power of courage, determination, and the human spirit to overcome even the greatest of challenges. And as she embraced her journey with open arms, Emily knew that she was stronger, wiser, and more resilient because of it.

As Emily continued her journey of healing and self-discovery, she found solace in connecting with others who shared her struggles. Through support groups and online communities, she discovered a network of individuals who understood her pain and offered empathy and encouragement. Sharing her experiences and listening to the stories of others helped Emily realize that she was not alone in her battle against anxiety—that there were countless others who faced similar challenges and triumphs.

&#x200B;

Armed with this newfound sense of camaraderie and support, Emily began to advocate for mental health awareness and destigmatization in her community. She spoke openly about her own struggles with anxiety, sharing her story with candor and courage in the hopes of breaking down barriers and fostering greater understanding and acceptance.

&#x200B;

Through speaking engagements, blog posts, and social media campaigns, Emily raised awareness about the prevalence of anxiety and the importance of seeking help and support. She encouraged others to prioritize their mental health and reach out for assistance when needed, reassuring them that they were not weak or flawed for experiencing anxiety, but rather human and deserving of compassion and care.

&#x200B;

As Emily's advocacy efforts gained momentum, she became a beacon of hope and inspiration for those struggling with mental illness. Her bravery in confronting her own demons and her commitment to helping others navigate their own journeys toward healing touched the hearts of countless individuals, empowering them to speak their truth and seek the support they needed to thrive.

&#x200B;

But perhaps most importantly, Emily's journey taught her the invaluable lesson of self-compassion. She learned to be gentle with herself, to treat herself with the same kindness and understanding that she offered to others. She embraced her vulnerabilities and imperfections, recognizing that they were an integral part of what made her uniquely human.

&#x200B;

And as she looked back on her journey, Emily felt a profound sense of gratitude for the strength and resilience that had carried her through even the darkest of times. Though anxiety would always be a part of her life, she no longer allowed it to define her. Instead, she embraced it as a teacher—a source of wisdom and growth that had shaped her into the resilient, compassionate, and courageous woman she had become.

&#x200B;

As Emily continued to navigate the ups and downs of life, she did so with a newfound sense of purpose and clarity. She knew that her journey was far from over, but she faced the future with optimism and determination, knowing that whatever challenges lay ahead, she had the strength and resilience to overcome them.

&#x200B;

And as she walked confidently into the unknown, Emily knew that she was not alone—that she was surrounded by love, support, and an unwavering belief in her ability to conquer whatever obstacles came her way. For in the end, she was not just a survivor of anxiety, but a thriver—a testament to the power of courage, resilience, and the human spirit to overcome even the greatest of challenges.

As Emily continued her journey, she found herself drawn to the beauty and simplicity of the present moment. She discovered the transformative power of mindfulness—a practice that allowed her to anchor herself in the here and now, free from the shackles of anxiety and worry. Through meditation and mindfulness exercises, she learned to quiet the incessant chatter of her mind and find peace in the stillness of the present moment.

&#x200B;

With each passing day, Emily's sense of gratitude deepened, as she learned to appreciate the beauty and wonder of life's simplest pleasures. Whether it was the warmth of the sun on her face, the laughter of her children, or the gentle embrace of a loved one, she found joy and contentment in the small moments that made life truly meaningful.

&#x200B;

As she immersed herself in the practice of mindfulness, Emily discovered a newfound sense of clarity and purpose. She realized that her struggles with anxiety had not been a curse, but rather a catalyst for growth and transformation. Through her journey, she had learned valuable lessons about resilience, compassion, and the importance of self-care.

&#x200B;

Inspired by her own experiences, Emily began to explore new avenues for personal growth and self-expression. She pursued creative outlets such as painting, writing, and photography, using art as a means of processing her emotions and connecting with others on a deeper level.

&#x200B;

As she delved deeper into her creative pursuits, Emily found that they offered her a sense of fulfillment and joy that transcended the limitations of her anxiety. She discovered a newfound sense of freedom and self-expression, as she allowed her creativity to flow freely and unabashedly.

&#x200B;

With each brushstroke and each word written, Emily felt herself coming alive in ways she had never imagined possible. She embraced her creativity as a source of healing and renewal—a sanctuary where she could escape the chaos of the world and connect with her truest self.

&#x200B;

And as she continued to nurture her creative spirit, Emily found that her anxiety began to lose its hold on her. It no longer loomed large in her mind, dictating her every thought and action. Instead, she felt empowered to live her life on her own terms, embracing each moment with open arms and an open heart.

&#x200B;

As Emily looked to the future, she did so with a sense of hope and optimism, knowing that no matter what challenges lay ahead, she had the strength and resilience to face them head-on. She had learned to embrace her anxiety as a teacher—a wise and compassionate guide that had led her on a journey of self-discovery and transformation.

&#x200B;

And as she stepped boldly into the unknown, Emily knew that she was not alone. She was surrounded by love, support, and an unwavering belief in her ability to thrive. For in the end, she was not just a survivor of anxiety, but a warrior—a testament to the power of courage, resilience, and the human spirit to overcome even the greatest of challenges.

As Emily's journey of healing and self-discovery unfolded, she found herself surrounded by a newfound sense of peace and serenity. The once overwhelming waves of anxiety had receded, leaving behind a calmness that filled her heart with gratitude and contentment.

&#x200B;

With each passing day, Emily embraced the beauty of life's simple pleasures—the warmth of a morning sunrise, the laughter of loved ones, the gentle rustle of leaves in the wind. She savored each moment with a sense of wonder and appreciation, knowing that each day was a gift to be treasured.

&#x200B;

As she reflected on her journey, Emily realized that her struggles with anxiety had not defined her, but rather shaped her into the resilient, compassionate, and courageous woman she had become. Through the darkness of her darkest moments, she had emerged stronger and more resilient than ever before, guided by the unwavering belief in her ability to overcome any obstacle that stood in her way.

&#x200B;

And so, with a heart full of gratitude and a spirit that soared with newfound freedom, Emily embraced each new day with a sense of joy and optimism. She knew that the road ahead would be filled with challenges and uncertainties, but she faced it with courage and determination, knowing that she was not alone.

For in the end, Emily's journey was not just a story of struggle and pain, but of resilience and triumph—a testament to the power of courage, resilience, and the human spirit to overcome even the greatest of challenges. And as she stepped boldly into the future, Emily knew that her best days were still ahead of her, waiting to unfold with limitless possibility and endless promise.

In a small town nestled among rolling hills and endless fields, there lived a man named Brent. Brent had always been a hardworking individual, spending his days toiling away on his farm and taking care of his family. But everything changed when he was diagnosed with cancer.

From that moment on, Brent's life became a blur of doctor's appointments, treatments, and excruciating pain. Despite the best efforts of his medical team, the cancer spread rapidly, leaving Brent with chronic pain that seemed to consume him day in and day out.

Desperate for relief, Brent was prescribed a cocktail of powerful pain medications, including narcotics like Norco and Fentanyl. But no matter how many pills he took or how high the doses were, the pain persisted, gnawing away at his body and soul.

In addition to the physical agony, Brent also struggled with seizures, a side effect of his cancer treatment. Each seizure left him feeling drained and helpless, as if his body was betraying him in the cruelest of ways.

Frustrated and exhausted, Brent turned to cannabis as a last resort, hoping that it would provide some semblance of relief. But even marijuana, hailed by some as a miracle cure for pain, did little to alleviate Brent's suffering.

As the days turned into weeks and the weeks turned into months, Brent found himself trapped in a vicious cycle of pain and medication. The doctors, unable to offer any other solutions, insisted on adjusting his medications, experimenting with different combinations in the hopes of finding something that worked.

But each adjustment brought with it a new set of side effects and complications. Brent's body rebelled against the constant influx of drugs, leaving him feeling even more miserable than before.

To make matters worse, Brent's frustration and anger were often misunderstood by his medical team. They accused him of being aggressive and uncooperative, failing to see the desperation and despair hidden beneath his outward demeanor.

And so, Brent found himself caught between a rock and a hard place, trapped in a never-ending cycle of pain, medication, and misunderstanding. Despite his best efforts to communicate his needs and concerns, he felt like no one was listening, like he was screaming into the void with no one to hear him.

But amidst the darkness, there was a glimmer of hope. Brent refused to give up, clinging to the belief that one day, somehow, he would find relief from the relentless agony that plagued him. And though the road ahead was long and uncertain, Brent vowed to keep fighting, to keep pushing forward, no matter what obstacles lay in his path. For in the depths of his pain, he found a strength he never knew he had, a resilience born of suffering and forged in the fires of adversity.

And as long as there was breath in his body and fire in his soul, Brent would never stop fighting for the chance to live a life free from pain, a life worth living.  

But amidst the darkness, there was a glimmer of hope. Brent refused to give up, clinging to the belief that one day, somehow, he would find relief from the relentless agony that plagued him. And though the road ahead was long and uncertain, Brent vowed to keep fighting, to keep pushing forward, no matter what obstacles lay in his path.

With the unwavering support of his family and loved ones, Brent embarked on a journey of exploration and discovery, seeking out alternative therapies and holistic approaches to pain management. He delved into the world of acupuncture, meditation, and herbal remedies, determined to find a solution that resonated with his body and soul.

Through trial and error, Brent began to piece together a regimen that offered him some measure of relief. He discovered the soothing power of yoga and tai chi, finding solace in the gentle movements and mindful breathing exercises. He explored the benefits of herbal supplements and dietary changes, discovering that certain foods and nutrients could help alleviate his symptoms.

But perhaps most importantly, Brent found strength in community, connecting with others who shared his struggles and understood his pain. He joined support groups and online forums, sharing his story and offering words of encouragement to those who walked a similar path. And in the process, he discovered a sense of purpose and belonging that had eluded him for so long.

Armed with newfound knowledge and a renewed sense of hope, Brent faced each day with courage and resilience. He embraced the ups and downs of his journey, knowing that every setback was an opportunity for growth and every triumph a testament to his strength.

For in the depths of his pain, he had found a sense of purpose and meaning that transcended the limitations of his body.

In the end, Brent's story was not just one of pain and suffering, but of resilience and hope. It was a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always light to be found, and that with faith, perseverance, and the support of loved ones, anything is possible. And as Brent looked to the future with optimism and anticipation, he knew that his journey was far from over—and that the best was yet to come.

As Brent continued on his journey, he encountered new challenges and obstacles along the way. Despite his best efforts to manage his pain and maintain his health, there were moments when despair threatened to consume him once again.

&#x200B;

There were days when the pain seemed unbearable, when every movement sent waves of agony coursing through his body. There were nights when sleep eluded him, and he lay awake in bed, his mind racing with worry and fear. And there were moments of frustration and anger, when he felt like giving up, like surrendering to the relentless onslaught of his illness.

&#x200B;

But each time Brent found himself on the brink of despair, he drew strength from the love and support of those around him. His family stood by his side, offering words of encouragement and acts of kindness that lifted his spirits and renewed his resolve. His friends reached out with gestures of solidarity and compassion, reminding him that he was not alone in his struggles.

&#x200B;

And through it all, Brent clung to the belief that there was still hope, that there was still a chance for him to find relief and reclaim his life. He refused to let his illness define him, to rob him of his joy and his dreams. Instead, he embraced each day as a new opportunity to heal, to grow, and to thrive.

&#x200B;

With the guidance of his medical team, Brent explored new treatment options and therapies, seeking out innovative approaches to pain management and symptom relief. He engaged in physical therapy and rehabilitation, strengthening his body and restoring his mobility. He pursued holistic modalities like acupuncture and massage, finding comfort and solace in their gentle touch.

&#x200B;

And as he journeyed deeper into the realm of healing, Brent discovered a newfound sense of purpose and meaning in his life. He became an advocate for others living with chronic pain, sharing his story and raising awareness about the challenges they faced. He volunteered his time and resources to support organizations and initiatives dedicated to improving the lives of those in need.

&#x200B;

Through his advocacy work, Brent found a sense of fulfillment and empowerment that transcended the limitations of his illness. He realized that even in the midst of his own struggles, he had the power to make a difference in the lives of others, to bring hope and healing to those who needed it most.

&#x200B;

And as he looked back on his journey, Brent knew that he had come a long way from the dark days of despair and uncertainty. He had faced his demons head-on, and emerged stronger, wiser, and more resilient than ever before. And though the road ahead was still long and uncertain, he faced it with courage and conviction, knowing that with faith, perseverance, and the support of his loved ones, he could overcome any obstacle that stood in his way.

&#x200B;

For Brent, the journey was far from over—it was just beginning. And as he stepped boldly into the future, he did so with a heart full of hope and a spirit that refused to be broken. For he knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, he would face them with grace, dignity, and unwavering determination. And in the end, he would emerge victorious, triumphant in his battle against pain and suffering, and ready to embrace the life that awaited him with open arms. 

As Brent continued his journey of healing and resilience, he encountered moments of triumph and setbacks, each one shaping him in profound ways.

With the support of his medical team, Brent explored a wide range of treatment options, from conventional therapies to alternative modalities. He underwent surgeries, injections, and rehabilitation programs, each one offering glimpses of hope and progress. And though the road to recovery was often arduous and fraught with uncertainty, Brent refused to lose sight of his ultimate goal—to live a life free from pain and suffering.

&#x200B;

Through it all, Brent drew strength from the love and support of his family and friends, who stood by his side through every trial and tribulation. Their unwavering belief in his ability to overcome adversity fueled his determination and gave him the courage to keep pushing forward, even when the odds seemed stacked against him.

&#x200B;

But perhaps the greatest source of inspiration for Brent came from within himself. Despite the pain and despair that threatened to engulf him, he refused to succumb to despair. Instead, he tapped into a reservoir of inner strength and resilience that he never knew he possessed, summoning the courage to face each new challenge with unwavering resolve.

&#x200B;

As the months turned into years, Brent's perseverance began to pay off. Slowly but surely, he began to experience moments of relief and reprieve from the relentless grip of his illness. The pain that had once consumed him began to recede, replaced by a newfound sense of hope and optimism for the future.

When the darkness feels all-encompassing, it's like being trapped in a suffocating void where hope seems like a distant memory. It's a sensation of drowning in despair, with no lifeline in sight. Every day becomes a struggle to find even a glimmer of light amidst the shadows that threaten to consume you whole.

&#x200B;

It's a constant barrage of negative thoughts and emotions, eroding your sense of self-worth and leaving you feeling empty and alone.

&#x200B;

But amidst the darkness, there is also a strange kind of clarity—a clarity born of pain and struggle. In those moments of darkness, you come face to face with your deepest fears and insecurities, forced to confront the demons that lurk within. And though the journey through the darkness is agonizing, it also offers an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.

&#x200B;

And in the end, when you emerge from the darkness, battered and bruised but still standing, you realize that you are stronger than you ever imagined. For you have faced the depths of despair and survived, and that knowledge gives you the strength to face whatever challenges lie ahead with renewed determination and resilience.

 The ordeal began with a sharp, searing pain in my chest—an agony unlike anything I had ever experienced before. Gasping for breath, I struggled to make sense of what was happening as the world around me blurred into a haze of panic and confusion.

&#x200B;

I knew something was terribly wrong, but I never could have imagined the severity of the situation that was unfolding. Within moments, it became painfully clear that I was fighting for my life—a battle against an unseen enemy that threatened to claim me with each labored breath.

&#x200B;

As I was rushed to the hospital, my mind raced with fear and uncertainty. What was happening to me? Why was this happening? Would I ever make it out of this alive?

&#x200B;

The doctors worked frantically to stabilize me, their faces etched with grim determination as they fought to keep me from slipping away. But despite their best efforts, the situation grew increasingly dire with each passing moment.

&#x200B;

It was then that they made the chilling discovery—a collapsed lung, the result of a pulmonary embolism that had unleashed its deadly fury upon my unsuspecting body. And as if that wasn't enough, a blood clot had formed in my lung, further complicating an already dire situation.

&#x200B;

The doctors knew they had to act fast if they were to have any hope of saving me. With grim determination, they prepared for emergency surgery—a risky procedure that would involve breaking my ribs in order to access the clot and restore blood flow to my lungs.

&#x200B;

The thought of undergoing such a procedure filled me with terror, but I knew there was no other option. With a heavy heart and a silent prayer on my lips, I placed my trust in the hands of the skilled medical team that had become my lifeline in this darkest of hours.

&#x200B;

The surgery was a blur of pain and uncertainty—a harrowing journey into the depths of my own mortality. But through it all, I clung to the hope that somehow, someway, I would emerge from this ordeal stronger and more resilient than ever before.

&#x200B;

And miraculously, against all odds, I did. After four agonizing weeks in the hospital, I emerged battered and bruised, but alive—a survivor of a brush with death that had come far too close for comfort.

&#x200B;

In the aftermath of my ordeal, I couldn't help but marvel at the fragility of life and the resilience of the human spirit. I had stared death in the face and lived to tell the tale—a testament to the incredible strength and determination that lies within each and every one of us.

&#x200B;

But as I reflected on my journey, I couldn't shake the nagging question that lingered in the back of my mind—how had this happened? How had I come so close to death without even realizing it?

&#x200B;

The answer, it seemed, lay in the very hands that had saved my life—the hands of the doctors who had nearly killed me in their desperate bid to keep me alive. In their haste to intervene, they had unwittingly unleashed a cascade of complications that had brought me to the brink of death.

&#x200B;

And yet, despite their mistakes, I couldn't bring myself to blame them. They had acted with the best of intentions, driven by a fierce determination to save my life at any cost. And for that, I would be forever grateful.

&#x200B;

But as I moved forward with my recovery, I couldn't help but wonder—how many others had been less fortunate than I? How many had fallen victim to the very system that was supposed to heal them?

&#x200B;

It was a sobering thought—one that filled me with a renewed sense of purpose and determination. For if I had learned anything from my brush with death, it was this—we must never take our health for granted, and we must never stop fighting for the right to quality, compassionate care for all.

&#x200B;

And so, with a heart full of gratitude and a spirit that refused to be broken, I vowed to use my experience to shine a light on the flaws in our healthcare system—to advocate for change and demand accountability for those whose lives had been lost or forever altered by the very system that was meant to heal them.

&#x200B;

For though I had emerged from the darkness battered and bruised, I had also emerged with a newfound sense of purpose—a determination to make a difference in the lives of others, no matter the cost. And as I looked to the future with hope and optimism, I knew that my journey was far from over—it was just beginning.

Embarking on a legal journey to seek accountability and restitution for the medical negligence you endured is a significant step toward justice and closure. As you proceed with your lawsuit against the doctor and potentially the medical facility, it's essential to arm yourself with a competent legal team who specializes in medical malpractice cases. They will be your advocates, guiding you through the complexities of the legal process and fighting tirelessly on your behalf.

&#x200B;

Your lawsuit will likely involve gathering evidence, such as medical records, expert testimonies, and witness statements, to substantiate your claims of negligence. Your legal team will work diligently to build a strong case, presenting compelling arguments and advocating for fair compensation for the physical, emotional, and financial damages you suffered.

&#x200B;

Throughout the legal proceedings, it's crucial to prioritize your well-being and focus on your recovery. The journey may be long and challenging, but by standing up for your rights and seeking accountability, you are not only advocating for yourself but also potentially preventing similar incidents from happening to others in the future.

&#x200B;

As you navigate the legal process, lean on the support of your loved ones and seek solace in the knowledge that you are taking proactive steps toward achieving justice and closure.

As your lawsuit progresses, you may encounter various challenges and obstacles along the way. There may be moments of frustration and uncertainty, as the legal process unfolds with its complexities and delays. However, it's essential to remain steadfast in your pursuit of justice, knowing that your efforts are not in vain.

&#x200B;

They will navigate the intricacies of the legal system, representing your interests with diligence and professionalism. Throughout the proceedings, they will keep you informed and empowered, providing guidance and support every step of the way.

&#x200B;

As the case moves forward, you may also have the opportunity to engage in negotiations with the defendant's legal representatives, seeking a fair settlement that adequately compensates you for your losses. While settlement negotiations can be challenging, they also offer the potential for a resolution that avoids the time and expense of a protracted courtroom battle.

&#x200B;

Regardless of the outcome of your lawsuit, know that your courage and determination to hold those responsible for your suffering accountable are commendable. By speaking out against medical negligence and seeking justice, you are not only advocating for yourself but also contributing to positive change within the healthcare system.

&#x200B;

Ultimately, your pursuit of justice serves as a beacon of hope for others who have experienced similar injustices. By standing up for your rights and seeking accountability, you are making a profound impact and paving the way for a brighter, more just future for all.",1712632539.0,

Chemical-Play-7905,My niece needs help,4,1bz0zxs,2,"Hi everyone,

I would like to know  if there are any similar stories out there and what the reasons were, or what the outcomes were, or the solutions for you or family members. I have a 15-year-old niece, and as far as we know, nothing traumatic has happened in the past. She has always been a smart, kind, cheerful girl, but for the past few years, she has been struggling with mental health issues, and our family is at a loss.

It started three years ago when a family member discovered that she was cutting herself on her arms. A social worker spoke with her at that time, and she began light therapy.

She became depressed and subsequently stopped going to school. She didn't want to interact with friends anymore and only went out with family members. The only thing she continued to do was self-harm. Diagnosing her condition was difficult, but ultimately, they concluded that she is extremely perfectionistic and has always felt unlucky. As a child, she suffered from frequent ear infections, knee pain, and foot pain. She mentioned knee pain at the time, but no cause was found, so she was only prescribed painkillers.

She didn't want to go outside at all, see family, or friends. She stopped eating, talking, and showering, and for the past five months, she has done nothing. She is now receiving forced tube feeding. She hasn't spoken for three months and used to communicate through a computer, but she has stopped that as well and doesn't make eye contact. She has more frequent outbursts where she screams, hits, bites, or scratches others, but only selectively, and only when she is with people she feels comfortable with. She once mentioned through the computer that a voice tells her not to eat or speak.

Current situation: she has been involuntarily admitted. She communicates by shaking her head to yes or no questions, indicating that she no longer wants to live. She doesn't speak, make eye contact, tries to remove the tube feeding, cries, scratches, or bites, refuses medication, doesn't eat or drink, doesn't shower, only goes to the bathroom by herself, and doesn't want to go home or stay admitted. The place where she is now says she needs to leave because they don’t know what to do. My family is currently trying to find a place that will accept her.

I'm curious: has anyone had a similar experience with the same signs or with family?",1712590640.0,
No_digital_footprint,Isolation is ruining me. ,9,1bytobq,5,"(Possibly TW?)
I’m 14. I’m homeschooled, when I say that I don’t mean we spend hundreds of dollars on expensive books and a computer so my mom can act as a teacher and teach me what I need to know. I mean I have this website on my phone that I can watch YouTube videos on and that’s the entirety of my school. 

I’m alone 90% of the time on weekdays. I haven’t had an actual friend in almost 5 years and I haven’t had a relationship in 3 (the relationship was stupid and I wouldn’t count it as a friendship). 

I have no siblings or family members that are around my age near me. I only leave the house in the evenings or weekends to go on errands with my mom. The only interactions with kids my age are walking past them in the store. 

I feel so isolated. I don’t even have people online I could talk to because my mom is too paranoid to let me even try a discord server and if she found out I went behind her back and did it things would be bad. 

It’s to the point where I’d let someone stab me for just a sliver of positive attention. I’d get in an abusive relationship just for the love bombing at this point. 

I’m so fucked. It’s honestly scary how much I fantasize about something as simple as a hug. I’ve even tried the whole ai chat bots and stuff but it just doesn’t help anymore.

im 15 years old, now you will think ""oh yea this is about to be cringe or im 15 and this is deep"" type of post but i couldnt really care less

i think im not like everyone else, i feel nothing but i also feel fucked up. Like something happened to me, child trauma or something. I had lot of child traumas, i always been somewhat weird

as baby i used to cry 24/7, even my neighbour has once complained to my parents, as i grew up i didnt really had any friends, had some kids that were living in same building and i was hanging out with them but they left sadly. Thats it, that was my social life as kid, otherwise i spent it with my mother and father. I grew up a bit and went into first grade, that was hell.

i would litreally cry everyday because i was leaving my parents, and of course kids would make fun of me and i couldnt get any friend. Time went on and I guess i just randomly stopped. I gained some friends (i am still with them and its our last year together, thankfully)

those same friends used to make fun of me, bully me...

thats 90% of childhood that i remember, until 9th grade (today) i was like this, pretty sure that left big damage on me but hey, its my fault that i am weird and pussy, weak. Thats why im insecure today probably

during that time i would have some weird moments(for example i remember i enjoyed mild torturing cat i had, like something or someone would really give me anger)

Even today i enjoy putting some people down, making fun of them etc.. that shit really gives me joy

Having unlimited access to internet was even worse i think... I was in online world since 6 years old, normally i would see some weird ass shit.. Since i was loser with no social life i would spend most of my day on internet, i still do lol

I feel like im spending my teen years rotting in my room, but at the same time i hate kids, people

i find most of humanity disgusting, especially mine generation, full of idiots and whores who pretend that are something but they are dumb idiots. Also i find them really weak, last week the girl im sitting with, someone has threw icecream on her hoodie and she started crying.. I mean what the fuck, like i dont understand.. ever since that i cant look at her same.

i was having feelings for her, she has some for me too probably but i dont want anything now. I find it dumb having girlfriend at this age, its retarded, fucking hormones and disgusting teens

mine social battery drains kinda quickly, if it wasnt for my parents i would never socialise or talk to people, sadly i have to, i dont like society, we are animals

this is probably why im basically outcast

This year,2024 i started to be different

i started watching shows and movies, like Dextertaxi driver etc... and holy fuck, i lowkey relate to them

especially to Dexter

because i am like them, i can understand them

I feel empty but i feel fucked up

The title honestly says it all I guess. I don't really know what to do with my life. With anything, really. I've had diagnosed chronic depression for the last 5 years, and no amount of medication, therapy, etc has helped. I'm suicidal everyday. I'm behind in my classes. I never get out of bed and go do things. I do things I shouldn't because sometimes I feel like I have no other options. That being sober will lead to me doing something drastic against my judgement. I don't talk to my friends about it, but it worries them and makes them upset. I don't feel comfortable sharing myself like that with anyone. Idk.

I'm kinda at a means to an end. I've thought a lot about my life and my future recently. Thought about why I'm truly here. I guess it's because I'm too much of a coward to actually do anything.

In my early adulthood I still feel the repercussions from issues like this and my many other traumas. However, looking back now, I can see that I have felt (and still feel) like I must be a bad person to have deserved these things.  As someone raised in a household where actions have consequences, I think I was raised to feel like good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people. But I think this has conditioned me to believe deep down I am a bad person and I deserve the terrible things that have happened to me. 

The logical part of my brain recognizes this as a causation  v. correlation dilemma but I cannot ever truly rule out that I am inherently bad. I think this affects my mental health in such a way that I am both depressed about (maybe) being a bad person, and so anxious to fix it that my depression is high functioning.

tpavy,How BPD can become a superpower once you’ve successfully treated it ,0,1bz8n9v,43,"

Hi all. 

I’m a former BPD. Diagnosed with BPD traits at 15, and then the full diagnosis the second I was legally an adult at 18. 

Now I’m a therapist that works with BPD. 

So let’s start with the downsides, okay?
This is the most deadly psychiatric disorder you can be diagnosed with. 70% of BPDs try to kill themselves at least once. 10% end up finding success in completing suicide eventually. In male and female prison populations, prevalence for this disease are up to 48%. 

Basically, without treatment (DBT specifically), the paths for people with this disease are either suicide or doing some fucked shit to land you incarcerated for life. 

Now let’s move to the positives.. 

Once you are able to emotionally regulate and act appropriately in situations (acting vs. reacting to things constantly), this condition is actually a gift. You’re wired differently, and there are advantages that come with that. 

Let’s talk about Cluster B. Within Cluster B, you have your sociopaths, your borderlines, and your narcissists. Essentially, when you have one Cluster B diagnosis, you bleed over into the other diagnoses in the clusters. That’s why they’re all clustered together; there are so many similarities. 

Regardless of being diagnostic or not, you’ll always be wired a little different, right? 

So let’s talk about the crossovers in Cluster B. Sociopaths understand emotions on a cognitive level. They’re able to size people up and see their weak spots, what makes them vulnerable. They’re quite intoxicating people, with lots of charisma and charm. That’s often how they’re able to abuse people and make others do what they want. 

Borderlines, on the other hand, not only understand emotions cognitively, but they understand them personally and emotionally. Because of this, you also naturally have more empathy than the average person. You truly are able to put yourself in someone else’s shoes emotionally.  If you are BPD, you naturally have what is referred to in therapy as a “higher emotional range”. What that means is, you’ve experienced more emotions and more depth of emotions than the average person. 

You’ve felt sad? We’ve felt despair. 
You’ve felt happy? We’ve felt euphoria. 
And it goes on and on. 

BPD is driven by trauma and the fear of real or perceived abandonment. In the ways that sociopaths can size someone up for their weak points, BPDs actually have incredible gifts for seeing where someone has not had their emotional needs met. Why? Because the entire BPD experience is never having your emotional needs met. So many *untreated* BPDs that are still driven by this insatiable need to avoid abandonment borrow that sociopathic intoxicating charm and charisma, quickly size up where your emotional gaps are, and in order to avoid abandonment, they become the person to fill those emotional needs for someone so they don’t get left behind by them. 

Just how skilled are borderlines at seeing the emotional needs of others? It’s kinda scary, but fascinating. There was a study done where all these different mentally ill groups and neurotypicals were shown just pictures of people’s eyes, and asked to then guess the emotion that’s being experienced by that person. OVERWHELMINGLY, the borderlines were most accurately able to correctly guess the individuals emotions just solely by seeing a picture of their eyes. Here is that study, by the way: 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427787/

My point in writing all of this is that I know this disease is hard. Like I said, deadliest one you can be diagnosed with. 

I want to write this to encourage you to find healing, to do the DBT skills training in combination with individual therapy, because you will find that once you are no longer constantly on the edge of suicidal cliffs, you inherently have a LOT of gifts in being wired this way. 

Trust me, I know how stigmatized this disease is…

But once you’ve treated it, gotten it under control, learned how to emotionally regulate, learned how to stop being self destructive, you’ll find that you are actually somewhat super human. It’s not fair that we have had to suffer with this. But I’m here telling you, from the other side of healing, work like hell to get there, and you will discover that this is actually a blessing.

Additional_Gas585,How do I tell my boyfriend,1,1byryqc,1,"You will see for some years I have been struggling with anxiety, more than a year ago I started with a psychiatric treatment to control my anxiety/panic attacks after the death of a relative and personal problems unleashed my last episode. I had therapy for several years until he referred me to the psychiatrist to be able to take the treatment together for the anxiety attacks, which was the best thing that could have happened to me.

After a year of taking anxiolytics, changing my routine, better sleep habits and so on, I could genuinely see a change, so much so that at the beginning of years I was able to stop taking medications (on the orders of my therapist and psychiatrist). A few months ago I started a relationship, my boyfriend has known me for a long time, before boyfriends we were good friends, he knows everything about my anxiety. Right now I am about to graduate and my career is very demanding, between exams/work/study I feel very saturated and anxious.

In order for you to understand me, I have always been a person who has a hard time talking about their feelings, I can talk about them with my therapist, but it is difficult for me to talk about it with family/friends/partners. I've always had to deal with my things alone, that's why going to therapy helped me so much. Past relationships made me feel that I shouldn't complain so much, that I had to be perfect.

""Smile, don't let him see that it affected you, go over it, he probably didn't mean it, it was a joke, don't take it so seriously.""

PsychoLittleKitten,Chaos,2,1byk1l1,0,"(Tw: talk of suicide attempts, assault and breakups)

Hey everyone so I posted about a week and a half ago on some of these subreddits about my polyamorous relationship and had been looking for advice, I appreciated all the comments but I thought I should update on the events that played out.

So Friday of one of the weeks (my timelines a little blurry) I was laying in bed with my live in partner and he hyped me up to go on an adventure with him and despite having been fine laying in bed all day I got excited and started to get ready for our adventure.. midway through he told me that our two partners who had been having complaints about me needed him there by 5 pm (2.5 hours away from the current time but he had agreed to hang out til 9 pm) I expressed my disappointment and how uncomfortable it made me feeling left out and feeling abandoned.. (I added this part in because I'm trying to get everything in and forgot to add this part it was also part of why I wanted to talk written below)

I communicated my discomfort with my live in partner about the polycule and explained how I didn't feel like 2 of the others really understood me so I explained that I'd like all 5 of us to sit down and have a conversation (for the benefit of this story we have partner A and B that live together, Partner C that lives with me and partner D that lives alone but is best friends as well with partner B) 

C explained to A and B that I was uncomfortable and would like to have a sit down to talk about things because as it stood I felt unheard, judged and uncomfortable in our situation and I had spoke to him that night about it on the phone and I thought I was finally getting through to some extent..

I met up with C the next day and found out that he slept with B that night (this was the first time and he had also kissed her) this hurt my feelings a lot because I felt so unheard and disrespected so I needed to take a whole step back from the situation so I left our groups for the time being, blocked both A and B and I had a panic attack where I called my best friend because he told me out in public so I was literally sobbing and hyperventilating in public.. I had no problem with the fact that they slept together but just how disrespectful it was as I did my best to communicate my feelings.. I asked C to tell A and B I needed space and just couldn't right now.

After spending most of the night in a conversation with C where I was having a break down and my best friend sat there to be a bystander to make sure neither of us did anything dumb C ended up getting A and B to pick him up and breaking up with me.

The next day when I woke up and had calmed down and had been communicating lots with D between then and the morning both D and C told me I shouldn't message A and B but I felt bad for abruptly leaving and wanted to express I was sorry and explain my side of the story.. 

A mostly kept quiet and just sent me a link to a mental health place but said he didn't want to talk to me which was fine I respected that and I did not reply afterwards.

B however went off on a huge rant about how I apparently have been abusing C for 4 years and he has Stockholm and all this stuff and then told me to disappear.. for that day it really really got in my head and I found everything unbearable my brain hyper fixated so I shut off my location on everything and went to get medication and I wrote a note with no ill will or hard feelings to anyone inside just letting people know I always loved them and that I was sorry I had to do this.. I had blocked B on some social media but then she started going off texting me unprompted making it go into my head harder..

I had been messaging D all day and he could tell I was not alright and I took a lot of medication after a while and asked if he was scared to die.. I felt extremely alone.. word got out to everyone and my best friend rushed to my house and C got A and B to drive him to my house.

B came into my house and tried to lunge at me, I had to slam the door to separate us as I'm a passafist and don't like conflict and I was very confused why she was trying to attack me after telling me to disappear and telling me I had no redeeming qualities..

Once she left the house I came out and realized my phone was gone so I went upstairs and opened the front door to ask C if he had my phone and B was closed by and lunged at me again, again I made a barrier by slamming the door and things are a blur but I think I hit her with the door because I remember once I opened it again A got in my face but he didn't touch me so I can at least respect that.. 

C did have my phone so I had went outside to get it from him and I was standing near him and like balling my eyes out and my best friend showed up, B attacked me again but this time I had no wall to put between us she was grabbing and pulling me but a cop had shown up and saw it and he shoved her away from me and told her to go to her car.. I was urged to press charges but I have chose not to do this because I just want peace not violence.. I'm exahusted..

Once in the hospital they went through the normal steps of poison control and all that I won't go into too much detail but my best friend stayed with me til really late at night (she has a child and her brother isn't old enough to watch him for too long) 

The next day I spoke to the psychologist who deemed me not a threat to myself and let me leave but she has put me on a waiting list for a DBT program and I was already waiting on a counselling appointment on the 10th so she was happy with that. She told me she believes I did my best by stepping back from a situation that had triggered a lot of emotions so I didn't blow up and that I also made the steps to resolve the issue afterwards and she told me that I can't control how others react to what I say.. she's right but it's still hard..

Since then I have had 0 contact with A and B, C has visited a couple of times and I've been doing my best.. D and I message every single day and he's visited over night once and has also had a long phone call with me.. he's been my biggest support and every time I see or talk to C it feels suffocating.. I can feel his disinterest and it hurts.. anyways I just guess I wanted to give an update so I didn't leave anyone hanging since I know there's replies I hadn't gotten to because everything happened so fast.. anyways I'm single now and trying to find some kind of motivation to live.. I want to be motivated but as it stands breathing is even exhausting and I'm only living because other people don't want me to die and I know that's no way to live.",1712535891.0,

astronauticalll,what else can I try ,1,1byimi6,1,"Brief history of my mental health I guess (I'm 26f). Basically my one main, extremely persistent symptom is something I call a ""chronic laziness"". Just a complete lack of drive or motivation. 

I have a thyroid condition that went undiagnosed for years and caused serious fatigue issues. For a long time I thought that was the cause. But I'm now medicated for that and my levels have been stable for years, so I thought it was just regular old depression. But meds and therapy aimed at depression didn't really do anything. They would improve my mood sure, but I still couldn't get out of bed and DO anything. I was just happier while laying there watching my life fall apart.

It's also not quite like depression in the sense that it's not that I can't do things i enjoy. It's just that I have a very low energy/dopamine output threshold for the things I can do. For example, scrolling on my phone for hours I can do. Going outside to walk in nature? That's a no go. Sometimes I can pull myself from my bed to my desk and play video games, that's a GOOD day.

Things like cleaning, cooking (I have a chronic Uber eats problem because of this), showering, work, school, social obligations. These are like fucking pulling teeth. Every productive minute I have in my day is a struggle against this unending pull to just go back to bed and open tiktok. 

I went off depression meds for a couple years (under the supervision of a psychiatrist). Recently I found a new therapist who mentioned it could be undiagnosed ADHD, innatentife type. I really related with people I found online talking about time management issues, brain fog, and an overall lack of motivation. I thought I had struck gold and managed to pull together enough motivation to get a psychiatrist appt and get all the documentation for it (this was hell, btw).

Well now I'm on Vyvanse (40mg), no dice. I started on 20 and have been increasing 10mg each monthish. A lot of people describe a sort of ""night and day"" clarity when starting ADHD meds for the first time and I haven't really noticed it at all. It does give me a small bit of energy in the mornings, but it's not enough to get me out of bed. It feels similar to the depression meds in that sure it's helping me mood and my energy, but it's not actually helping my motivation at all. 

I know activity and diet make a huge difference. I've had good streaks of going to the gym and cooking healthy in the past, but I can't even make it past 2ish months. And even when I am, it's fucking exhausting and I still feel this need to crawl into bed and shut out the world for hours at a time.

If it's not ADHD, and those meds won't work on me, then what the hell is it??? The closest thing I've been able to find that describes what I'm dealing with is the term Avolition. But that seems to only be a symptom of schizophrenia, and I have zero other (positive or negative) symptoms. I've seen several psychiatrists over my life and none of them have ever suspected something like that. But truly avolition I think more accurately describes what I'm dealing with than depression or ADHD does.

I'm in school right now trying to finish my masters, and I fallen servely behind academically. I just barely made it out of undergrad, with online classes low-key being a saving grace for me. 6 months ago I thought that ADHD diagnosis was going to be a game changer and I'd be able to get through the rest of this degree. But I'm staring down my last summer right now with about 2 semesters worth of work left to do. I NEED to fix this, I can't finish this degree let alone hold a job at this rate. I just, have absolutely no idea where to turn at this point. I'm so scared that nothing's actually wrong with me and I'm just like this. Because if this is how everyone else feels, and it's just a matter of willpower, I will fail. I simply do not have the energy or the will to live a normal life if this is what it's like. Idk what to do or where to go from here.

Hello, my name is Ramiro. I'm from Mexico and I'm desperate. I'm 29 years old and I'm unemployed. I haven't been able to find a job in Mexico. I speak Spanish fluently and English fairly decently. I've worked for Avis and Budget as a remote sales supervisor. I had a team where we handled online calls. I've also worked as an NPI engineer at a medical company called Fisher & Paykel Healthcare. Additionally, I've worked as a computer repair technician and built both mining and gaming computer systems. I'm knowledgeable about driver installation and troubleshooting in Windows.

I'm reaching out because I'm desperate. I'm willing to work for a minimum wage of $15 per hour. Send me a message, and we can discuss further. I'll send you my resume. We can also have a video call to talk about how I can help your business. It's not necessary to sign a work contract; we can work on trust if you prefer. I'm willing to do anything. I'm in dire need; if things continue like this, I'll end up on the streets. I have documents to prove my degree in Business Management Engineering.

Please, I really need the job. I'll work up to 15 hours a day if necessary. My skin color is very white; I'm not sure if it's important, but I mention it just in case someone cares.",1712522414.0,

throwindow,Who do you feel closer to ?,1,1bydw6g,0,"I'm sorry for piling up on this sub with a throaway account but I find it very useful because I feel completely isolated. I had a heated discussion with my mom where I told her that I feel closer to the drug addicts, the homeless and those with very badly perceived heavy mental illnesses in general that I do with ""normal"" people. I cited the people I met in the psych ward which are all deviants of some kind just like me.

I have tried all my life to relate and try to live the way normal people do. But I just cant for the life of me. Theres always something wrong, I don't fit, my head isnt screwed right, I can't think the way they do, I always have a million coping mechanisms to bypass certain emotions and anything could trigger a phase, so I always have to pay attention, I'm always tired, I need complete silence, I struggle to form friendships let alone romantic relationships etc. I'm just an anomaly. I'm on the fringe. So yes, I relate more to those on the fringe as well. The misunderstood, those who are judged by bad actions without considering the scope of the issue, and the homeless.

She's asked me if it meant I wanted to live in the streets. Missing the point so completely that I just walked out and asked her to form her own opinion on my answer to that question.

I have a good relationship with my mom but she is very ""positive thinking"" driven and I just.. can't. There is no viable options for me out there. I feel I will always depend on something, I feel completely handicapped, I feel my mind deteriorating everyday and my grasp on reality loosening. But how do you explain that and be taken seriously ?

throthro321123,Should i go see a therapist because I have suspicion of mental illness as a 16 year old kid?,2,1by6ef6,0,"Typing this from a throwaway account because of embarassment.

Im sorry if this is unreadable and all over the place, im writing whatever comes to my mind while im on my breaking point.

So my whole life i felt different, never had any friends and was the ""weird kid"" with different interests and got bullied for that my whole life up until 8th grade. When i was 5 my mother divorced my father and moved with me from a central asian country to germany, because of the language barrier i didnt fit it at first but i tried my best. I was doing weird stuff because of my ""intrusive thoughts"", basically i just did any weird shit that came to my mind and kinda asked to be bullied and did this up until 7th grade where i learned to mask these intrusive thoughts and not let them out, i made weird/funny faces all the time said the same things all the time and i honestly thought it was funny. I also never had any friends because i never was going out and stayed home playing video games and developed a superiority complex and found myself better than all the other kids at school. Most friends i made were on the internet and stopped talking to me because they got mad at me for something that i didnt understand, but recently i had a fight with my close friend and he said being friends and spending time with me was like being a woman married to a abusive man that comes home from work to beat here even tho she is already tired and just wants to relax. This was kinda a wake up call and made me realise i was acting like a narcissist, never admiting i was at fault, barely apologizing, being overly aggressive,impulsive and hating to admit i was wrong to the point where i just wouldnt do it. Similar thing to that is that i hate showing weakness and losing in any kind and showing that other people have somehow hurt/negatively impacted me and never shown my feelings because im ashamed to admit it and it makes me feel weak and inferior which i hate, if i got beat up at school and my mom asked me what happened i would lie and say i won the fight. From the years of bullying i developed anxiety and always feel judged and watched by people on the street, im extremely nervous walking in school even tho the bullying stopped and no one bothers me anymore and i even found ""school friends"", but i dont think they actually like me because im not that close to them as they are to each other and i mask my interests from them too. I tried masking that anxiety by being bold and acting like a ""popular kid"" and being overly talkative and friendly but i seem to just annoy people. As a kid i used to bite my nails alot but i stopped for some time, it came back tho with my anxiety and i started harming myself in the form of ripping/biting/cutting the skin on my fingertips,around my nails and the white skin on top of my nails because i hate seeing burrs on my fingers and i try to fix these imperfections but i end up making it worse and my fingers bleeding, my fingers look horrible and im ashamed of them but i cant stop doing that, i even started doing it during class with any sharp object i find and i cant stop even tho it hurts and i bleed, i think its somehow linked to these intrusive thoughts i have that used to be kinda like tics but i can control them now. I also alot of that weird stuff as a kid i did for attention, because before i moved i received lots of love from everyone as a kid and got addicted to that attention, but after i moved i was alone with my mother who didnt have enough time to spend with me and brother who hated me for being ""spoiled"" and a wuss. It was alone at home at a young age alot and it had a bad effect on me because i didnt understand time back then and didnt know where everyone was, i wanted to jump out the window to go look for my mom. So now i dont feel loved by anyone at all, i dont feel cared for at all, i had thoughts to do something to myself so people would pay attention to me like overdose or worse but i didnt do it yet, i also had thoughts of hurting people because they live a better life than me and they dont deserve it. This might sound like im insane but i want to be groomed by a older woman who would care for me and love me and pamper me without me having to do anything. i have all these insane thoughts but its like there's 2 of me and one is has these insane thoughts and the other one judges them and thinks theyre insane and is aware of what i think of. i dont know what to do with my life, i procrastinate alot, my grades are declining, my dream of being a fashion designer or a badminton player seems unreachable because i dont have any skills besides playing this shitty fucking computer, i dont have motivation to do anything, any minor inconvenience complety breaks my motivation and discourages me from doing anything. I started going to the gym full of motivation, but it didnt last for long, after a month walking an hour in the cold alone at night took a toll on me and i got tired of it, i dont know if its a valid reason or im actually a wuss seeking excuses to stop doing hard work. im scared to go see a therapist because they might be the ignorant type and say ""you seem normal, u hold eye contact well etc"" and embarass me, i had alot of problems with eye contact but it got better recently, it used to be that if i dont even look down my eyes start tearing up and i couldnt hold eye contact at all but it got better now, although if i talk about serious topics i cant hold eye contact at all and have to look away to not show my emotion. My mother was that kind of ignorant and said when i asked her ""we wouldve caught on to that at a young age, your completely ""normal"" dont worry"". By the way about my mother, after the wake up call and seeing that i act like a narcissist i noticed the same behaviour in my mother but she is more prone to show weakness and sadness, she often has these meltdowns because to be honest im not a good kid to my mother and often yell at her when she talks to me when im mad, and in the past year and a half im constantly on edge and mad, but im such a asshole that i because i cant accept a loss in the fucking video game and cant admit that im a worse player i would just find excuses and yell at my mother if she came to me, but later when i cool down i realize how bad i acted but i dont have actually the courage nor the strength to apologize, i also often annoyed her for my own pleasure and made her mad which makes me feel like shit when i now think about this like im an actual asshole. After the fight i had with my closest internet friend, i was attached to him for a while even though he said i shouldve died when i attempted suicide, i just couldnt leave him even after the things he said but now i dont have anybody to talk to at all, im not close with my brother, my relationship with him became better only recently in the past few years, but he used to beat me and hate me and i cant open up to him. I dont have any friends in real life too because no one seems to be open minded, not judgemental and have the same interests as me, even now i sometimes feel superior to them.  
Im seeking advice here because i really dont even know where i am anymore, my spring break started and my sleep schedule got so bad i slept trough the entire day and stayed awake in the night, didnt get up from my bed for hours even after waking up, barely went out of my room, rarely brushed my teeth and didnt shower, all my thoughts right now are just negative towards everyone else who has a better life than me, i also deserve to be cared for, i also deserve to have my life fully paid trough, i also deserve to get the stuff that i want all the time without worrying about the finances of my mother.  
I dont have any motivation to do anything i just wake up eat once and  play a video game that i dont even want to fucking play or lay in bed.

Im discouraged from going to see a therapist because i dont know myself if im really ill or just a bad person who is weak since im aware of all my personality problems etc. I forgot to mention too that im a coward in a way that i lie alot to my internet friends to not seem like a complete loser, i make up stories like a pathological liar so they dont know i dont have a actual life outside of the internet, i would lie about the most random basic stuff any normal person would experience in their life.",1712501736.0,
Methodled,Break from Reddit n other social media,2,1by5xza,0,"Recently I have been finding myself feeling more anxiety over my own life which stems from how I’m revolving my life choices on the questions or news posted here. I find myself feeling good when I post something that others agree upon and upvote me or support me. But when I post something where it has no interaction or negative feedback I get so caught up in them. They aren’t always bad advice but often I want to dig deeper into my own arguments rather than accept what others say.  I know it isn’t good bc it sounds like I’m not willing to accept criticisms and honestly it is something I want/need to work on. Currently it has caused me a lot of internal frustrations. 

Additionally it’s making me fearful about what people think of my life choices or trying to please others in order to go along with the masses. I have a people pleasing character so  in order to” keep the peace”, I go along with the masses and have this internal struggle over whether that is truly what I want versus what I think others want for me. For the most part, the advices I have gotten here are good and offer diff points of view to my own sometimes but I also feel this fear or judgment of doing something against what I perceive others want.

Lastly I’m finding I’m spending way too much time on these sites esp in the bathroom or even brushing my teeth. I’m on my phone scrolling while trying to balance holding my tooth brush .. I know it sounds so hypocritical seeing I’m posting about an issue of trying to cut out social media.

  I find myself not able to be myself or make mistakes n learn the hard way or fearing my choices aren’t good enough. I judge and compare others lives and worrying my relationships and life arent good enough. This prob stems from some inner boredom and loneliness to connect with others (SO, friends family etc)in my own life hence I’m putting a greater emphasis on the world of the internet where strangers don’t know me and I can say whatever or do whatever I want. I prob also want to escape responsibilities so I’m on these sites more to keep busy rather than do what I need to do. 

 At the end of the day I gotta live my real life and accept whatever comes my way and not worry about how many upvotes or downvotes or likes / comments shares etc.  ",1712500525.0,

I blocked the guy because I literally can’t stand him, yelled and told him to leave me alone when he tried to greet me at work, i’ve been completely ignoring all of my coworkers unless they ask something specific about work, i left the work group chat and i plan to do the absolute minimum when it comes to work from now on.

It still happens now when my friends are over or when i go outside. Because of my mental illness and neediness, I'm constantly pushed away and left to fend for myself. Yesterday, my friends asked me to go out with them. As much as i hate social interaction, i didn't want to say no. I went out with them, and when i started talking about my special interest, i got ignored, pushed away, and told to go sit somewhere else. Every time this happens, i fall into a deep depression episode because i cant tell if everyone hates me or not. I feel like I'm too annoying to be hung out with or acknowledged. I don't want to be viewed as annoying, so I'm isolating myself from everyone. Today, i started thinking about how these same experiences can happen to other people, and cause them to isolate themselves just like me. I wanted to know what everyone thought about this.

Suicidal thoughts, most days

Panic attacks, most days

Severe depression and anxiety

OCD/delusion, at times I need to point my hands and feet certain directions as if lazers are coming out and need to be facing an exit of the room.
I need to take exactly 4 steps on each type of flooring. So if I'm walking on concrete about to go onto grass, I have to make sure I have taken steps that equal a multiple 4 on the concrete before stepping off, sorry if that doesn't make sense.

I get very obsessed over things I get hyperfocused on, if I am pulled away from a task that I am focused on it makes me very anxious, sad angry etc.

I keep getting very angry and arguing and thinking I am completely in the right until later on when I have calmed down and I realise I was wrong. I feel like it's not me when this happens almost like im in 3rd person and not in control when I argue.

Sometimes when I'm anxious my brain can get stuck on loop with singular words. So like all I can think for example is ""bounce bounce bounce"" over and over again but not limited to any word.

I forget to eat or make food most of the time and only eat when prompted.

I find myself unable to concentrate on things a lot.

I am always interrupting people in conversations and I don't realise it.

I struggle with too much noise.

I got very overwhelmed if too much is happening at once.

 I have been suffering most of these symptoms for as long as I can remember, suicidal thoughts have become me frequent over the past few months, which is why I'm seeking help. I am currently on sertraline 200mg but they do not seem to be helping at all.

I have probably missed out a few things I experience but I will add them in the comments when I remember. If my symptoms ring any bells I would appreciate any advice, I will not take any diagnosis over the Internet seriously but I am desperate for an idea of what could be going on.

Fluffy_Trip_6514,does anyone have any idea what this could be? ://,2,1bxee70,5,"hi, sorry, i’ve never posted here before so i hope it’s within all the guidelines but i just.. need some sort of opinion from someone here. 

i’m 23F, autistic, currently living w parents post-college til i move out. the last part matters bc since i’ve moved back with my parents for a bit, i’ve been having things happen that i think could possibly maybe be some form of (oddly frequent) depersonalization/derealization (?) but i genuinely do not know how to even search properly online to find an answer for it. lately, i have moments at work or at home when i’m relaxing or even having a conversation, where it almost feels like whatever i’m seeing through my eyes is a movie. and i know that that’s the most basic description and criteria of depersonalization , but it’s not just that. 

other than feeling like i’m not really there, it’s like whatever else is going on around me is weirdly still processing perfectly. they aren’t moments where i go quiet or distant even when i’m alone — i still hear and understand and acknowledge everything and i’m conscious of the fact that i’m obviously the person speaking but it’s like my brain starts overthinking on how that’s even happening. like things like “how does my mouth know how to move if my brain isn’t wanting it to? i thought your brain and thoughts are what lead to your physical movements. my ear itches now that i said that, what if my brain is melting out of my ears (ik this sounds silly but it’s a genuine thought and concern at the moment)? would they even tell me? is that why she keeps looking over my shoulder? [touches ear to check] oh okay.. yeah no, that was really silly lol. but what if it’s just slowly melting and it just hasnt leaked yet?”  

even though i’m able to still like respond and process things i’m hearing and interacting with, the fact that i legitimately feel like it isn’t me doing it but my body just doing it for me out of habit to keep me from getting fired and/or worried about… it definitely impacts work for me. not the quality, but it makes work even more draining and overstimulating than it already is with me being autistic so when i get home, every single day i’m incredibly burnt out. it’s to the point where my parents had an intervention with me to make sure im not depressed again but the weird thing is, i’m not. i’ve been depressed many many times, and unfortunately that’s gone to some pretty dark places in the past, but this is *not* depression. i don’t have any symptoms of depression really other than whatever this is? so i really don’t understand. 

initially, i thought maybe it’s just my anxiety getting worse and i just need to get back on medication but, similar to my super fun times with depression, it’s different. i’ve had diagnosed anxiety since i was 13. for 10 years, i’ve witnessed my anxiety get better, worse, change a bit in nature for me, etc, but it’s always still within the realm of things you’d expect with anxiety. i’ve never felt like this before. could it just be big life changes and a new stage in my young adulthood that’s somehow triggering my anxiety and just making me paranoid? am i even actually dissociating or am i just being over dramatic and it’s just a moment where i get anxious and overthink and spiral? 

idk anymore. honestly anything would be appreciated — i’m not looking to diagnose myself via reddit or something irresponsible; i just want an idea of what others who have personally been in a similar boat may think is happening. even if it’s just to say “this happened to me once. i was dehydrated and already had anxiety and just needed meds again” or “ur overthinking it, chill” that would be like an immense help compared to me just pacing my room trying to figure out how to ask google what’s happening.

linusrg,"Random Theory - Fragile X Syndrome Affects Trans Women Less Than Cis Men, but More Than Cis Women.",0,1bxhk5k,2,"Note: As of writing this my scientific knowledge is far from complete on this matter. I just really enjoy theorizing about these things. I welcome criticism to what I say as it allows me to grow my understanding. So feel free to criticize what I say here, I am all for it.

For a while now, ever since I started to learn I was a bit different, I have begun to look into mental/developmental disorders and self diagnose. During that time I managed to gain a genuine interest in them. I had self diagnosed myself with ADHD, OCD, and Autism, before getting an official diagnosis for ADHD and Autism. I didn't get one for OCD simply because I've managed to get it under control enough for it to not hinder my daily function. I do feel like I have it though. Being right about having Autism as well as ADHD, is what made me feel like it would be ok if I write what I am about to write about in the next paragraph. I haven't been officially diagnosed with FXS, however, a lot of my symptoms seem to like up with it, and my cis sister definitely has manifestations of FSX physical traits too (mainly hyper extended finger joints and more prominent ears. These features are less prominent than they are on myself, and she also doesn't have flat feet.), without any mental disorder. I haven't gotten tested yet but I am hoping to soon. 

Anyway, the one thing that always threw me off about my hypothesis that I had Fragile X was the fact that my intelligence seemed to be completely in tact which is, from what I can see almost unheard of in men with Fragile X. I became even more baffled when I met someone who is, incredibly, a lot like myself in regards to how they function. (We get along really well together, and I've already talked about what I am talking about here with them.) They had pretty strong learning difficulties/executive function issues, just like I do. (Hyperfixations, prioritization skill issues, time management issues, etc.) But also like me her intelligence is quite high. Which, considering that she is AMAB, just like me, shouldn't be the case. (We are both trans women by the way.) 

This has led me to theorize that trans women have a greater chance of being less affected by FSX than cis men, but more affected than most cis women. Going of the current trans theory of, ""during fetal brain development a persons brain is exposed to too much estrogen or testosterone when it isn't supposed to be, either mascuilizing or feminizing the brain when it isn't supposed to"", I think trans women might have a more ""feminine"" brain, which could potentially allow that person to escape various aspects of the mental issues that come along with FXS, such as/mainly intellectual issues, while at the time still having much stronger FSX traits than cis women, because they don't have a ""backup"" X chromosome like cis women would.

What do you think of this theory?

(I know people who think they are intelligent and like to talk about how they are, usually aren't. I promise u I hate to be that type of person. I am just doing so here from a completely logical scientific theorization angle, because I love theorizing about these things, and it is easiest to do with myself. As well, I know myself the best obviously.)

EinKomischerSpieler,Do you also suppress your emotions?,4,1bwwhrd,2,"I'm not talking about toxic positivity. I mean it as in ""I feel like showing emotions is a sign of weakness"". Ever since I suffered bullying in middle school, I stopped showing emotions to people and in the very rare occasions I do show emotions, I feel an intense feeling that tells me I'm weak. My therapist and I have named this voice ""the dictator"". He's also responsible for other feelings (like telling I'm never gonna be good enough).

Thing is, I don't feel like stopping being this way. It's like my safe place. I can be an empathic person. I love my friends. I talk to them. But I'll never, for example, cry in front of them. If I do, I'll feel very guilty about that. 

Today I was feeling very depressed, I was even having suicidal thoughts. I thought about calling a friend so that I wouldn't be alone, but I didn't want to be weak in front of them or feel like a burden to them.

The same thing happens with attachment. I consider myself aromantic, so I feel little to none romantic attraction to people. I'm fairly sure that stems from the fact that I don't want to depend on people. At the same time, I'm very dependent on my mom for everything. I show emotions only to her, because I know she won't reject me. But I'm also feeling guilty of the times I was troublesome to her, i.e., the times my mental health was acting up. I also feel safe to vent on Reddit, as I feel detached from the people here.

I think it's a mix of toxic masculinity, bad attachment styles, bad upbringing and trauma. I remember I was fairly emotional when I was in middle school. It reminds me of one time when I upset a friend of mine and he refused to talk with me. I was so sad I kneeled in front of him and the whole class and asked for forgiveness. Now I think of that as being cringe, but at the time I couldn't care less about the class laughing at us, I just wanted to be forgiven.

Neat-Medium-7655,Please Help me. I quit my job 2.5 years ago (25M now) trying to make a better mind/body/life for me. I am worse now than when I started and will only get worse unless something is done,1,1bx1fto,1,"My last and only job was factory work for 3 years making wires for cars. I should have left a lot earlier but I convinced myself that that was all I was good for and stayed there for 2 and half years longer than I should have. But there was no present nor future in that trash of a barely paying job so after my colleague who put me down almost every day left, after a lot of months, I actually gained some confidence, realized that I was not worthless and that he was the problem, and decided to leave it so I could make something out of myself while I lived with parents who could financially handle me.

However, nothing turned out right.

I am a very easily addictable person. Very. Even as a kid, I was watching TV for 12h straight everyday without any problems. I barely had any time and how I don’t have any eyesight problems is beyond me. I stopped watching TV and I simply removed it from my room. The problem was finally gone, right? No. One addiction is exchanged for another one or is just mixed with another one.

Here are the biggest ones:

TV>Facebook Games>Anime (I have watched more in a couple of years than some people will do in their lifetime)>Manga>Movies>Series>Porn>Hentai>YouTube>Reddit>Pokemon Go> Now it is Manhwa (comics)

And the food is always in there somewhere because I have more food in my house than some small stores (I didn’t buy them, my unreasonable food junkie of a father that literally looks like he carries 4 babies in his stomach can’t stop buying trash even though everyone is telling him to stop because it will be the end of him and our family) and when something new is bought I usually can’t stop snorting it. And, after a week, when the sugar high is gone and I am back to reality and there is barely any taste in that trash like in a stale gum I am visibly fatter and grosser. But then I try to combine the new things with old things to get the same feeling (it never happens) and then I would get even fatter (pastry with cheese, Nutella and cookies, Pizza with different hams).

For anyone who ever wanted to speed run fattness here is one trick. It’s called salt and sweet. While you are doing something passive (TV, YouTube, Series…) you eat something salty (like popcorn), then sweet (cookies…), then salty then sweet, and then you wash it away with juice. You will be fat in no time. You are welcome.

Almost all of the things above are fine if they are done in moderation. But they aren’t. Not even a little. That is why I call them addictions.

I wanted to learn many things (coding, digital marketing, content creation, video editing) but the second it becomes anything difficult or the second I touch one of the addictions suddenly weeks pass me by like I am in a coma and almost always makes me feel absolutely dreadful. I have people who want the best for me and yet I fail them hour after hour that becomes day after day that becomes week after week>month after month> and now finally year after year. I have probably wasted in total 2y out of 2y6m over nothing.

I have tried many things to focus on doing what is relevant and to stop myself from them like buying programs for PC or phone (Cold Turkey, extensions) or getting accountability buddies, Boss as a Service, reading books, wall writing, punching myself, giving money away if I fuck up to people I know or don’t know and yet I am the same useless/skill-less fatso that started this shit 2.5 years ago. The only thing that changed is my age I think that my personality is a bit more cynical. The only reason why my weight is about the same is because I walked like a maniac for 3 cold months while barely eating because of Pokemon Go. Otherwise, I would have been even fatter. But being 105kg is not exactly a thing to brag about. I am literally the same weight as when I quit my job.

I have never had friends or a girlfriend. Period and full stop. If you have kissed an opposite gender then you are immediately better than me. I have people who will call me friends but won’t speak to me or anything for years on end and I don’t really consider them as one. And that is probably the core problem and the solution. Because if I had friends then I probably wouldn’t use up so much of my time on useless trash. But I have no idea what to do about it and even if I did I doubt that I would do it because I barely listen to myself.

And the same kind of thing is happening right now. Now I am learning German to possibly find a better life, and a job, in Germany because I highly doubt that I will find it where I live now. But I am going back to my old ways. I am back behind 10 classes and yet here I am watching Only Fools and Horses yet again while classes pile up and I have to lie to my grandpa that everything is going okay and that this time things will work out. But after I have disappointed him so much over these 2.5 years I don’t think he believes me anymore even though he smiles at me.

I am going through the same patterns (eating more food than necessary and procrastinating with some kind of addiction) and I know that in 3 months time, I will be a lot fatter and mentally worse person than I am today.

I have been through this shit before so I can easily notice it. But what is the point in noticing it if I don’t change it?

So can someone help me out so that I don’t waste any more of my life because I will get even older and I really, really don’t want to wake up in my 40s alone, broke, unloved, without any life experiences that don’t have to do with the PC/phone?

Anything goes in any way (books, resources, DMs, Courses, whatever).

I just don’t want to blow my head off because I will believe that nothing can change and that I should just stop trying and finally to stop existing. Those kinds of thoughts are not foreign to me in the slightest.",1712373674.0,

i’m 18f, and i find that i dont really feel any guilt/remorse or sympathy for anything and anyone. i noticed this when my aunt that i was very close with passed away, and instead of feeling sad like any normal person would, i didn’t feel anything. ppl say i was just processing things but even as time passed the grief never came to me. it was as if she never existed in the first place. i also hold little regard for whatever happens to my friends and family. i don’t care if i hurt them, as long as my goals are achieved and unless they are in the way of something i want. i pretend to care because i know i should, but deep down i couldn’t care less.

the same goes for other people. even if dangerous stuff happens to them i can’t find it in myself to be bothered. things that other people would find sickening and heavy on the heart would not affect me in any way. and i know i’m insensitive for saying this, but i also feel zero sympathy for what’s going in p4lestine and isra3l, like i don’t care with whats happening to the people or if it happened to someone i know. im aware that i SHOULD care and that its not something to take lightly, but it just goes to show how numb i am to things. i still feel happiness and good emotions, i feel anger and i feel sadness if something happens to me, but i can’t remember the last time i felt anything related to sympathy/empathy. the only time i do care is if something is directly affecting me and hindering the chances of getting what i want. which concerns me since i’m aware that this behavior isn’t normal.

i also place great importance in myself and my abilities. i like to think i’m better than everyone else then get deeply affected when they surpass me in some aspects.

My mind entered a state of denial where I can't recognise the significance of these events anymore, maybe to protect me from regret. It feels as if I'm living in a dream world where these were insignificant events, and those emotions were insignificant. Feels like an illusion where life is more meaningless. In the months following I lost my ability to recall memories vividly, imagine vividly, have a dream / motivation for the future, ability to experience meaningful emotions, be sincere, and an emotional/subconscious sense of what's right and wrong (I still know what's right logically). I know i should be more worried and feeling more dread than I should, but these emotions are gone. I feel like I have gone back to the mind of a child where I only look forward to hedonistic pleasures, and I'm scared to pursue my dreams or become independent.

And then this one little thing has sent me back to square one - I have this pit of dread in my chest, I feel sick, I can’t focus, I feel suicidal / like hurting myself, I actually feel like I’m losing my mind, the feeling is consuming me I feel like I can’t function. And it’s just because the idea of someone else having struggled with something triggers me so bad. It makes me feel like I HAVE to prove that I have struggled as well. I’m constantly trying to justify my struggles, and as soon as I find out that someone has had it worse I lose my shit. I feel like I have to find a way in which I’ve had it worse. I even fantasise about awful things happening to me, and finding a way to make them happen, so I would feel like I deserve to struggle, and so that I would be the one who’s had it worse. It’s so stupid, like my logical mind knows it’s ridiculous, and honestly disgusting that I would almost envy someone for almost losing their mum, like how much of a shit person do you have to be. I hate myself so so much for it. But I just can’t help it, I want so badly to get rid of it but I can’t, I’ve been trying for years and I thought I might’ve gotten over it, but it seems not. 

For reference, I had some issues, mostly from the age of about 13 (19 now), with a variety of different people being emotionally manipulative (a lot of emotional blackmail and threats / being made fully responsible for peoples’ severe mental health issues from a young age / gaslighting e.g into thinking I’d be raped & abused / etc.), but all of these people were just close friends, not family or partners, so it seems silly to have let it affect me this badly, like I wouldn’t class it as trauma, it was just upsetting at the time. But I have to assume that these feelings are resulting from that. Which feels a bit pathetic but oh well.

I really want it to work out with this guy, and I don’t want me not being able to handle my triggers to ruin it. I also know that there’s a chance of this making me toxic - I feel so guilty saying this, but I know that if something happened like his mum getting cancer again, I know that would make me freak out so bad and I would struggle to be there for him like I should be. 

If anyone can relate it would make me feel so much better, and if anyone knows how to get rid of this feeling it would be much appreciated. 

Edit: Should probably have made clear that I would never actually act on these impulses by saying something stupid and unsympathetic, or offloading on someone or something, I can keep it under control in that sense. It’s the thoughts themselves which I’m struggling to control and which make it hard for me to function, which in turn would mean I couldn’t be there for someone emotionally as much as I would like.",1712313407.0,

Lohikarmi,I don’t know how I feel anymore TW: suicidal thoughts,3,1bw5m0x,1,"TW: suicidal thoughts, attempt

At this point I‘m just confused about what I‘m feeling. Diagnosed with severe depression and ADHD. For years I‘ve been cycling between feeling nothing, feeling somewhat okay and feeling so depressed that I want to do nothing but sleep. 

Currently I don’t even know what I‘m feeling. I‘m still somewhat active and keeping up with hobbies (reading and woodworking), but it doesn’t really feel good anymore. Not in the constantly slightly dissociated way as I‘ve experienced previously, but just apathy to most things at this point. 

I haven’t been working for a while due to a burnout in 2021. I tried to start again last year, but I only managed 4 weeks before everything went down the drain again. Money is tight and I‘m forced to get a job again, which will restart the whole cycle all over.

The only things keeping me here are friends and projects I want to at least finish and even that didn’t stop me from trying to end it in November.

I honestly don’t know where I‘m going with this. Maybe I just need to vent.

At this point I‘m basically just tired of everything tbh. I‘d love to get on my feet again, but I don’t know how or if it’s even possible. Even taking meds is a chore. I‘d love to travel for a while, but the option just isn’t there due to money.

And before anyone asks: Yes, I‘ve been in therapy for a few years. No, it did not help.",1712281239.0,

Responsible-Score234,Anxiety? Bipolar? Idk.,0,1bwbvri,1,"I’m gonna try my best to remember what’s been happening throughout the past month or so, due to the fact I forget what happened on one day when the next day comes, dk why but. So very recently I’ve been pretty..concerned for myself, I’m currently 17, I turn 18 in August(can’t wait tbh) and I’ve been monitoring my every day life very closely, and I’ve noticed something..

Now let me just start off by saying, I’m not looking for a diagnosis, i understand it’s NOT reddits place to do that kind of thing, I just wanna talk about my recent experiences, as a way to try harder to recall them for when I can talk to a professional so it would become easier for them to help me out.

Okay so to get into it, I would say my concerns started somewhere around early march, I noticed that I have a somewhat constant change in my moods, I wouldn’t say nessecarily any of them really matched the type of things a person with bipolar, but more like your normal happy and sad, now how I would describe the happy is like very talkative( even considering I’m a huge antisocial) like I would feel the need to talk out and and class and doing so just felt easier, of course when ever I do speak out in class, I usually make no sense which is usually my biggest fear when it comes to that, but I at times like that,I don’t mind

Some other things that’s conspire is I find myself dancing around ALOT! I’ll put in my headphones and DANCE LIKE NO ONES WATCHING! 🕺, and I just feel alot cooler when I’m happy, and then when it comes to sadness, I wouldn’t say I describe it as depression, even though I experience a lot of depression like symptoms like loss of interest, oversleeping or under sleep( i do both), extreme sadness or hopelessness, but these don’t usually occur when I’m sad, but I’m always getting sad about something, but within a week or two it doesn’t even matter to me anymore. 

But there was a point over spring break of where I started to. Notice I was starting to express manic like symptoms, there was this one day of where I was trying to look for something, so I went to my backpack to look for it, next thing I knew I was trying to clean out my backpack, very soon after that, I was trying to hang up posters, then after that I went to looking through my yearbook, I started like 4 different animations in less than 20 minutes, I was extremely talkative, I could tell my brother was getting sick of hearing me talk. And I actually seemed interested in taking care of myself finally!, that’s all died down alot by now though. But then there was. More concern that transpired on Monday when I had began to overthink so bad I was sent into a full blown anxiety attack, it was awful! And after that I felt depressed, I napped for a few hours, and after I woke up, I felt still pretty blah, but soon after I was up dancing around, I tired playing Minecraft, but I didn’t enjoy it like usual.

I’m not sure if all of this is a valid cause for concern, there’s a lot more that’s happened that I can’t really get too into detail purely out of embarrassment, some potentially life ruining, I’m not ever really focused on my self or my mental health, so quite a bit has to happen before I start to even get suspicious whether there is something wrong with me mentally, I’m starting to get concerned. Cause it f really feels like “happy and sad” is turning into “depressed, anxious, irritable, and as much as I hate to say it manic” I’m gonna try to talk to someone about all this, but I just wanna know if any of this is valid for thinking if I’m bipolar or even if I have anxiety, by now feeling some sort of anxiety has become an everyday thing, should I look into asking someone about bipolar or anxiety or should I just try to take a chill pilll and relax and stop worrying.

a_living_being_,I am feeling extremely embarrassed,3,1bvuulk,0,"Hey everyone.
I have been suffering from anxiety for a very very long time. I remember feeling weird even I was a kid. I couldn't understand those feelings before but after reading about mental health and anxiety, I could finally relate those feelings to something.
I have taken therapy and I was informed that it's because of childhood trauma and that almost everyone in my childhood made it worse for me.

I have suffered from social anxiety for a very long time, so much so, that I was incapable of ordering a Pizza even if my life dependant on it.

Anyways, I am now 26, and much better in terms of social anxiety. I still feel extremely scared of a lot of things in life. One example is swimming.

I decided to challenge myself and enroll in a swimming class with my bf. Today was my 5th day. Things were going fine (mostly) until something really embarassing happened.

So as I am new to swimming, I was asked to swim in the shallow part of the pool till I gain more experience and confidence.
Today, the trainer thought I could try going to the deeper end with some assistance.

I was obviously terrified but also wanted to try doing that.

I went ahead and swam half way, when I started panicking and basically went to hold onto the rod at the side of the pool. Even while holding the rod, I sort of felt my body going inside the pool and I instantly started panicking.

I don't know what happened next, my flight response kicked in and basically I spent the next 30s climbing out of the pool using the rod as a step.

After I did that, I was obviously out of breath , and the trainer had those pity eyes. I did feel a little embarassed at that time but it was overshadowed by my anxiety.

Anyways, as I am recalling that instance now, I feel extremely embarrassed of what I did. I really don't know how to deal with this feeling. I sort of don't feel like going to the pool class ever again. ",1712255679.0,

I’ve always dealt with mental issues since o was a kid (I’m 19) and in the past year everything has gotten a lot worse.

I (21F) have been in a relationship with my gf since 3 years and we’ve known each other for 8 years now. Went through up and downs with her, really went through the worst but we’ve overcome everything together. Getting with her was my dream coming true and it seems like the perfect person for me, really. 

But it seems like I’ve been struggling a lot mentally lately (since about one year and a half), and I don’t know what to think anymore. There’s really nothing wrong with her, what’s more she surprises me more and more these days cause she’s incredibly patient and caring with me. 

Thing is, I feel grateful, but I also don’t. Everytime she tells me that she loves me more than everything, that i’m her soulmate, that she wanna marry me, that she’ll love me forever, I feel like an overwhelming anxiety. It’s like I love her but I really fucking wish she’d broke up with me at a certain point, and the thought of us staying together forever scares me so much. I’m positive that I would be extremely happy with her because she’s really perfect, but I don’t know. I don’t see the point in me breaking up with her, but deep inside I have these desire to be so fucked up that she starts to despise me and then she’d broke up with me. 

I feel like everything is going wrong with me more and more the months are passing. Everytime I think I’m getting better, I just get more crazy. 

I feel sick and I feel like I wanna die one day, the other day I feel happy, I make plans thinking “it’s gonna end anyway one day”. I feel like going crazy one moment, but if I force myself to see her instead of rotting in my bed all day, it all gets better so I think I’m alright. The second she tells me that she’s so happy with me, I feel so much pity for her. I feel pity because I don’t know if I’m stable enough to keep her really happy, because I feel like wearing a mask in front of her a lot of times cause I’m hiding what I’m thinking most of the times. 

I feel like there’s worms all over me and I just wanna disappear from the world and destroy myself in any way possible.

Unfortunately my trauma clashed with hers because i struggle with anxious attachment, abandonment wounds, emotional monitoring, toxic shame. I was struggling with ongoing traumatic relationship sydrome because of the constant lack of empathy and validation. I believe she may also have alexythemia as well. Her fearful avoidance caused her to be hot and cold, and almost any conflict you can bet she would either say she wanted to break up or hint that we are incompatible or whatever it may be. Things started so good between us that the toxicity snuck up on me. She started being emotionally unavailable and neglectful. Telling me things like “you’ll never be my safe person” and never offering reassurance and withholding nurturing. She didn’t understand the importance of sex, and claimed she doesnt experience shame.

I have been taking Rexulti for the past few months now. It’s been working well for the most part, but it’s fairly obvious that the main side effect I am struggling with is weight gain.

It’s almost to the point that it’s becoming a food addiction. 

I guess what I am asking is if there is any way to combat these cravings or maybe curb my appetite while taking this medication?

That really took me aback because that had happened to me from time to time and has since I was a child. For me it comes on like those scenes in films when the camera rapidly widens the perspective depth, like zooming in or out but not really (I hope you get what I mean). Everything will then look disproportionate, and I feel like everything looks bigger, like everything grew in size and I'm perceiving everything like I am the size of Thumbelina. It feels like when your ears start ringing but for your eyes. Faces will also look really weird, even my own face. It will sometimes slowly fade away or go back to normal suddenly, or go back and forth relatively quickly.

Sometimes I will also get a weird feeling that I cannot process my sense of touch properly, my body and everything I do feels alien and wrong, dull and heavy. It can happen in the middle of me doing anything, I distinctly remember it happening several times when I was carrying my brothers when they were younger, which really scared me because it felt like I wouldn't realise if I was dropping them or hurting them.

I don't know, I haven't talked about it much since it's so weird and out there, and the few times I've described it to someone they looked at me like I was crazy.

I've been depressed as a kid, I've seen some specialists but never really went to therapy. I was on SSRIs for some time but stopped abruptly (which shouldn't have happened). Since then I've had my ups and downs. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and self harm but never attempted. I had to start homeschooling cause being around people made me feel really bad. The problem is, lately it's been getting way worse. I struggle with mood swings, my mood changes really fast, usually every few hours. I know that bipolar people usually have wayyyy longer episodes but I'm just really worried, because my alcoholic dad was most likely bipolar (never diagnosed but some people have said it was very obvious and I agree) and I know it can be genetic. I'm also young which leads me to think that the symptoms may look a bit different. I feel suicidal, frustrated and helpless and then suddenly it passes and I feel the need to fix my life. I'm also very aware of it but I can't stop my thoughts. It feels like there are 2 people in my head arguing and I'm just watching them. Whenever I feel bad, I feel like I have to do things that would make me feel even worse even though my ""aware side"" knows I shouldn't do this.

* I was Physically ""Punished"" (abused) at a very young age.  (memory hadn't even developed)
* self-destructive tendencies since 4-5 years old. parents never addressed it.
* parents often fought in front of me during my younger years and would storm out of the house frequently.(always came back thankfully)
* severely depressed for past 7 years, was completely untreated by myself and family
* Frequent Nightmares/false awakenings type 2/sleep paralysis/ hallucinations (mainly auditory)
* currently getting talk therapy/counseling while in college. completely new to managing mental health

Present. 

* currently taking zero medication
* regularly going to talk therapy and keeping up with academics (Unlike fall 2023)

&#x200B;

* I shutdown periodically throughout the day and feel the need to block out everything and everyone.
* extremely uncomfortable around everybody (friends/family/therapist)

(even brother/parents, I feel like i don't know/remember them well anymore) 

&#x200B;

* easily switch between paranoia and putting on a front for friends/family.

&#x200B;

* I find it very easy to be emotional support for friends but i never let anyone help me. (Maybe bc I think they cant help or I don't want people to see how bad Its gotten) Should i let people in or leave it to therapy/counseling?

&#x200B;

* should i seek a real diagnosis? 
* Ive developed muscle twitches within since 3 years ago. Should i be worried?
* Ive stopped self destructive tendencies since early 2024. Thank the Good Lord. Huge milestone for me.

earlier today i tried to remember what he looked like. the last time i saw him was about 6-7 months ago. 
i couldn’t remember. it took me a good 10 seconds to bring up a picture in my head that i took of him. if i try to imagine him in my head i can really only picture his mouth but everything else is a blank slate, slender man style.

I then got up and it felt like I was blacking in and out, i was walking in circles and just felt… off. My boyfriend told me to go wet a rag and put it on my head and so i did and when i looked into the mirror my image was fine but in my head it felt distorted- like i looked almost uncanny. I started freaking out yet again and ran back into my room, falling to the floor, i ended up hitting myself multiple times throughout this whole thing (which i’ve done before) but then as i glanced at my door in which i was sitting in front of i started freaking out. like losing my shit. i was convinced someone was there, like someone was standing outside of my door waiting for me, i was absolutely convinced. I started frantically walking backwards, pinning myself to the corner of my room just staring at e door. i was freaking out worse than before and just begging for them to go away but nothing was there. then i just slowly stopped freaking out and now im 100% fine, just still unsettled.

My story (Very long but worth it I promise, I wanna give you hope)

Hey guys I wanna write my bullying and mental illness story here in case anyone feels like theyre ""weird"" or alone. It started in 7th grade as my face was breaking out badly  and the person I liked was friends with everyone except me. 


Fastforward to 15, christmas day 2004 a literal mental illness bomb in my brain goes off for no reason and the worst emotions and what if scenarios show up outta nowhere and March 2005 Im in a hospital. Do they help? Well yea but by overmedicating me to the point I sleep 2 years of my life away and gain 70 pounds

Now 17: I get the right meds and things get a little better (All I needed was zoloft) I go back to highschool and everything is somewhat ok I guess. 

All the mental and emotional bs I decide Im gonna come off meds on my own (huge mistake) and I get so bad my what if thoughts become ""What if this WOULD have happened"" thoughts. Im imaging ""What if the person I like won a trillion dollars and gave everyone in school a million dollars except me and Im made to be the biggest loser on the planet"" and this is as a 21 year old. I cant tell anyone because it sounds absolutely ludicrous so Im suffering in silence with thought of killing some imaginary girl who never wronged me. I get back on my meds and after bout a year or so I get better but still have annoying similar thoughts to this day. 

At 26 I have a spiritual awakening and I start feeling really good but as my ego starts to die my child hood trauma needs healing so it rises to the surfave slowly more each year. 

Im 34 and now I have a grip on thoughts as I know my ego (thoughts and self concepts and identifying as my mind and body) is an illusion and Ethan (me) was a character I played all along. Dissolving mind identification isnt easy but its so worth it and learning how to manifest things in my life has been quite fun at time.

icechew3r,too depressed for a job. what do i do?,3,1bu20ee,1,"hi. i was wondering if anybody here had thoughts on this. i (22) have very very little will and energy. i’m depressed. i doubt myself and hate myself way too often to ever get positive momentum and habits going. intrinsically, i’m not very talented anyways. i struggle to go to my classes for college or spend time on hw. when i’ve had part time jobs i’ve always become very overwhelmed and so depressed/drained that i’ve quit after a short amount of time. i’ve started to accept that i don’t think i have the minimum level of mental health to ever live a normal life or even work a job. ive always pictured myself becoming homeless one day if my parents hadn’t supported me the way they do, due to my depression. now, im wondering if this actually will be my reality. 

 so i guess my question is, is there any sort of support system for people who have poor mental health than just dying on the streets or living under the support of their parents? are there government programs? although i’m not considered disabled in a traditional sense i feel that if im not directly cared for financially i will die. it would be nice to ~not~ live w my parents but also not have to work a job, since i can’t. and yet still have enough to survive and ideally have enough entertainment/distractions to numb myself from my internal pain. my parents are old and don’t want to support me anyways, and i can’t deal w the shame of living around my family in such a mode of failure. i hope someone here can relate and give support. thx <3

Consistent_Bit6840,Am I going to be okay,5,1btukux,3,"I'm never really on reddit so idk how all of this work I just need to talk I guess?

Hi, I'm 21(f), and I've been stuck in depression for 10 long years.
Been diagnosed with BPD at 17(almost 18), it was suspected that I might be on the autistic spectrum but I didn't let them finish their diagnosis and I stopped seeing my therapist because of some pills they prescribed me, they didn't fit well with me and so I panicked and lost my trust. I've been re writing this post many times because I tend to talk about a story and then another ect ect, i'll try to make this short.

I used to be kind, sweet and so soooo gentle, a real angel, and then, trauma happened, boom, I became a terror, I didn't want to, I just got filled with a lot of hate. I feel her still in there tho, past me, it make me go insane, it's like Jeckyll and Hyde🤦🏻‍♀️ It started after I met someone very toxic, a friend, I wanted to make sure she wasn't alone like I was I wanted her to feel happy, I didn't want to leave like everyone in her life no, I wanted to take care of her like I wanted someone to take care of me, but she turned out to be very different than me, she became my bully, tormented me a lot, she ""encouraged"" me to get hurt, do dangerous things, use substances, ruined my other friendships ect, she ended being too much for me and I gave up after 4years, since we stopped talking, I feel like she destroyed me so much, a part of her left a stain on me, it flipped a switch in my brain, I do nothing all day, I'm grumpy, I enjoy being mean sometimes, I'm lazy, I used to drink a looot of alcohol but I stopped (🎉)and I ruin every relationships I have ect, family, friendship, love, love is the fkin worst tho, because the other part of me love it SOOO much its almost disgusting! I just want to be left alone now, I could crawl into a cave with books and I'd be fine forever, but no, I also want to be a social butterfly, with lots of good friends and the most romantic partner! I want to see the world and meet interesting people on my way, but no, I want to stay quiet in my room, all day, all night, playing games or read books, live in my fantasy world but no, I want to be an artist, do a little bit of everything, but no, I want to lay in bed and cry instead. Did I lose any sense of logic ? I feel like I'm literally going insane and that I am aware of it, im seeing my mind slipping away from sanity while I'm not able to do anything about it and I don't even know if I really want to, I don't know who's me anymore? When I become toxic and mean it make me feel kinda good in some way, satisfying, but something else come crushing that feeling down and then I feel 7 again and I don't wanna make mommy cry I don't want to make anyone cry, I don't want to say mean things, I don't want to hurt people, then I get sensitive, I cry and hold my chest tightly as it aches in pain, these switch of emotions/personality happens everyday, I'm always stuck between two opposite ""me"".

ANNND I've made it long again and I'm so tired that I don't even want to bother fixing this shit that I just wrote, I have too many thoughts at once🤦🏻‍♀️ I'm desperate ngl, lately I've been feeling like disappearing so I won't feel the burden I leave on others. 
I should probably stop there, I have so much to say, so much trauma, so many stories it all mush together making a mess like this ^ anyway... 

Am I going to be okay? Or, what can I do to be okay?

untitled_SusHi,I have a friend who acts like a child,3,1btsey2,4,"I'm not asking for help to change her or anything, but I want to understand her better. 

She's almost 22. She's my childhood friend and has always been very strange but in a good way, and it still is today. I don't wish to change her, but as people grow, people mature. And though some parts of her personality is mature. Most of the time, or 80% of the time, it's like she stays like a 12 year old.

And before people begin to ask, no, I'm not attracted to her in any way. But these qualities she has make her cute and make me want to spoil her. And it's not just me, almost all of us.

So, anyways, the bottom line. Do you think she's got some sort of mental illness? I'm not trying to self diagnosis her, but today, I just thought. What the hell? Why not ask reddit?

_____


Here's some points about her (it's going to be long so I could explain it well)

> She's got a driving license, and I don't. She can drive us (with a bunch of friends) anywhere, even for 2 hours. She absolutely loves driving.



> Her imagination is wild. She tells me and remembers every single detail in it. It blows away my mind. But her dreams are rather fairytale like. Like a storybook.



> She's super friendly. She loves hugging people and introducing herself... like a child in the way. ""Hi! My name is ----. And I am <insert name>'s friend"". Sometime,  she randomly goes up to people and compliments them, and introduces herself.



> She finds it hard to understand romance. She gets inquisitive when people break up. She goes asking them ""why?"" or ""why do people do that?"", ""why do people break up easily"" or ""why can't you still be friends with each other?"". Like in a childlike tone.



> She has never dated and doesn't find anyone attractive, so we think she's probably asexual. But at the same time, she likes mangas and romance genre, too. She finds them ""super cool and cute"". When we tell her what guy (or gurls) she likes, she says ""one that likes animals"". I mean, anyone could pass for that. We had her make a list of quality of a guy she'd like, and she found that hard. But when we told her almost everyone in our friend group would like animals, she wrote ""must have a driving licence"" as part of her list LMAO. Which none of us has.



> She only likes anime and cartoon shows. She likes movies with real acting only if its fantasy or when a group of people watches it with her. Other than that, she has no interests other than singing or when other people inspire her. Also she sings exactly like a child does. Hard forced and funny. And quite high. Karaoke is funny with her around. And sometimes she's unexpectly good but others she trips really off tune which is normal but very obviously shes having fun and it brings me to the next point.



> She isn't or doesn't seem insecure about anything at all. She randomly tells people faults. And compliments people off the bat. And when shes angry, she gets angry but doesnt use bad words. Like ""You are a bad person. I wont say those words because I'm an adult"". She stresses the fact that shes an adult all the time. But she's short so it makes it funnier. 



> She doesn't mind it (mostly) when people treats her like a child. She tells me that she gets ""points"" from them. So she is aware of how she acts. But a part of me thinks sometimes that she isn't aware. Yet sometimes she can give really heartfelt advices. The gap is really strange.



> She likes emojis and gives it to everyone she talks to on the phone and gets peoples contact easily but still never uses her phone for chatting. She doesn't have social media. She only uses the phone for youtube or singing. Shes really loud when she talks too.


> Her manner of talking really hits me off. I can keep talking about it. It really gets people to treat her like a child. And she likes exactly stuff a child would like. Like rubber ducks, hairbands, stuff toys, and collecting ketchup. She is a mess with make up too. She enjoys attention and likes getting headpats or praised. And getting treats, like a dog. I've asked if she's a furry even. Fk she even doesn't know a lot of words or shes told me ""pretends"" that she doesnt know a lot of bad words to ""manipulate people"". Yet sometimes I know she genuinely doesnt know it. 



> She has many imaginary friends. And she talks randomly to them when she's alone mostly. She really enjoys her own company. And laughs alone in her room when singing. 



> She jumps on the spot sometimes and runs around and makes some kind of random noises like screams her emotions. Like ""YAY!"", ""I'm so happy!"" And ones I heard her recently when shes doing chores. ""I DID IT!"", ""Bed. Check. Dishes. Check. Hairbrush. Check"". And she likes praises like ""<her name> is the best"". She's absolutely plain random , but sometimes, she can be really predictable (like she named her stuff toy puppy ""puppy"" and her teddy ""teddy""). You can not tell what she's thinking. But she's really good in logic stuff like coding. And shes pretty good in piano its strange to see her focus and calm when playing live in front of us.

> Sometimes she says she doesnt know how to act in certain situation so her first response to whatever the situation is is to be happy and stay positive. Because it ""likely works"" in most situations no matter which one. So she says. She has difficulty speaking stuff she wants to say effectively so she says it as if she's feeling it. For example, like if she had somrthing like a fever, she would say something like ""My head hurts. My head is hot but its cold. I'm sleepy"". But because she doesn't know the right terms, she's convinced she never feels stress or anything like that. Also she actually has like a sort of delay when you say something. Like she's processing stuff. And when she knows a term that is definitely something off her vocab, I'm like ""wtf you know that word? Well done!"" lol



Sometimes, I would need to explain to her the same way I would do to a child slowly and easily because she can't understand hard words and long sentences. We have to talk to her in her own childlike language to get her to understand something complex. And shes really fast at learning when she gets the hang of things. But there are some stuff she will never get unless she really practices it really hard and gets a habit of remembering. Like other peoples faces or names and geography.

Firm_Sea_9907,tw: what if i made someone feel su*cidal and attempt,1,1btwuy5,0,"I am 18 years old (F). I am struggling with Real event ocd. Today I remembered how bad person that i was when i was in highschool.
There was this girl who I will call B .I used to talk but things got complicated and a situation  happened (I'm still not sure of what happened) so I kind of told our other classmates what she was saying. There was this particular girl which I will call her C. C used to really bother me, she would act really mean. I would talk about C with B. Then after some time C and I've become friends and I really loved her. However B still talked behind her back but I didnt participate in it since C was my friend now, I told B that I didnt think that way etc. Then one day I learned that B told someone what I've been saying behind their back. Im still not sure about this event because B says she didnt say much but there is not much possibility of the other person knowing it without B telling them. So I got mad because it caused me some problems, I told about some of our classmates what she was saying about them. I didnt know that C was going to talk to her about it but she did that. My close friend kind of git into an argument with B. Everything become really complicated and in the end B changed her class. this all happened 2 and half years agom Today when I remembered all that I feel really bad and guilty. B and I used to talk about our mental health also, I was in really fucked up head space, I was self harming. I was attempting suicide, I was really suicidal. B also said couple of times that she wantd to die. Now that I'm thinking about all thede stuff I know I broke her heart and hurtedbher really much. But what bothers me most is what if I wanted her feel more suicidal? What if she wanted to kill herslef because of me? What if she attempted something like that? She came to school the day after when this event hallened but that still doesnt mean maybe she didnt attempt something. I honestly cant live myself with this. This whole situation is really messed up. I am really a horrible person. i feel so guilty about all that. i honestly dont know how to continue my life with that.",1712059014.0,
Human_Acanthisitta42,"I don’t think any of this is real, am I actually alone? ",6,1btns5p,6,"I’m not sure why I’m making this post if I genuinely believe this or think this is true, but since yesterday afternoon I’ve started to wonder and slowly become convinced that I’m currently living inside/being kept inside a simulation as the only truly conscious creature. And that everyone else, all of you, don’t actually exist. I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone, can’t speak with anyone, cause they’re all just parts of this simulation and whoever/whatever is keeping me here will just constantly deny it to keep me obedient and stuck here. I feel so alone, so scared, I can’t even talk to the people I care about or love because I don’t think they’re real people or they’re just trying to keep me from escaping or realizing. I started to wonder this a couple days ago when I thought I was laying in bed, and with my arm in front of me for some reason I could have sworn I saw my entire vision go black in front of me before I moved my arm.  

I don’t even know why I’m typing this, I’m so scared. I’m trying to sort my thoughts and explain the things I’m hearing/seeing but my brain just keeps running blank. I tried to “focus” on escaping, and It felt like the atoms of my body were moving or vibrating. My vision is more blurry afterwards, I heard robotic sounds, I keep seeing flashes of another place or I think I do. I’m not sure if I’m actually seeing it or if I’m just thinking I see it and convincing myself I am. I don’t trust anyone around me, cause I think they are all just vessels for the “administrator” of my simulation. AND EVERYTIME I TALK, I SPEAK, OR I TRY TO THINK ABOUT THIS, I GET SOME RANDOM NOTIFICATION FROM SOMETHING OR HEAR A NOISE OUTSIDE OR FROM ONE OF MY FAMILY. LIKE THEY’RE TRYING TO DISTRACT ME. I don’t know why I’m posting this, cause by my logic you are all also supposed to try and distract me and keep me here. But I know if I am not actually in a simulation, and I’m actually existing in a real place.

 I’m having some kind of psychotic break. I’m so scared that I’m actually alone, nobody else is real. Everyone I love, care about, my friends, they’re all fake. And they’re acting weird. Like they are what I think they are, THEY KNOW I KNOW THEY AREN’T REAL. BUT THEN AGAIN, THAT WOULD MAKE EVERYONE ELSE THAT TOO. I DONT KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I have these random moments where my brain “comes too” and asks why am I thinking this? This is crazy, this is stupid, but I feel like those are just thoughts put in by whoever is keeping me here for some reason. I feel like my reality is constantly shifting/changing out of the corners of my eyes. I think I see people, faces, Idk. IDK. IDK. LET ME OUT OF HERE. IM SO SCARED, I DONT KNOW IF THE WORLD IS REAL OR NOT.

KonradFreeman,Final Straw,1,1btvup4,0,"I live in an AirBNB. I get along great with the guy that was living here already and his cat and my cat get along. Then this guy moves in that is staying in an AirBNB because he is trying to move to Austin from California and is from the NE.

The first thing he says to me is that my cat smells. After that it was just one thing after another and every day he would bug me about the smell of my cat.

Turns out he is just really controlling and he tries to control everything and is obsessed with order and cleanliness. He uses way more products in the bathroom than any girl I have met. He is short and has a Napoleon complex, which probably explains why he tries to force his will on everyone. Real little dick energy. It gets tiring.

So he goes in my room while I am at work and goes through my stuff. 

That was the final straw. He asked if he could go in my room to open a window because the cat smells while I was at work. I told him no. He did anyway and then moved things around in the room.

So now I am pissed and I hate him.

It is all I think about is how much I hate this person.

The real final straw was the fact that he complains to the house owner about my cat's smell and now the owner is asking me to find a new place, which I do not have.

Everything was fine until he moved in.

I tried being this person's friend, but honestly they are not the type that I would want as a friend. They are really superficial and make fun of others all the time, which is more of a frat bro scene than anything I am comfortable with. He is really racist and out of touch with people that are less well off than himself. I am white too, so he thinks it is ok to be racist and look down on the minorities, but what he doesn't know is that for the last 7 years before this all my friends were black and brown and all my white friends abandoned me because I was too below them.

He thinks he is bipolar because he has only been getting 5 hours of sleep every night. He is an idiot. He uses the word ""fire"" way too much and it makes him sound like an idiot.

He has not seen me lose my shit. When I get really angry I scream and yell which usually gets the police called because of how insane it gets.

When I moved in this house I thought I was the most clean I had ever been. I came from a very horrible environment and I was so happy to live in a clean house and I took good care of myself. Then this guy with his 20 bath products and sensitive nose comes in and calls me dirty and makes fun of me. I will never be white enough for the whites anymore.

I don't feel any connection to the culture of judgemental whites I came from. I hate how superficial they are.

Yes I am racist, against whites, which I am white, so that is fine right? I like black and brown people way more than most white people. That makes me racist I guess.

It is just hard for me to relate to people that do not understand what the rest of the world outside of their fraternity is like.

So what should I do?

I want to stay here. One time I drove out a roommate through using psychological manipulation. I don't want to do that, it gets ugly.

I have been really depressed lately.

I cry every day, but I have to hide it. That is why I stopped taking passengers and just do deliveries now. No one wants to ride with a sad driver.

I am just really depressed and angry.

Go ahead and make fun of me just like everyone else does. I will never be clean enough. Forever unclean.

The KKK people I grew up with would disown me because I dated a black woman.

The KKK people went on to go to fraternities.

I hate them so much. They make fun of me. I hate them so.

Littlelouie23,I don’t know where else to go please help me,1,1btry45,1,"I don’t know where else to go

Hi I’m not really sure where else to go or who else to ask but I’ve basically been going through it. 

For the last almost 6 months I have been making so many mistakes and I don’t know why. It honestly feels like I can’t stop myself, if that makes sense. Like I’m just watching myself over and over again do things that are definitely not my thing and it’s caused a lot of pain to so many around me and myself included. 

The worst was a few months ago, I unfortunately did the worst thing ever and cheated on my long term boyfriend. It wasn’t physical but there were a lot of texts exchanged and as soon as I thought my boyfriend would leave me (after he found out) it got physical which obviously meant he left.  Now I’ve taken accountability and I feel like the most disgusting and horrid person to ever exist so please hold off on telling me that.  I hate myself enough for everyone. 

It felt like about 2 weeks ago is when it finally clicked what happened. It’s like I was suddenly me again and had to deal with everything that’s happened. I haven’t stopped crying and hurting myself and having the worst suicidal thoughts. But while everything was happening and even after I felt numb and out of control. 

In the months leading up to it I was experiencing a lot of stress. I did so many things that are out of character for me. I smoked, tried so many drugs, vaped and eventually cheated. Anyone who knew me before this would know that’s not like me at all. But for some reason I couldn’t stop any of it. It felt like it wasn’t me making the decisions. 

I had been under a lot of stress. My grandma was in hospital and was extremely sick. She eventually passed away. I went to work like nothing happened and I never took time off to grieve with my family (even though I wanted to, it just felt like again I wasn’t able to make that choice). Started falling in with the wrong crowed and eventually started experimenting with drugs. I got a few piercings (anyone who knows me would know that’s bad as I have an extreme fear of needles). I was constantly getting in trouble at work and being yelled at. I started yelling back at anyone who would even look at me weird when I was out. I was honestly the worst person ever. I then let someone give me attention I craved for and ruined my relationship with someone I was so deeply in love with. And I couldn’t stop it. Even when he found out I just was numb. It felt like nothing was real so it didn’t matter. But it finally clicked and I’m finally back and have to deal with all the shit I’ve done and it’s all too much. 

What have I done? Is it all my fault or is my mental health just really bad? I’m not blaming anyone but myself but I need to know if I get help will this happen again? Is there anyway my boyfriend could ever forgive me and take me back?

I’ve been reading about depersonalisation and it honestly seems like what I’ve gone through but I just don’t understand how it would have gotten so bad and if it’s even possible for such bad things to happen when in an episode. Can they even last that long?

Throwaway1262004,BF refuses to hear about his sister mental health issues and leaving me to deal with them and my own.,2,1btn1gq,0,"This is a throwaway and might be a bit long. 

I 19/F am currently living alone and in college. I have struggled with mental illness since I was about eight. Since then I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, anxiety, childhood PTSD, and suicidal thoughts. I’ve had a few attempts in past but mostly have just self harm. I’ve been dating my bf 21/M for almost two years and he’s been there for me most of the time. 

A few months ago his sister 16/F told him about how she’s been having depression and suicidal thoughts. After this he came over and was almost crying as he says it’s too much for him to worry about both of us. Since then I’ve mostly pulled away from talking to him about my issues since I don’t want to upset him. He then refused to hear about his sister mental health issues so she would text me instead.  Almost everyday she’ll text me about her thoughts or when she first self harmed and I’ve tried my best to help; but it’s gotten hard to try help her when I’m struggling to keep myself alive. I’m scarred that if I can’t help myself how can I help her and what happens if I can’t and his family blames me. My bf is one of my best friends, but when I need to talk about this or how much it’s affecting me he refuses to hear it if it concerns his sister. I’ve also had to help her when on vacation with friends or family whom I rarely see. 

This makes me so frustrated since it’s like he’s leaving it all on me and he won’t help me. I’ve tried to talk to him but he shuts me down saying he rly can’t handle it. It’s put a strain on our relationship and I’ve been thinking maybe should breakup so he doesn’t have to worry about both of us. 

**TL;DR;** :Struggling with own mental issues and bf sister confided she has her own. BF refuses to hear about her issues and now I’m trying to talk her in to staying alive almost everyday, while trying to keep myself alive. ",1712023777.0,

gob-stop-me,I get dreams about being SA'ed when I'm really stressed,1,1bto87z,2,"This has happened explicitly at least 3 or 4 times, someone I know like my brother or a male classmate r@ped me in a dream.

Other times there was just a random guy I didn't know walking at a fast pace towards me and as soon as he got ahold of me (neck, torso, arm) I tried to scream and fight but no sound came out and I was too weak.

This usually happens during especially stressful times in my life... 😅 and what the fuck? because it obviously doesn't help at all.

I've blocked out a LOT of memories so I'm honestly not 100% sure if I've ever been SA'ed, but to my knowledge nothing like that has happened.

Although, since I was very little my mom constantly told me stories of children, especially girls getting kidnapped, r@ped and murdered almost daily.

I was never allowed to go out by myself until I got myself a job when I was 14, almost 15, and even then I never went anywhere else alone until I was almost 17.

Now I'm 17, and I'll be 18 in 3 months, and I'm fucking terrified.

How am I supposed to function as an adult if I can't even go anywhere besides work by myself without breaking down in fear?

I have plans to get a service dog for this and various other reasons, but that won't happen immediately; and I know it's not a permanent solution.

Why am I getting assaulted in my dreams? Why is my brain forcing me to face my biggest fear in such a grueling way?

I'm so fucking lost and I feel helpless. I hate relying on people, how am I supposed to always be asking my friends to come out with me to go to things like appointments and grocery shopping?

I'm now in 10th grade. From 1st to 8th grade, I never left the top 5. I was smart, responsible, smiley, and I always got a lot of praise for my outputs and intelligence.

 9th grade: I was doing fine at first until I started being friends with these people and I don't know why but they ruined me. Everything went crashing down and everything changed. My academic performance got bad, I changed the way I talk, act, and dress, I started cutting classes, I got into situations that made me and my mom fight a lot and until now, I'm still suffering from it (I was so traumatized and now, I get anxious whenever her tone changes because I feel like she's mad at me again. Any argument with my mom, no matter how mild, makes me severely depressed and suicidal.)

9th grade, summer break: I started setting goals, I wanted to start fresh, I wanted to be a brand new person. I wanted to study harder to take back what I lost from 9th grade. 

10th grade: things seemed to be okay at first. I was studying REALLY REALLY hard (I can't stress this enough), I was participating in class and always got high scores on quizzes and exams, my academic performance was great for like 2 months and then BOOM. Mental illness. Until now, I still haven't gotten my will to live back.

This only happen very recently, the thought creeped up and won't go away.

I want to just live in now and have fun and even work feels like a waste of time like I should cut hours to do more. My schedule is very mixed up so maybe I should request early/late hours and no weekends to help.

I'm going to a convention; I want to save money to transition but I want to have fun too . I was so close but am short due to spending, but I bought a new laptop o do streams and have fun.

I might write down stuff down to help. When I think about writing I also think about looking back on it in the future for some reason? That's a long way away. I think about turning 30 at 23 and I can still do stuff at 30 tho. I turn 24 this year.

itssaulgood_man,Emotionally absent parents?,3,1bt4n5t,2,"Hey there! I’ve been dealing with several mental disorders like anorexia, social anxiety, depression and possibly others for over a decade now, so since my childhood. I’ve been doing therapy for over a decade and am slowly starting to uncover the origin of my issues. It’s difficult because on the surface it looks like I grew up in a stable household. My parents have never physically abused or harmed me and yet I feel like something in the way I grew up made me develop these disorders to cope better. Last night I was thinking that I’ve always felt alone when I was a child. I’m an only child, my mom has been a stay at home mom ever since I was born and my dad worked, if he didn’t he was busy drinking (alcoholic, now sober) or pursuing his own hobbies, mainly biking. So he was always gone. My mom was seemingly always there and I definitely had a better connection with her, simply because she was somewhat present, but she had some sort of compulsion to always clean and do the chores. So when I needed her, even when I was very suicidal, she was more worried about her cleaning and her “schedule” getting off track. Even when I was in clinics they rarely came to visit me and even today as I don’t live with them anymore, they don’t come to visit me. When I take the time to visit them it’s like it’s always been: they do their own shit as before. No in-depth talks, no questions about my studies or me at all. They claim that if they asked they’d get weird reactions from me, which might be because I’m not used to getting asked personal questions from them. Basically they blame me for the way they behave. All they ever talk about is gossip, badmouthing my cousins and generally showing more interest in other people’s lives than mine. So I’ve always felt kind of lonely and do to this day. I don’t know if you would call this “emotionally absent parents”, feel free to tell me in the comments. My theory is that I developed anorexia to get some sort of attention. I also compulsively focus on my school or uni work (to the point of burnout) to get attention for my achievements. But it’s not really gotten me anywhere.


Sometimes I  find myself rejecting this theory and thinking “my parents didn’t do anything wrong”, “I didn’t have it that bad”, “I’m just sensitive”, etc. Because I wasn’t physically abused or anything like that. I guess my question is if anyone has been in a similar situation and experienced similar feelings, to maybe confirm my theory and not feel so alone for once. Now I know you don’t know the whole story so it’s probably hard to say anything about it but any sort of advice, recommendations on how to deal with it etc. would be very welcome and appreciated!",1711980455.0,
InteractionOk5489,Self diagnosis and misinformation,2,1bta8vi,1,"Hey everyone, first of all, I´d like to introduce myself, I'm a design student currently working on her thesis. Lately, I´ve encountered myself with plenty of self-diagnosis-oriented ***TikToks*** and ***Reels***, as well as posts filled to the brim with generalizations and misinformation. This has been bringing a lot of frustration to me, as I have been diagnosed with ADHD since I was about 12 Y/O, and Anxiety since 18 Y/O, (I´m currently 23 Y/O). Last semester I was talking to someone at my university, and bc of the time of day, I had to take my ADHD and Anxiety medication, this person asked me about them (I´m very open about my mental illnesses, but I still think it´s overstepping if u don´t really know the person but whatever). I told them what they were, and they said, I have ADHD too! in a very excited way, so I asked, when they were diagnosed, bc I personally find it very useful to share personal experiences on the subject, i was shocked when they told me they were diagnosed by a TikTok they saw... I was extremely upset but kept it to myself. Since then it has really stuck with me the idea of how harmful it is for EVERYONE, self-diagnosis, for starters I feel like it minimizes the illness by being something you can realize yourself by seeing a ***TikTok***, instead of going to a professional for a diagnosis (and struggling with it all your life), and also the fact that if you do self diagnose, it doesn't mean you will get proper treatment... most people use it as an excuse, as a way to fit in, or even bc it´s ""trendy"" or aesthetic.

After all, that rumbling I wanted to ask for a favor from the community, My thesis is based on the effect social media can have on self-diagnosis and hypochondria, so if you could share in the comments of this post, about your own experiences and or even linking other posts, reels, tiktoks, or whatever you think is relevant to study I would greatly appreciate it, this is all for academic research. If you feel comfortable sharing it would mean a lot to me.

Thing is, I and doing all this but have no control over my body. It has gotten better now but whenever I talk about it or even think about it my heartbeat increases. I get cold. Even now. What is it? It is a fear of numbers. Rather a fear of how small things can be. How small I am. A fear of infinity. A fear of everything around me being divided into squares infinite in nature where everything and every thought I have both did and did not exist. Even me thinking this and choosing to write did or did not happen. Or maybe other variations. I see trains coming in but It's cutting everything in its way or maybe not. It is large and as it gets to me it goes through the world and everything in its way either exists or not. I don't know. Something happens to it. Things start to zoom out. I zoom out. Its all third person and I'm so small/ I'm so dizzy. There is so much I want to type but can not. Its too much to type. Too infinite. or maybe not. Every text I wrote I could have made a typo and so on and so forth. Again, infinite. I need to stop thinking of this. I think I am the only person in this world that will even understand this. It scares me thinking nobody else will ever know what this is. It's crazy. I don't think I am crazy. Its all so scary. I'm 18, going on 19 and its all still so scary. So vast. So big. So....

FFSIA,Please help or tell me what to do.,2,1bt76l8,1," Hello, now I am in a neglected and bad condition, I live in apathy and constant fear, not knowing what to do to live peacefully further. Right away I want to say that it is problematic for me to go to the hospital and I hardly dare to do it for the next 3-4 months, for a lot of problems and fear.  
The thing is that for about a year I have been living in some kind of hell, my body and mind behave extremely strange. In addition to the above fear and apathy, I also have symptoms in the form of intrusive thoughts - In the form of a sudden desire to either kiss a sudden stranger or on the contrary to hit him. Pressure in the head - A feeling as if something presses in the area of the top of the head on the left, it is also in a piggy bank of incomprehensible sensations in the head, also I feel as if this body does not belong to me as well as I am not in this reality. About intrusive thoughts I would like to add that I hold myself back, but this restraint puts some unpleasant pressure on me. Sometimes I wanted to scream, either from the pressure or just my mind wanted it, but I also had to hold back and suffer.  
I often have problems with ""falling out of reality"", most often it happened after playing games (I play a lot of computer games, 8 hours approximately) - when I get away from the computer it's like I can't fully perceive the real life, it seems like I'm in a place unknown to me and everything around is alien, which is definitely scary.  
So, all this baggage has been tormenting me for a long time...I'm wondering if anyone can give advice on what it could be and how I can get rid of this horror? (Well, or explain it's all related to one disease or is it all different diseases?). Thank you for your attention.

P.S. Oh, and I want to add that I already tried not to play and not to sit at the computer in general, the condition did not improve after that, so unfortunately it's something more serious than just eye strain.  
I also want to add that I have a problem with sleep for quite a long time, I wake up very often at night.

Willfangirl,I looked it up and what I’m describing has no name or classification,1,1btd4ol,0,"So I’m currently 17 y/o and I’ve recently been seeing lots of attention on ‘demon face syndrome’

Essentially what i experienced though was as I would look at a persons face or their eyes for longer than a few minutes without breaking line of sight, their face would start to almost morph into something unrecognizable. previously when I held a stare for too long I would see their skin age and lose colour, almost wither, it was like I could see what they’d look like if they were dead (not claiming that’s what it is obviously I’m just giving an example to help better understand) it’s hard to accurately describe to give a visual picture but essentially it was like seeing them decompose, from what I’ve found it’s not person specific, more so time related with how long I’d look at them, if they were in constant movement it wouldn’t really happen or if I blinked or look away it would work the opposite (if that’s confusing from the wording I mean their face would start to go back to or stay ‘normal’) I looked it up extensively and there’s not really any classification or research based on this so I thought as a last resort I’d reach out to Reddit and see if anyone has any thoughts or similar experiences

Independent-Bit5881,ADHD or more?,1,1bsqb05,2,"Here's a run down of my mental health history. Im looking for some opinions/insight.

My mom had me when she was 19. My dad came into the picture when I was 2. She's never been affectionate, but has always taken care of me. My early memories are of me playing alone. I never saw my parents act like they liked each other. Never saw them fight either. They got divorced when I was 7. I felt nothing. I felt disconnected from them. Like no one cared. Around 10 I got overwhelmingly depressed. I picked up habits, such as pulling out my eyebrows/eyelashes, to the point of people noticing. I felt like I needed to clench my muscles in patters repeatedly. Not sure why. I would lock and unlock doors, not believing that I actually locked it the first time. (This still happens now, last Thanksgiving, I knew I double checked that I unplugged my curling iron, but I panicked the whole dinner, convincing myself I had left it on and that I was going to come home to a burnt house).

Around this age I also started self harming. I would c\*t and b\*rn myself. This is continued for many years. Around age 12 I emotionally clung onto a boy for dear life. We talked 24/7, it was super toxic and very obsessive. I would have panic attacks over him constantly. I based my value on our relationship. It was insane behavior for someone that age. I continued seeing this boy until the tenth grade when my parents found out about a self harm incident and forced me to move cities to get away from him. I think I clung to him because I didn’t feel like I was loved in any other part of my life.

Over the years I would constantly question what was different about me. I felt as though I didn’t perceive things the way others did. I felt like I never really fit in, it was hard to make friends, and still is. I can be social and talkative once Im comfortable with someone, but day to day interactions freak me out. I can’t look at peoples faces in public, but if im comfortable I stare people directly in the eyes during the whole conversation. Im constantly feeling naive to social situations that most people seem to already have figured out. I’ve always gone through hyperfixation phases, whether it’s eating the same food everyday for months, or listening to the same song on a loop for days straight. I have a history of having really strong emotional reactions to minor events if im overstimulated, but other times I am extremely patient.

Im 22 now. The older I get, the more confused I get on what is going on with me. Ive gotten more impulsive. Ive done a lot of research, made many comparison charts and lists to try to narrow it down. I spent time in an outpatient facility when I was 17 for one of my strong emotional reactions, and they told me I had severe ADHD, but my parents and I did not believe that at the time. I didn’t know anything about it then. Now that ive done more research, it makes sense, but also doesn’t seem like it covers everything. I am leaving out so many details, but Im hoping someone can relate to something Ive said and share similar experiences.",1711932823.0,
gratefulcloudyday,How Do I Prevent My Bf From Beaking Up with Me,2,1bskac1,2,"Im 19F and Ive dated my boyfriend (19M) on and off for 2.5 years. We started dating in high school and we were each others first partner. I had a lot of issues with self destruction as I had undiagnosed bipolar 2 and bpd and a history of anorexia and self harm addiction. I am qualified as mentally disabled now.

I wasnt better when we dated and I visited the mental hospital a lot. i didnt think about the consequences to my actions and I tried to hurt myself as much as possible by not thinking about my impulses. This made him worried, upset, and traumatized, but he stayed with me. 

When I was diagnosed, about 6 months into dating, I tried to turn things around but it took a lot of work. I still had trouble controlling my impulses and I would overshare. I even overshared impulsive thoughts of cheating, although it is out of character for me. 

I had constant breakdowns and panic attacks and I was needy. After a year and a half, I broke up with him on impulse, saying I felt that I might be obsessed with him and Im not sure if I love him. I didnt want to lead him on, given that I might be leading him on. Thinking about it now, I think I loved him, but I was hyperfocused on him and I couldnt differentiate well. 

When we broke up, I was very upset and I ended up doing things that caused me even more trauma. I slept around and let lots of people cross my boundaries. I live with my emotionally abusive mom and it didnt help. 

I ended up trying to get back together with him 4 months later after realizing that I still loved him. I wanted to change so we could be together so I made some drastic changes. 

Im almost a year clean from self harm, I can hold a job, I communicate what is necessary but I dont overshare, and we make time for each other by posting to a schedule app when we have work and plans, then fill in the blanks with our plans. I see a therapist regularly and I have become very stable and conscious of what it means to live healthy. 

I have work to do, but I have become very mindful. I still cry a lot, as this is my normal. Crying many times a week is normal for me because I have big feelings. When I cry, I communicate why I am upset/what triggered me to him. I always talk about how I am feeling and we work through things together to find a solution. 

We have both expressed our similar paths and have talked about kids in the future. 

The only downside is that he is not very self aware and seems to hold on to past trauma, which I dont blame him for. He is very rigid and stuck in bad habits, like making jokes that make me upset or using tone with me.

I have expressed my needs for him to watch his tone and treat me more like a girlfriend than a ""bro"" but I have patience. He says every time I tell him off, he feels like he is doing something wrong. He is constantly adding up all his wrongs and now when I tell him off for something small, he gets very down and goes on about how ""he can never get it right""

I explain that he is just very stuck in his ways, but he needs lots of reassurance, which I dont mind. He provides me the same, so I should make it 50/50.

Today, he told me after church that he wasnt sure how he felt about us, with teary eyes. He broke down and had a panic attack. I helped him calm down and tried to figure out what was wrong. He said he has been so stressed and says he isnt sure if he can handle the normal that is us (me crying all the time, periodic episodes of mania/euphoria/depression).

 He acknowledged my change and told me he is grateful and proud, but told me he isnt sure about how he feels. He mentioned his coworker that he has brought up before. His coworker, a lady, has been kind of flirty or over friendly with him. When he mentioned her, I asked that he make it clear he has a girlfriend, but I dont mind them talking. I knew about this for a week or so, which is how long theyve been chatting. 

He said in the car today that when he speaks to her, he feels refreshed. I think he meant to explain this as, speaking to someone more normal than I am is refreshing or relieving. He then said he felt upset, because he didnt want to be a cheater for talking to her. He said it doesnt help that she is his type.

He kept crying and I calmly reassured him that chatting is not cheating. I noticed that he might be feeling how I did last year when I broke up with him. I was not only hyper focused on him, but I wanted to experience dating other people. 

I tried to understand him although I was upset. I remained calm and did not cry. He explained that his sister and best friend advised him to weigh the pros and cons of breaking up with me or not. His sister also told him that his mom does not like us dating which made him feel more unsure. 

I dont like his mom. Controlling and a complainer. Thats all I have to say. 

I want my boyfriend to stay with me but I dont know what i can do. I gave him options.. likr we can take a break or break up. Or we can try to fix things so he is less stressed. I told him to go date other people if he wants to, calmly. I told him to decide in as much time as he needs. I hugged him and told him I loved him. He told me he loves me too and that this is really hurting him.

 I couldnt focus for the past few hours though. I feel so abnormal and teary. We are going to chat more later but I want to know how I can get him to stay with me.

My inner world is true chaos, conflict and despair After some heavy experiences over an year ago I just cracked, I was then facing events that  were just re-traumatising, and it didn’t let up. I can’t even count the number of times, I felt reality just slide out of focus, my soul just leaving my body sometimes, feeling like a shell. My identity just smashed to pieces, not myself anymore what ever that even was. I got some counselling and they taught me about CPTSD and structural dissociation. I discovered there’s all these different people and parts, they are familar to me but it makes me feel so crazy even coming on Reddit to talk about it  worrying that I’m just losing my mind, and ‘I’ don’t exist. People and parts showing up day to day that tbh if I was in a better mental place, I wouldn’t want exposed to/be seen, (wrong time, people, Place etc) I’ve noticed the feeling/symptoms feelings that tend to happen before I ‘switch’ and want to know if anyone has felt anything similar.

There tends to be a rush of sickness, and chills, sometimes I can feel my body fill up with discomfort and it like pushes ‘my’ self out to the edges or to one side or out of myself like I’m not in control of my speech or body anymore just a bystander watching myself. Sometimes I can control or at least hold it away/down in my stomach. If I go inwards to face it, or lose out, get full on body rush, little twitches, very intense in the brain/head like an ‘overload’ feeling. Then when I return I’m just a bit different, more capable? Or like the complete opposite, ‘stuck on’ but like don’t have good access to like higher thinking & memories. Suddenly act like a different person but it is me, a different version of me. —— I don’t get to choose when it happens like that, just now know when I disassociate/get that body sensations combination I could ‘switch’ to a diff me or have emotional/body flashback.

I want to deny its this bad, only because I fear telling people what’s going on with me will make them reject or become scared of me.

My mom had to call him and try to talk some sense into the kid but we are both concerned. He is so isolated that it seems he’s created his own world view through the lense of religion. Along with wanting to live in complete isolation with this religion thing, I reckon the anxiety is a symptom of some type of personality disorder.

EmuNo1948,Is my new psychologist right for me?,1,1brwgd2,2,"I started seeing a new psychologist recently after moving cities. I don't know though, I've been feeling worse after the sessions. 

My previous psychologist was good, I would even look forward to the sessions. Get stuff off my chest and gain some insight into my feelings etc.  They would make me see myself in a kinder light. It was comforting. But I didn't really feel like we made much progress. They weren't very proactive and sometimes I felt like they forgot key things. While they were good in many ways, the relief felt very temporary for the most part and  I never really dealt with my core issues. Never learnt new coping mechanisms, never worked through my trauma.

My new psychologist is direct but even kind of stern. They have a plan to tackle my issues and they're proactive but sometimes I feel like I'm being reprimanded or judged. It's weird. They did say that they're direct from the beginning and I said I wanted that because I want to make real progress this time. I want honesty and someone to then walk the journey with me...but I don't know. Sometimes I feel like they're leading me to a conclusion but it's not the reality of the situation ... or my situation. I know we can say they're supposed to lead us to answers about ourselves but this feels pushy almost. But they're also good in some other ways like they knows their stuff and picked up some things about me really quickly.

My determination and desperation to get better means I am a lot more honest about the uglier side of myself and maybe I'm projecting. I was less honest with my previous psychologist because I was ashamed. 

Is this the discomfort that's expected when you're working through stuff? Should I trust the process or jump ship before my mental health gets worse?

They mentioned how direct they are so it means she's aware that it may not work for some people? 

Just for some extra context, I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, extremely low self esteem and just a ton of self loathing. I'm also just very sensitive in general but I'm someone that wants to learn and grow. This means that even if something isn't received well I always try and take something out of it.

Sweaty_County2725,Vivid auditory and visual hallucinations. Is this normal? ,1,1brv2he,2,"This usually only happens when I’ve gotten about 6 hours of sleep or less. It started last year when I just started going back in-person for school. I think they usually only last for about a minute, give or take, but in the moment they feel so so real. So, every time I’ve gotten 6 hours of sleep or less (which was always on school nights), that day in third period (it would ALWAYS happen in third period, which is after lunch if that changes anything.) I would either get a vivid auditory or visual hallucination that wouldn’t last very long. Sometimes I’d still be trying to write my notes while hallucinating, in the moment thinking my handwriting is easy enough to understand, but as soon as I’d snap out of it and look back at my notes they were pretty much unintelligible. One time, I was in class and two characters from a cartoon I watched as a child walked in to my class and just started having a conversation. I remember thinking to myself that I shouldn’t get distracted and continued to write what my teacher was writing on the board, but I couldn’t help but get distracted anyway and eavesdropped on what they were saying. I thought it was some unreleased episode and tried writing down what they were saying into my notebook for whatever reason. I snapped out of it pretty quickly and felt super weirded out by myself. How’d I believe all of that was real? Am I crazy? Another time I was in class writing notes and suddenly this weird button appeared on my page and would move back and forth continuously. I thought it was some sort of game to follow the button with my pencil. I also thought I was being rebellious by playing the game because I was trying to cover my paper with my hand since I didn’t want my teacher to see and get mad that I wasn’t writing the notes. When I snapped out of it and everything went back to normal I felt pretty weirded out with myself again. Also, by “snapping out of it” I mean I kind of like jolt up and get the sudden realization I was seeing/hearing things and that nothing was real. Another time I was writing notes and when I was done my page just started highlighting itself, I didn’t hallucinate an actual highlighter but I hallucinated the markings. It was kind of just scribbling all over my page so I got upset and tried rubbing it off. Snapped out of it and felt weirded out again. I’ll mention one more hallucination that I can kind of remember because this one was pretty weird. I don’t remember exactly what I was hallucinating, but I remember actually realizing that I was hallucinating in the middle of the hallucination. I tried making myself stop but it was like I was stuck, like I was literally telling myself that what I was seeing isn’t real and that I have to stop but it still wouldn’t (I was talking to myself in my head btw lol). I kind of just continued hallucinating and it stopped on its own accord.

This has occurred even when I’ve gotten more than 6 hours of sleep but rarely, and even then I still feel very tired. One thing that I’ve thought of is that it’s some sort of phase that’s between being awake and dreaming, because every time it happens I’m in a very sleepy state. So it’s like, I’m asleep but not quite? Like maybe my brain thinks it’s asleep but my body’s still awake. That probably doesn’t make any sense haha I just kind of made it up with no research. 

I have tried googling but can’t really find anything that fits my exact symptoms, but maybe I’m just not searching hard enough.

suppressedTh0ughts,Is this a mental illness?,0,1brp17o,2,"My sister has not held an actual conversation with my father since she was 15 years old over some misunderstanding. He scolded her, she felt misunderstood, and it was never resolved. My father can be quite a male chauvinist as well and we disagree with the way he talks to my mum - sometimes belittling her, throwing all the traditionally mother’s roles and responsibilities to her. I believe that this may have caused my sister to develop a hatred towards my dad. 

As the years passed by, I feel that things have gotten worse in terms of the way that my sister is handling her hatred towards him. These are some of the things which I find problematic:
- When we are eating out in restaurants or other food places together, my sister must not sit in front of or beside my father
- My sister and father cannot be in the same room alone together, such as the living room
- When my sister goes to the master bedroom to accompany my mother, my dad is not allowed to go onto the master bedroom. Once he tries to enter, my sister would flare up and go back into her room and slam the door. 
- My sister never uses the common toilet because my father uses it. She only uses the master bedroom toilet that my father doesn’t use. 
- My sister refuses to touch the door knob of the Master bedroom and would scold all of us if we were to try and close the door while she needs to be moving back and forth from her room to the Master bedroom toilet. We are not even allowed to close the door if she showers in the Master bedroom toilet. She can take up to an hour to shower. (I’m not sure, suspect that she thinks the door knob is dirty, or even touched by my father therefore it’s dirty?)
- During the day, if both my dad and sister happen to be at home together with some of us, there can never be a point that they walk past each other. For example, if she is using the Master bedroom toilet, my father has to stay in the living room and wait for her to come back out to the living room before he can go into the Master bedroom. If he tries to go to the Master bedroom and she happens to come out of the toilet, she will slam the toilet door and go back into the toilet, start mumbling and saying “crazy” “what the hell” “disgusting”, sometimes even grumble in frustration or scream a bit if she gets too frustrated. Another example would be that if my sister is in the kitchen, my father can NEVER enter the kitchen or she will be so mad that he starts mumbling, grumbling and shouting. If my father is in the kitchen, she would wait until he’s out before she enters. If my father is in the kitchen for too long (in her opinion) and she needs to go to the kitchen, she will start to “TSK” mumble, and grumble too…. 

If I am being honest here, I feel afraid of her sometimes because of the unpredictability she is presenting. I’m not sure when or what would potentially trigger her and cause her to react in this manner. For context as well, I haven’t been speaking to her for 9 months as well over some mild argument. I was not at fault. But she was very prideful (in my opinion) and refused to let it go so we didn’t talk and it became awkward. 

I always feel that my senses are heightened and I feel an internal sense of panic when my sister raises her voice. It has been this way since I was younger. I feel like this feeling has worsened. I feel like I am walking on eggshells at times because I’m afraid to trigger her unknowingly. I try not to do things that would cause her to shout or grunt. But being clumsy in nature, sometimes I miss certain things and it happens and I feel so panicky. 

Also, I actually hate her poor temper and how she can flare up at my mum (cancer survivor) over very small things and lose patience towards her so easily. I just hope she can be more patient towards her and not agitate my mother because I want my mother to stay physically healthy and emotionally well too.

She was her normal self up until late January 2023 when she had a bad UTI that was a hospitalized with to get cleared up.  After that she was confused  so at first we suspected it was delirium.   So we got her rechecked for the UTI, which is the only thing that made sense since the confusion came on so suddenly.  To our surprise, the UTI was gone.  We followed up with a PCP (primary care provider) and they ran a bunch of tests.  Another  checm of the urine, abdominal scans, brain ct, cognitive tests and everything came back fine. Her confusion was now turning into paranoia.   She was now saying that people were stealing her social security number from the post office, that her cell phone and home phone were connected (they werent) and if anyone tried to call the her home or cell phone it would screw up their phone too.  She could smell gas coming from her electric oven, she went to get her marriage license with her dad, not her husband.  Now she cant find her marriage license so she says shes not married.  She thinks her birth certificate has the wrong birth date on it.  She cant find a couple of her kids birth certificates  (she has 8 children) so now she doesnt really think they are hers.  The list goes on and on.  Its all very very sad.  I took her try to get help from a mental health Dr.  And she was put an an antidepressant but they knew she needed more based on her a tions etc.  They sent a referral over to a psychologist,  but couldnt get in for a month or so.  In the mean time, because she ""didnt like taking pills daily"" just took the antidepressants when she wanted to. ***she lives with her husband but at this point it was fighting an uphill battle with both***  i had to withdraw myself from the situation for my own mental health after she decided she didnt need to take the meds on a regular basis.   After that there were attempts to commit her but those were failed.  Fast forward to this January 2024, she was diagnosed with bome cancer with 3 spots found.  One on her spine, one on her hip, and the 3rd spot on the base of her skull.  She has gone thru chemo and radiation treatments and its now stable, but everyday she sits and mumbles about the stolen ssn, the issues with the phones, the marriage certificate, the missing birth certificate of her children she doesnt think are hers anymore.  From what they are telling me they have done scans of her brain so its not mets on her brain.  Her husband is in his 80s.  Shes got 7 children.  But in the hospital she named me as her emergency contact.  By no means do i want to be it.  I want to wash my hands of it because her kids should be doing research and asking questions and advocating for her.

I still live at home (21f) but my dad is a drunk and we are constantly going in circles, my mom left a couple years ago due to drug addiction and since then I’ve been helping my dad with my little brother (15, has downs) I love my brother with everything in me but my dad refuses to get help for him so i can just live my life, get a better job, go back to school whatever ya know. And recently it feels like he’s been worse with trying to point out every thing I do wrong.  I had a plan with my best friend that within a year we can move. Which would force my dad to get help and I’m hoping to at least be less sloppy with the drinking/slow down. But her bf is tired of being long distance (understandably) and is pretty much making her make a choice and I don’t want to be the reason her relationship fails bc I kept her up here longer than she needed so she’s trying to go down sooner. And it’s like my way out just exploded in front of me. I had my hopes up I was excited to be a normal young adult and work on getting the therapy I’ve needed for a while now and idk I’m back to feeling hopeless, stuck and like I’m never getting out. I don’t want to be her problem I don’t want to be anyone’s problem but I don’t think I can do it alone, I know I don’t have “the balls” to do it alone. My dad pretty much expects me to be there and work around his and my brothers schedule until he dies (he’s got some health issues and is an alcoholic yes but he’s only 49) THEN I can move and live my life. it just I don’t know I just needed to rant there’s so much going on and it goes so much deeper than what I can type, I just want to give up again.

Specifically with my partner they have expressed they do not trust me and often just would rather not talk to me. And It seems like the places that offer online therapy/counseling  is only for people who have something like depression or anxiety. Which is helpful but I do not need the therapy that focuses on uplifting myself or making myself more confident because that is part of my issue. Im not a good person that needs to feel better about myself I am a hurtful individual who needs to learn how to work with shit so I stop hurting other.  Im not even sure how to attack these problems when there doesn't seem to be resources for what I am looking for, and if there is its coming from someone who doesn't really get what theyre talking about. Another block to getting proper help is I can not pay for a service at the moment. 

Could anyone direct me to the sources that may have helped you, if you have experienced similar? Tips and help I guess.

Coach_McCoacherson,My gf is depressed and I am struggling with being drained by it,7,1bq6zzr,4,"My gf lives with OCD and depression. Both horrible things to have to deal with on a daily basis. 

It seems as though she has been in a funk for almost 2 years. Her lense through which she sees the world is very clouded. She thinks almost all people are judging her harshly, she notices negative things way more than positive things, and she complains a lot. 

She is on medication, in therapy, and is doing what she can to improve.

I have a lot of guilt saying this because I know being positive doesn’t fix mental illness, but it is becoming so draining to be around. It seems to be constant complaining, noticing things that are not how she likes them, assuming the worst of people etc. 

I am doing my best to validate her feelings while also offering another perspective, but more and more I find myself getting annoyed and frustrated with her because of her outlook. I end up snapping at her and then will blame her for being impacted by how she feels. 

I know I am responsible for my feelings and need to take space when needed. But it’s hard and I think I need more tools to deal. 

I love her so much and do not want to leave her. She is a beautiful person when she’s not being bombarded by intrusive thoughts and a lack of dopamine and serotonin. I know she can get well. I’m just really low on energy to deal. 

Would love to hear if anyone can relate or has coping strategies to share. 

Breaking up is not an option as I do not believe that mental illness is a deal breaker. I just want to learn how to support myself better and to not feel so alone in this. 

Thanks.

i feel like i have no real personality. i feel like i have no sense of humor, i don’t know how to talk to people and open up, i constantly just feel very disconnected from everyone. everyone around me makes comments all the time about how i’m too awkward and quiet. i’ve always had really low self esteem, and it’s very difficult for me to make friends with people because i feel so extremely boring, annoying, and awkward. i’m always fully convinced everyone around me hates me and that just my presence makes them feel miserable and embarrassed. i’m so hyper sensitive to every tiny thing, i take every tiny thing personally and will often sob over it all. it’s also very difficult for me to trust people, and i get very easily disappointed in everyone, which makes it very hard for me to keep and progress friendships. 

i’m 17 now, but i can remember being like this as far back as kindergarten. even way back then i was fully convinced everyone hated me, i’d go around school asking everyone if they actually liked and cared about me. kids would just straight up tell me no cause of how annoying it was that i always asked that, and i’d just go home and cry wondering what’s wrong with me. i always felt so wrong compared to everyone else, and i was so clingy people would get pissed about it. i remember i was only about 8 when i first had thoughts of wishing i was never born because i always felt so extremely burdening to everyone

it’s still very very difficult to make friends. i dont have a single childhood friend, and moved to a different school in a different state freshman year. i have friends that i’ve known for 3 years and am around every school day, yet i feel like i have no emotional bond with any of them. i genuinely dont think any of them could name a single personal detail about me. they all say im too quiet and awkward, it makes me so sad and embarrassed. i have a gf, but these issues seem to really get in the way sometimes. besides her i have almost nobody, i’m constantly terrified she’s gonna get sick and tired of me and abandon me. i worry that im so boring that i make her miserable

idekkanymoree_,How to deal with the feeling that I’m wasting mh support teams’ resources? ,1,1bqedaz,2,"So I referred myself to a local mh support team in October since I was on the brink of relapsing sh wise and was extremely suicidal. They set me up a crisis plan and wanted to arrange a meeting. However, they told my parent when I told them not to so I ignored all of their calls and emails since they broke my trust before I even met a real life individual. 

The suicidal ideologies and sh ideation doesn’t occur as much anymore, I’ve only slightly thought about it like once or twice. But it’s not permanently gone. However, I’ve felt heavily dissociated and anxious for years and years and decided to re-refer myself to a different support agency for help with that. They called me this morning and said that they have assessments open next week and to call back so I will do that tomorrow to get the assessment done.

But I feel like I’m kinda wasting their time. In the self referral form I went into detail about my struggles with not feeling real and my anxiety increasing over time. Depersonalisation and anxiety doesn’t seem as major as other people who may have suicide attempts or are in immediate danger. I  feel like others have it way worse and I’m wasting their resources. This issue is something I’ve been dealing with for like 3 years now hence why I decided to pursue help. I think I’ve done the right thing but I can’t rid the feeling that I’m wasting my time.

So recently I have been super anxious about getting schizophrenia.

I am 21.  I have ocd and anxiety.  I have no family history of mental health issues other than ocd in my fathers side.  

Basically this obsession started after a bad weed high where I was anxious and alone in my apartment.  

Since then I have been really really anxious/stressed about being in psychosis.

It has now gotten to the point where sometimes I hear voices in white noise.  For example I will hear a feminine voice in the shower or a male voice in my A/C unit.  Nothing conveying messages or clear.  I also have tinnitus so thats wonderful.  This all started after the bad high and my obsession about schizophrenia.  It tends to only happen in the presence of white noise, when I am anxious, and when I am alone in my apartment.  If I am back home, with friends, or not anxious it does not happen.  **Its not like I am actually hearing voices but my brain tries to convince me I am if I listen hard enough.**

I have been evaluated by my psychiatrist, therapist, and primary care physician.  I was exceptionally worried I **experienced cannabis induced psychosis** but I did not.  

Now my ocd has convinced me that all the stress and anxiety I am experiencing will lead to me actually triggering something in my body to getting schizophrenia and that my prior history of drug use will as well.",1711667068.0,

PsychoLittleKitten,My spouses feel I mention my bpd too much,0,1bq8l4t,1,"I spoke with my boyfriend last night that I live with and he mentioned that two of our spouses said I mention my bpd too much.

I try to explain things using things but I always apologize for anything I've done typically I'll say something like ""hey, I'm really sorry I will do my best to improve this in the future. I think that because of my bpd it caused this issue to spiral."" Just an example of something simple I am just doing my best to recognize any triggers or what caused these issues because I'm trying to identify causes and get better about how I react to everything I've only been diagnosed since 2021.

I have been doing my best at recovering and letting go of the trauma I still have from the past and every day I feel I am definitely improving especially since actually getting that diagnosis along with my diagnosis for OCD and PTSD.

They also judged that I don't sit near the partner I live with much but I feel like it makes sense to try and give my other friends and partners attention on the weekly occasions we are around them since I'm with my main partner every other day of the week that we don't see friends/partners.

And the last thing they said is that I apparently make too many mean or self depreciating jokes. My spouse only recently brought to my attention that it bothered him when I made jokes that involved him and I immediately mostly stopped sometimes I forget but it's definitely gone down at least 90-95% and I'm working to make that 100% however my self depreciating jokes don't seem like an issue to me because I'm always just playing around and it's nothing super cruel just mostly stuff like ""if I'm trash then you're obligated to take me out."" In a joking and flirty way.

It seems like the only nice things he had to tell me were that they think I'm creative and generous and that I dealt with a money issue pretty well instead of blowing up I sat myself down and calmed myself then had an important discussion.

part of my problem is me projecting these thoughts onto comfort characters and part of it is my brain trying to convince me i am one of those terrible people. like for example these characters i have some people depict them with a child and my brain did like mental gymnastics trying to sort of my thoughts. their child was grown in one of the pieces of art like literally an adult but my brain was still trying to twist it into something it was not. there was other art of them but little but in a chibi style which i thought was adorable but my brain was still being odd and making me reconsider what my views are. they aren’t that way i know that and i’m not that way.

‼️important to note‼️the reason i’m talking about these characters is because i feel that they’re all i have and if i lose this fixation then what reason do i have to go on.

i have done terrible things in my head with them (the characters, not the child) like doing a weird age gap thing with a chatbot website. i made one of them my age. maybe i thought it was fine because of my trauma with someone who was actually a pedo. i regret it and it stresses me out looking back on it. another time, i was trying to do a scenario acting as their child (made them my age), but the scenario turned into something terrible and it wasn’t the way i wanted it to go. i wanted something silly like going on outings and doing normal shit you do with family. it’s my fault it turned out that way as i should’ve tinkered with the settings beforehand to make sure it didn’t do that. unfortunately the site i use allows that shitty stuff but you can mute tags with those NSFL topics but sometimes people bypass it and it becomes distressing.

i can’t say that any compliments about the art without my brain being weird or trying to say ‘minor’ or have an image of a nude child pop of in my head it’s like they want to paint them as that and keep me away from them. 

i can’t enjoy games that have a mostly young audience because what if i do something weird like the last time i joined i was just being weird about slang bc i knew this person was younger than me because of it and when i said that they got uncomfortable and i felt disgusting.

i left social media mostly (tiktok, twitter, any place that shows too many images or videos) because of these intrusive thoughts and other ones.

i don’t want to look at children i don’t want to be around them. i keep analyzing every action i have with them just to try to assure myself. i don’t even want to really chat with other teenagers because what if i do something weird.

sorry i kept talking about the characters it is important i think i hope this aligns with the rules for venting here. there are other intrusive thoughts about them and myself but they are not about POCD.

I feel like everything is a conspiracy or something bad is going to happen to me or my family even though we are perfectly fine and no one is doing anything wrong. I feel like chicken little in the movie chicken little like the sky is falling everyday and there's no escape.  I'm scared of everything, the dark, getting robbed, catching a disease and the list goes on. I think I may have ocd. I'm trying to look for a good psychiatrist or psychologist.   All I want to do is sleep although I can't do that because I have bills to pay and a life to live. I've been so exhausted lately from the anxiety. It's so painful. Everyday is like hell. Pure hell and In a perfect world I would just wish for it to stop but I know that's not reality.My mind and soul is so so tired. I don't know how much longer I can live this way. Sleep is my best friend because I don't feel anything. I guess it's the closest thing to death ?and maybe thats why? I don't know how I ended up this way with being so scared of everything and so paranoid. I had a normal childhood and everyone treated me fine. I think my brain chemistry and hormones may be off, but also the last 5 years I have had the most stress I have ever experienced ever so I've constantly been in survival mode with no real breaks in between just one struggle to the next so I always feel like something bad is going to happen. I wonder if extremely high levels of stress can change you.im crying because I have a great life on the outside a great family and everything I need but for some reason my anxiety won't let me live.

Things as simple as mistaking past and present tense, something i would never make a mistake about before. I mostly had happy days, even if some days were bad. Nowadays i wake up feeling bad. Unable to do my school work. Ignoring every single message I get. Im clinging to a video game that empties my mind and makes me focus. But when I put it down the fog gets to me. I hold up so much coping mechanisms from chilhood trauma, so much guilt for a life wasted when my peers are successful, so much disgust for who I am that I dont even know how to define myself. I feel like a disgusting blob of flesh that shouldnt be alive. I shouldnt have failed my attempt a month ago but I did. Being driven to this point, you finally see an end to your problems and your thoughts. You dont think about failure. Jumping out a window isnt hard. But I have failed.

I'm struggling pretty bad at the moment, and I just can't understand why.  I've always had mental health issues (depression/anxiety/OCD), but I've never truly considered suicide.

I have a great life from the outside.  I have 2 wonderful kids, a loving wife, a good job, a home, a vehicle, and I lead a pretty decent life.  Inside, I'm in pieces.  I can't seem to be as happy as I should be, as I live in constant worry of something bad happening.  I chase highs, such as gambling, to try and take me out of that funk, which only leads me deeper.  Mind you, I'm not gambling into debt, it's small amounts to try and chase a rush.

I'm just not sure what to do.  I'm on both Lexapro (20mg) and they just put me on Welbutrin (150mg) due to me almost falling asleep every day on my way to work.  When I say falling asleep, I mean my eyes involuntary closing and me having to fight to keep them open.

185927856,It’ll be ok,1,1bozudv,1,"Hi. You don’t know me but you don’t have to.

I’ve been in the mental health space since I was like 11. I’ve got all kinds of fun mental health problems. I have had an array of diagnoses. I have 5. BPD/ADHD/BP2/ASD/PTSD. My life has been a mess. I know that it can feel like it’ll never get better. 

Don’t listen to those fucked up thoughts in your head you think 

You can do this. I have had adverse drug reactions throughout my life. I’ve tried every type of med. meds aren’t bad. Take them if you need them. The stigma surrounding medication is bullshit. 

I literally had an adverse reaction to ADHD meds about a week ago because as some of you may or may not know SSRIS and stimulants don’t mix well. I am extremely sensitive to meds and I had a full on mental breakdown. I hadn’t felt that awful for years.

I’ve been in remission for maybe 1-2 years now. And it took me 10 LONG FUCKING YEARS to get there but I’ll be damned if I’m not proud of myself for getting there.

And you can too.

Mental health issues are something so many people battle with. Some don’t get help. Ask for help. It’s ok. 

You are not crazy, weak, fucked up, broken, a loser, weird ETC. you’re a bad ass. You’ve got something that makes you an amazing human. Something that’s given you gifts in other areas you may not even know. 

You’re not alone. Man I got PISSED when people told me that. And I still do. Depression/anxiety/mental health problems create feelings of isolation where we THINK I’m alone and no one understands what I’m going through. It may seem like that. Sometimes you just have to wade through the storm and get through the rain to find the clouds then maybe some overcast but maybe there’s the sun

Suicide isn’t the answer. I was there. About 2 weeks ago. I was having severe suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self harm. I just had to not hurt myself. I had to keep my head up. Meds can do this to you. I stopped taking them and now I’m back to what I consider “normal”. You deserve to look at yourself 1/2/5/10 years from now and flip your mental health problems the FUCK OFF AND SEE HOW DAMN FAR YOUVE COME. 

You will be so proud of yourself for it. I know. I’m 24, I have 3 degrees including a masters. I have an amazing job that I earned. Friend wise and dating wise is a whole other story. But it’ll come.

I still have bad days even when I’m in remission. But I now am able to recognize those thoughts don’t have power over me. It’s weird and beautiful to see that. 


If you would have told me when I started this insane journey like 13 years ago I would be where I’m at I probably would have given you some major side eye and told you no that’ll never happen

But it did. I’m going to continue to kick ass. Maybe make some friends. Hopefully get a boyfriend. He can come find me. lol. 

Life sucks when it’s bad. But when you get on the other side you’ll be like fuck I did that.

Don’t give up. 

Shit gets better.

I don’t know how to start this so I’m just gonna get right into it. I’m a teenager that has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and my school psychologist has told me numerous times that i have symptoms of autism aswell. My family has a history of mental illness. I experience extreme anger in arguments and often cannot even recount some of the argument, just how I felt and some main parts of it. There was a point in my life that I call my ‘psycho era’, which roughly during the months of September-December 2022. I would get unnecessarily angry at almost everyone, and I know I was tearing everyone in my family apart. I would fight with my parents constantly, and my mother and father had been in fights/screaming matches late into the night (10-11pm) on multiple occasions during this time. They threatened to send me to boarding school many times, and once even said if I don’t stop ‘tearing the family apart’ I would be sent to a ‘girls home’. During this time in my life, I did often cut myself, and still sometimes I think ‘nobody will know if you do’. I understand it was my fault because of what I was doing, as I was very unhinged, and they were just trying to help me. They offered to get me a psychologist, I was hesitant at first, but eventually I was okay with that until they kept pushing it over and over again. I eventually started refusing their help and the fights continued. By early January 2023 the fights had slowed down a lot but we still get into arguments once or twice a week. Ever since late 2022 though, in most arguments or fights they bring up how I refused the help they were trying to give to me. I understand that they really were trying to help me but I can’t go back in time and fix that. About a month or so ago they brought up getting me a psychologist and I refused once again, the only reason for my refusal is what happened in late 2022 with them constantly pushing it on me. I’ve been extremely burnt out lately and I feel like there’s nothing to look forward to in my life. Every day feels the same and I feel myself getting more anxious and hopeless by the day. I don’t want to get bad again but I can feel myself slipping into these bad habits again that I tried so hard to get out of. Lately I’ve started cutting again, and I keep having suicidal thoughts and ‘I should just bleed out’ types of thoughts, and they’re getting worse. I don’t want to die. I’m scared that I’m going to do something bad to myself. I genuinely feel like everything that has happened to me is my fault and I know it was my fault what happened in late 2022.

bostiemama02,Husband has BPD,2,1bor12u,0,"My husband and I have been together for about 12.5 years, married for 7.5 years. We found out in 2018 that he had BPD after a very serious close call regarding suicidal ideations. From 2011-2021 we went through pure hell. I thought I was married to a narcissist and he did put his hands on me twice while drunk but that hasn’t happened since 2019. I’ve seen HUGE progress in him over the last 4-5 years, especially in the last 2-3 years. I actually have a lot of childhood trauma i deal with myself including growing up with an alcoholic mother (who was definitely either BPD, narcissistic, or something herself), parental alienation facilitated by her, many lies/manipulations by her, abuse, and then having to come to terms with the truth when I turned 18. Rekindled my relationship with my dad and the rest of his side of the family, unfortunately my dad died of a brain tumor in 2017 so I only got about 9 years of a true relationship with him. I am no contact with my mother, my stepmom is truly my mom and I’m so thankful for her, but I’m going through therapy for all that junk currently. I also have past painful experiences from an ex fiance, being sexually exploited, and feeling inadequate as well as scared to open up sexually. Not to mention the trauma and resentments I’m trying to move past with my husband. Don’t get me wrong, the progress we’ve both made is truly miraculous compared to what it was and we both really do deeply love each other. We want to work together and grow together. I absolutely have a lot of flaws (as do we all) and due to my own trauma as well as my resentment toward him for what he’s put me through, I don’t always respond as I should in conflicts or hard situations/discussions especially when it comes to navigating communication with a spouse who has BPD. He is a man who actually wants to communicate, talk openly about feelings, be vulnerable, etc. We have a 14 month old daughter and he’s a wonderful dad. He’s always pulled his weight in domestic labor, there aren’t gender roles or assignments in our house as he says. He literally can be the perfect man any woman could dream of, I don’t exaggerate. But then we have situations like tonight. For reference, last Thursday we had a seminar to attend and he’d asked a few weeks prior if it could just be us attending together and nobody else, since we know many friends/co workers in our field and I always sign us up as a group to get a discount for these classes.  So at that time I said yeah sure! As he asked, I signed only us up and we went together to the seminar. When we arrived, I didn’t realize one of my best friends was also attending and it’s someone he loves as well. We sat on opposite sides of the room after hugging hello but lunch time rolled around and he said “is it just us?” I said well what about her come with us too…? I could tell he was annoyed but I asked if he was mad, he said no it’s fine and brushed it off, so he continued to act normal and we went about our day. We had dinner afterwards before heading home and got into an argument, to me it felt like out of nowhere. He didn’t voice his irritation about her coming to lunch with us until the next day, said he felt like his needs weren’t heard, and that I lied to him. At that time, and even now, I didn’t say “well we spoke about it being just us going to the class together weeks ago, I stuck by what you asked and I only signed us up, I didn’t know she’d be there.” All I did was apologize with no justification and he said he appreciated my apology. To me, it doesn’t seem like a best friend of mine going to lunch with us was a huge deal especially when I said well let’s go get dinner together and then that obviously didn’t go well since he was already triggered by lunch. Ever since, he’s been short tempered and trying to work through the “hangover of feelings” as he calls it which has led to several situations of him just snapping at me, being rude, and crossing boundaries I’ve tried to set since I’ve read you should do that with BPD partners. I understand he got triggered when I didn’t stick to the whole day being just us, but I’ve already apologized genuinely for that and he’s told me time and time again “I can handle screw ups, I just need you to genuinely apologize and take accountability with no excuses”. Sometimes I feel like when he gets in these “BPD moods” he has a very grandiose sense of self from some things he says bc he frequently talks about how far he’s come in his journey of transformation and how I’m “behind him” and need to do a lot of work on myself , which I know this , but my frustration continues to lie in that if it weren’t for the hell I went through before his own transformation, me trying to be a pillar of strength for him when I was not even one for myself, standing by him, and forgiving him (or at the very least showing grace), maybe I WOULD be further along in my journey of self development. I try so hard to remember even with the improvements he’s made, he’s still BPD, but gosh sometimes the things he gets upset with me over just don’t seem as egregious as he makes them out to be in his mind. We both want nothing more for this to improve and I just need help in showing patience when he takes DAYS to get over something that I feel like isn’t a huge problem in the grand scheme of things. Didn’t mean for this to be so long but any advice would help. I don’t hate him or dislike him, I love him very much and I know he loves me too. What can I do to help improve my own understanding, patience, and communication in times like these with his BPD moods and how can I help him not shut himself off to me. ",1711506958.0,

We used to follow each other and sometimes I would reply to his stories. Until a few weeks ago I realized that I fucked up and become disgusted with myself. I blocked him from everywhere and deleted his number. 2 years ago when the real event happened I apologised him.He seemed down all day, I hated myself so much. I apologised him all day and the next day and then we were kind of normal again but Im sure he was acting that way towards me out of kindness. Now I dont think it was a sincere apology, or that he knew I was truly sorry. It was more like ""Im sorry Im sorry"" I probably made excuses. God, I hate myself. Now I dont know if I should message him and apologise, I dont want to open old wounds now, maybe he forgot about it and dont want to think about it. But If I dont write to him he wont know that I know what I did was bad and that Im sorry for it. Please someone help.",1711481102.0,
Ok-Interview-702,What causes bad anxiousness?,2,1bontvy,2,"Im a 20 yr old [F] & during my childhood & teen years I’ve dealt with a lot of trauma. I was in foster care at the age of 14 on up to 18. However, I grew up in a good environment during that time but was still sad that my own mother & father let me down. Because they were always in my life they just wasn’t in the right state of mind to take care of me. 
    *dad was a alcoholic wet head & my mom chose her boyfriend over me*

I had the best confidence during my teenage years too but ever since I turned 18, foster mom forced me out her home & I’ve been living in my apartment since then. I’ve lost a bunch of friends & family due to them making me a bystander. I’ve always wondered what made me different & i see life differently as well. 

Since last year [19] I’ve been having BAD anxiousness for no reason. I feel bad for no reason. I lost my confidence. I hate being in public.. etc. i haven’t been to a behavioral place but I wanna figure it out what it could be on my own. I’ve been drinking since 15 [F] to get rid of the pain but it’s like i wanna try something harder.

Don’t get me wrong im smart. I graduated. I have my own everything, home, car, & i work. But i am naturally not happy, the next thing i worry about is being mentally ill or trying a hard drug. ",1711498362.0,

I trend gradually downwards from around normal, until eventually I feel really bad - and then go to bed and the next morning I'm back at normal/feeling good\*. So basically - the flip from worst depression back to feeling good is overnight. 

Some ""worst"" is worse than others (used to have SI, but now normally not that bad), but it always involves a tonne of crying, and I never *gradually* improve after that, just eventually go to sleep and then all better the next day.

I've talked to some mental health professionals about this and they always seem super confused. So I'm just wanting to find someone who's had the same experience.

InitiativeSmall4703,I’m spiraling and I desperately need advice (DPDR),1,1boosfx,1,"Before I say any of this, I do want to say I have no formal diagnosis of anything. I have not been to any medical professionals about my mental health, despite wanting to. I plan on talking to my parents about this and hopefully seeking help in early May. I’ve posted this on multiple subs and haven’t been able to find the support I need, so I’m hoping this works. 

I developed what I’m 99.9% sure is DPDR after an experiencing a major hurricane when I was 13, nearly 7 years ago. It does not come in waves or episodes, it is constant and progressed significantly over the years. Within the last 2-ish has become increasingly hard to manage, but I was still able to properly live with it despite the issues. For the last few years (3-4 years after the initial onset), I would smoke weed occasionally. I would never do it very often, a few times per month if that, sometimes with large breaks in between. It would affect the depersonalization sometimes, but never enough to where I felt the need to stop. I typically would just go right back to my baseline level of dissociation. Last week, I had a medical joint which I had already hit multiple times in the days before. It was basically the last half of it and I decided to finish it off. I took like 9 hits (not abnormal for me) and it sent me spiraling. The entire world around me was spinning and didn’t stop for hours. I felt detachment that I genuinely did not think was possible. I went to sleep hoping I’d be better by morning but the detachment stayed. I feel very lethargic and dizzy constantly. It feels like the people I talk to and the world around me are completely fake, significantly more so than before. My vision is extremely blurry for any semi-long distance, and I can barely focus my eyes on anything. I’m becoming more and more depressed and constantly in a state of panic. These are all symptoms I had before, but now it has escalated to a point where I cannot function how I used to, which is extremely bad because this month is extremely important and busy when it comes to school. 

I’m a very anxious and somewhat paranoid person, so my brain is typically going overdrive on whatever is stressing me out. I think this is causing my DPDR to be as persistent as it is. This is not without a lack of trying to manage my anxiety, though. I regularly take anxiety relieving herbs like chamomile and lavender, try to practice deep breathing, manage and rationalize my thoughts whenever I can, take breaks when I need to, spend time in nature, etc. My parents are aware of my anxiety as well, though not to the real severity of it. Part of the problem is that the event that triggered my DPDR is unavoidable, I live in an extremely hurricane prone area. And my other obsessive anxious thoughts have been persistent since I was a child. 

I am really desperate at this point. I’m 19 and I’ve spent the entirety of my teenage years feeling completely outside of my body. I never mentioned it to adults around me because I had no idea how to even begin to explain it and was very afraid of what their reaction might be or how it might impact their view of me. And now, this has spiraled completely out of my control. Stress management has not worked and I need an alternative treatment. I will talk to them very soon, but this next month is extremely heavy with school and I need a temporary solution to be able to function in the meantime. If anyone could help me, I would appreciate it so much. 

Edit: Some distractions like playing a video game seem to help marginally, but I am still very dissociated during it and I cannot rely on that as a solution. It consumes everything I do, even when I’m not consciously thinking about it. I want to be able to spend time with my family and not be overwhelmed by dissociation, which is not possible with the way I currently am. I also intend on never touching weed again, I was never dependent on it to begin with and I cannot risk this getting any worse. ",1711500837.0,

suunnysideuup,Does this sound like mania?,2,1bof2zd,2,"

I used to take Prozac and I strongly believe that it triggered episodes of mania for me. Especially because since switching antidepressant, I haven’t experienced any of these things.

Here are some things I have done that make me suspicious (not all during the same period of time):

* had a strong belief in conspiracy theories and spirituality (specifically the “law of assumption” - the belief that you can control reality and you can think things into existence). Like, I genuinely believed that I could have anything I wanted if I thought it into existence (which I know sounds ridiculous)

* had intense urges to steal, and I often would. These would be small, cheap things I didn’t need at all, I just needed to steal them

* I once wrote a love letter for a guy in my class and gave it to him, which is INCREDIBLY uncharacteristic for me because I’m actually quite shy and normally wouldn’t have the balls to do that, and I didn’t even really like him? And when I think about it, that’s actually pretty creepy?

* tried to get into becoming a cybercriminal??? I once even tried to buy things using someone’s stolen credit card info???

* became insatiably hypersexual and met up with random guys (I used to think I did this to cope with being >!sexually assaulted!< to try and regain “control” but now I’m not sure?)

* I would also mutually drink alcohol in these periods (but never got drunk) when usually I’m much more able to turn it down

I briefly started it again last summer and I barely ate or slept for about a week. I also ended up in the ER and was genuinely convinced I was going to die (but I guess sleep deprivation can do that to you?) I also think the sleep deprivation and loss of appetite might have been because I was taken off of mirtazapine, an antidepressant that helps with those things, cold turkey. But I don’t know.

Typically, this state of misery doesn’t last over a month or two, and then I either become extremely apathetic and dangerous or extremely hyper and ‘happy’. I don’t know if I would call it happiness, but everything just feels more intensified. Everything seems beautiful, suddenly life is full of purpose and I am the best person alive. 

Recently, i’ve gone through another phase of planning my own suicide and intending on going through with it. The date is coming up, but i’m no longer miserable, simply extremely apathetic about everything. I don’t feel afraid of death, or of what I might do to myself. (Ive never understood how someone could be ‘afraid’ of hurting themselves).

I don’t really know what I will do to what I should do. Do I tell my therapist? If I do, she’ll send me to a hospital, and those are crazy expensive so i’ve heard. The only thing i’m scared of is causing my family financial burden, but I feel like i’m in a state of limbo right now. 

My family is working on getting me to a psychiatrist so I can be medicated for god knows what (my therapist thing is I may be bipolar), but I’m just worried about what I might do and how it will affect my family, not to mention that i’m terrified of how ashamed and embarrassed I will feel if I fail.

I'll give a little background about my situation. I am 23 years old. My mom passed away a week after I turned 21 after a 2 year battle with stage 4 colon cancer. She was only 56 when she passed. I live in a constant state of fear of getting sick (whether it be from cancer one day, or from every meal I make myself -- I am also an emetophobe). I am doing as well as I can while grieving my mother. I live with my dad. He was the sole earner in our family so my mom did everything for him as he worked (and still works) 12+ hour days in construction.

I have generalized anxiety disorder and irritable bowel syndrome, which irritate each other and when one flares up, so does the other. I have gone to therapy for the past 3 years and recently took a three-month break because I felt like I wasn't getting anything out of my sessions.

I just feel like I have so much potential but I don't know how to put it to use. I just finished a business degree with a 4.0 GPA. I have a pretty decent job given what the market is like right now and I'm decently happy with the work I do. I work in corporate retail and I love clothes so it's a good fit.

I just have a hard time with mundane tasks. Many days waking up in the morning, brushing my teeth, showering, they all feel like such a chore. I want to wake up early and enjoy my breakfast and make coffee and go for a walk but I constantly find myself waking up 10-20 minutes before my work day begins (I work from home).

I honestly don't know what kind of advice I'm really asking for. I just feel lost. I have an amazing boyfriend who I've been with for 6 years and who has been so supportive through my mom's passing and my difficult schooling. I know I don't have a bad life. I just feel so lonely and like I don't know how to take care of myself, even though I take care of my dad and our house and my pet bunnies.

I have a closet full of clothes I love (perks of working for a clothing company), but when it comes time to go to the office I opt for the most basic outfit just because I don't feel like wearing anything more than a sweater and plain dress pants. And I keep buying more clothes -- I shop when I'm sad, and lately it's all I've been doing in my free time (prepping for a trip to Italy so using it as an excuse, even though I am so aware I likely won't even get the chance to wear all the clothes I am buying). I can't bring myself to do my hair and makeup. I absolutely LOVE how I feel when I am all done up, even if it's just curling my hair and doing my makeup, and I thought when I finished my degree I would do it often, but it just feels so daunting. I blamed being a student on all of this laziness for years, yet now that I am not one and have free evenings and weekends, I don't take care of myself much more than I did when I was in the student grind.

I just want to know how I can motivate myself to get up in the morning, do my hair, put a little makeup on, so that I can feel good about myself. I'm just so tired of feeling like this despite knowing my life isn't all that bad and I should be enjoying it. I don't want to keep sad-shopping to fill the void.

It’s taking everything in me to not  tell him it’s completely ridiculous and most likely will not transpire- but I don’t want to upset him. He’s supposed to be recovering from his breakdown. 


How do you deal with this? I feel so bad for him because I know if he was healthy he would be able to pull this off somehow. I feel like I’m watching a train wreck and it’s just a matter of time before he probably ends up in psychosis again.

She has been diagnosed with schizotypal bipolar disorder and has been put on medication. But she flushes it down the toilet and refuses to get more help. 
I have seen her at nice times and not so great times either. Friday was just a disaster. 

My boyfriend and I were going to host Easter brunch, she asked us what time. My bf told her 11am and she said okay sounds good. Less than two hours later, she texts my boyfriend: “I know what I’m going to do for Easter. I’m going to kill myself.” This is not the first time she’s made threats of suicide.

My boyfriend was working so he called the PD in her town and asked to do a wellness check and told them what she said. She sent a screenshot of her text the the PD email address as proof. Two police officers show up and she refuses to let them in and is screaming at them from inside. She eventually lets them in and is just screaming and so angry. So between her behavior and her text as proof, they take her to the hospital. She is released TWO HOURS LATER. We were so shocked by this because we did our research and we thought it would be a minimum 72 hour hold. But no, she was released less than 3 hours later with mental health referrals that she is just going to throw away. 

She spent the weekend harassing my boyfriend with mean text messages all weekend. A few examples: 
-“You owe me $18k” (he doesn’t)
-“I never want to see you again”
-“PS. I hate you”

My boyfriend’s brother lives with her. He called my boyfriend crying a few weeks ago. In the background he heard his mother screaming at his brother calling him a pussy and that she gave birth to a daughter and not a son.

ParadigmShift007,Everyday habits that are making you hate yourself,2,1bn75vx,0,"we all have this negative voice in our heads whose only job is to remind us of our mistakes and the things we’re not good at.

But what if I told you that this voice is not you? 

This voice is basically the result of habits that you’ve picked up over time without even realizing it - habits that are making this inner critic louder and louder.

One of those subtle habits is **Carrying a False Persona**. Maybe you are someone who acts differently at work or online. Maybe you act funnier or more adventurous because someone once told you, ‘You’re funny’ or they would love to hang out with you. Or you might be having a tough time but don’t want to worry your friends and family, so you pretend that everything is fine. People seem to like this act, so you keep doing it, even if it’s not really you. But what most of us don’t realize is that if you’re constantly pretending to be someone you’re not, you start to dislike the false persona you present to the world and by extension, yourself for creating it.

Another habit that makes us hate ourselves is **not letting ourselves be happy**. Imagine you are someone who has always been told that you’re not good enough, like a child who constantly hears that they should be more like their sibling. You hear it so much that you start to believe it. And you think that no matter what you do, it’s never good enough. Now you think that wanting to be happy is selfish. So you listen to that little voice in your head that tells you not to get your hopes up. It reminds you of all the times things went wrong when you let yourself feel happy. But you might not realize that when feelings of regret and self-blame grow to be unbearable, it can lead to self-hatred and keeps you from re-engaging with life.

Similar to this there are more habits like **failing to accept compliments**, **being insecure all the time**, **keeping gratification over responsibilities** and more. So before these habits take a toll on our self-esteem, it is important to address them.

I recently came across some interesting research studies and articles on this topic and decided to create an [animated video](https://youtu.be/P8mIitxNWx0?si=ym6WHIWoSy10saOJ) to illustrate the topic. 

If you prefer reading, I have included important reference links below.

I hope you find this informative. I’d love to hear your thoughts on it!

I’ve been to some therapy myself, and I work in the medical field, but am far from an expert on psychology/mental health, and had never heard the term prior to this conversation. I am seeking to better understand this disorder (?) and want to be supportive and helpful to him in any way I can. 

I have noticed that he seems more detached than usual, and potentially is dissociating more frequently. He doesn’t seem to be in any danger of losing touch with reality, but has described feeling that he is not sure what’s real and what is a dream at times. 

I am just not sure how to support him through this part of his healing. I want him to know that I am here and thinking about him, but also don’t want to smother him or keep bringing the issue up needlessly. I guess I am just at a loss for what to say at times, especially when we are together and he feels distant. 

**Has anyone here experienced derealization that could offer some advice? Or perhaps helped a friend/partner through this? Your input is appreciated.**


**P. S.** Adding this bc I see so many advice requests where the OP has not discussed the topic with their partner/person involved… FWIW, we have good communication and I believe he knows it is safe to discuss anything he’d like without fear of judgement or other negative repercussions. I have asked him directly if there is anything I can do (or do less of) to help, and made sure he knows I’m available and receptive if he does think of something that would be helpful to him, or just feels like sharing. (Thus far, he is unsure but says he will tell me if he notices anything.) However, I am concerned that continuing to bring the issue up could exacerbate the problem. I also don’t want to be one of those people who approaches an already-overwhelmed person with demands. (ie- “Oh you’re having x problem? Tell me what I should do to help you.” Thus adding even more to his plate) Hence why I came to Reddit looking for advice from those with more experience.

ka1lynn,is this normal? no one else i talk to seems to think so (read post please),1,1bmt8re,2,"hello ^_^ sooo i was talking to my mom this morning and (i dont remember how it was brought up) i told her that when im in a great deal of physical pain, i will create another source of pain for myself to ease it. i know that sounds weird but like, here is an example. 

when i stretch in the mornings, i will sometimes get random foot cramps that put me in absolutely debilitating pain. to ease the pain in my foot, i will bite down super hard onto my lip to distract from the other sense of pain. 

my logic for this is, random bodily pain that comes out of nowhere hurts super bad. when im in states of extreme pain or discomfort, my brain will hyperfocus on it, making the pain feel worse. so i will self inflict pain to lessen the pain i feel elsewhere. when its self inflicted, the pain doesnt hurt as bad when uou know what to expect. my brain will instead hyperfocus on the pain im causing to myself instead of the random flare up im experiencing. 

i told my mom this and she told me i needed cognitive behavioural therapy but i was like ""ehhh my mom is always kinda over dramatic"" so i asked many of my friends who also experience mental illness and they agreed with my mom. so im confused, how weird is this behaviour??

im autistic if that helps.",1711308859.0,
Emergency-Bus-998,Abused and confused ...  my life,2,1bmkeil,0,"Spending way too much time in my head


I wrote a thinner version of this last year, and am now writing more into it 2024... 
 Some things are out of order and some things may be a bit vague, but the end result is the same.  

I was born in a small coal mining town in east coast Canada to very unsophisticated and uneducated people.   Brought up in a abusive home where everyone got abused and confused.   If my father wasn't beating me, my mother was.  Sometimes at the same time ... belts, sticks, shoes,  bathroom towel bar.  If I to hide under the bed, they'd both lift the bed from either side and catch me in the middle with no way out.  My father,  who never called dad... we all referred to him by his first name.  So I'm confused confused as a kid, and he always remained not interested in his kids.  I am not l sure of that was because he wasn't interested in my mother.  But no love was ever shown.  The only emotion I can see coming from this man was the expressions he show when winding up to punch my mother ... or the madness in his eyes when he put my head, as 10 year old, on a wooden kitchen chair and was going to whack me over the head with a pipe...  my mother stopped that attack... again,  abused and confused.  

when I was 10 years old, I was molested by an uncle at my aunt's place...abused and confused.

That is the time I started to play with other little boys in the neighborhood... thinking this is what little boys do ... not until I was 13 or 14 did I know boys and girls were suppose to be together.

But as a 10 year old, I can remember laying on our couch with my hands down my pants playing with myself ... a true result of molestation... my father was walking by and saw me ... well fuck, the doubled up and said 'get your hands out of your pants you nasty little fucker '  and proceeded to punch me in the head with his doubled up fist. ...shamed ... abused and confused

At that point and I was,  on one hand ashamed of myself.  As a pre adolescent, going into my teens, I was confused as to whether I like boys or girls.  But I have been playing with boys since that's I knew about.  

Now all this happened,  and for the next 4 years, nothing changed except my mother was a very mentally unstable person and spent a lot of time either trying to kill herself ... abused and confused ... and terrified.   

Or she spent a lot of time in the Butterscotch Palace ... the nickname for the mental institution in our area when they were in existence... she'd go for while, and come back home.... to continue getting beat by my father.... and abusing us.

The abuse doesn't end at home:  

Asked on another reddit post;  who is your worst teacher and why?:

My response:

My worst teacher... ha ha ha ... Jesus, I wish I could confronted him 20 years ago when I was still a revengeful person.... 

In grade 5 ... so I would have been 10 years old ... 

In my math class, I got cheating on a test... OK... my bad ..

This teacher put me in the corner with a dunce cap on ... OK, that's fair punishment... I didn't have to like it tho... So I took it off and went back to my desk after 15 minutes ... 

He said: I didn't tell you to go back to your desk and grab me and put me back in the corner with the dunce cap ... after another 15 minutes, I took the dunce cap off and tore it into two and went back to my desk

Again, he came back to put me in the corner... this time I resisted... 

What came next was nothing short of criminal.

He picked me up off the floor and slammed me on the floor ... got on top of me and was punchinĝ me in the face and head... that lasted for what seemed for ever... after I was able to get up, I picked up a desk and threw it at him.....

While he was trying to stop the desk, I ran out the door and went home to tell my mother.

What came next l, was nothing less than heroic... as seen by a 10 year old...

Now, I don't give a shit what anyone has to say of how bad I was by cheating on a test .... there is no excuse whatsoever for a grown man to be beating on a child the way this mother fucker beat me that day... but it was a day he regretted once my mother stepped in ... 

It was a very traumatic experience... not only me.
Fast forward, 35 years later, I received a FB message from a class mate at the time expressing her inability and apologies for not being able to do something to help me and that she often thinks about that beat down... abused and confused...


Now 11 years old my parents decided enough was enough and split up.  The three youngest of the family went with her... and for a while, it was OK.  I know it should not be a converned for an 11 year old boy, but that's what the molestation did to me, and I continued to seek out other little boys... it's become so engrained in my brain.  

However,  in a while after that, my mother could not handle being a single parent and went back to the mental institution for the longest time.  And that is where we had to go visit her of we wanted to see her... and after all the abuse and torture,  why would we?... as an 11...12...13...etc, it was the only 'love- we knew ... but the traumatic affects of witnessing your mother locked up with a bunch of other mentally ill people doing some very strange things was another form of physiological torture... abused and confused...

My mother was in no condition to take care of children, or she would otherwise kills us... so we were shipped off to orphanages.   Another place to be abused... and find other little boys to play with in the middle of the night... shame and uncertain...

As I was growing up, I started to get attracted to females... I didn't know that was a thing until teens years... but in the end, I was so use to playing around with boys, that's where I stayed... confused...

I grew up always being attracted to females, and had a few girlfriends in my teen years, one of which I was head over heels in love with... but had no confidence,  self-esteem or respect for myself... so i continued to play with boys. 


My whole childhood, teen years and adulthood has been one of jealously of:

1.  Other men and sons that have, not only a weaker than should be relationship,  at least there is a relationship,  or very strong bonds.... something I'd never know

2.  Family get together of any kind ...  never experienced loving family get together...  there are 6 surviving members of our siblings... when we got together, that is all there was, were loud violent arguments about who had the worst beat down from my my mother and or father... abused and confused 

My innocence was stolen from me sexually, emotionally and physiologically.  Even up to today... and yes, I have slept with men (not boys) all my life... more than I care to count... but I have always been attracted to women, I will never know what it would be like to be a father... I'm not even sure to this day of my mentality is that of a gay man.  I've always been uncomfortable, and somewhat ashamed of living a gay life style.
 
FAMILY BREAK UP

My mother and father broke when I was a very early age.  My one sister that was 1 year and two months older, and my younger sister who was 4 years younger went to live with my mother.  But as I stated somewhere else, she was in and out of mental institutions and a nursing home homes for the most part of her life.

There were one or two people that tried to take care of us in my mother's absence in the beginning.  I am not  quite sure why things did not work out for my sisters.  However, I don't t hink a lot of people were equipped or knowledgeable enough to take care of severely physocologically abused children going through what we, I went through. 

I was labelled as a trouble kid... what the fuck... of course I was going to be troubled.  I was being thrown away for now reason.  This is all after being sexually abused, physically abused and emotionally abused.  The peoople who tried to take care me didn't understand this ... my social workers gave me no support or direction.  My own famaily gave me no support.  I can remember following my oldest sister around like a lost puppy.  She had the support of my older cousins around her age and a bit older that help guide her when she left the nest.  Her and my older brother.   The rest of us, I feel were just left to the system without a care in the world.  Of course I had emotional problems as a kid... nobody dealt with it except label me as a bad kid...  and some times, we become what we are labled... This is a quote I use to use:
Show a man what he is and he only becomes worse,
show a man what he could be,
only then, he becomes what he should be

To be honest, I cannot remember where I lived between 13 and 15.  But I do remember spending time around Glace Bay and getting into trouble.  This is the first time I ever went to reform school because I broke, with two other guys, who broke in to the bowling alley on the main drag.  I can remember, as bad as it was being locked up... because there was physical abuse at this place as well... I didn't want to leave.  People actually paid attention to me there.  The good people.  John B was a complete asshole.


My heart has cried for the past 55 years being empty and going through life without a purpose.. .

As I turn 56 next week, although I do not plan on doing any unspeakable atrocities,  as my sister who committed suicide in 2018, I'm wondering what's life really worth?

Things were so bad that I have never been able trust anyone, develop any close relationships or have the ability to love or be loved.  Today, I remain single and alone.  Which is fine with me.  Everyone in life has seemed to leave me.  Yes, I have not developed strong social skills or relationships... in almost all of life.  How could I?  We all didn't have the same chances. Or because the trauma was so bad, I couldn't.   Anyone who thinks they know me, knows fuck all about me.

SCHOOL:

I had a hard time in high school.  Low self-esteem,  confidence made worse by ignorant racist teachers. Hard as it was,  I was placed in the ""slow learners class"" since I was a couple years behind.   At one point I started to gain a little confidence when we wee given an assignment. But we were told not to go a head of the rest of the class. 

Feeling like a smart kid who accomplished something good, I did.
 
What came next from the teacher was shameless.  He called me stupid and shouted me down in front of the whole class making me feel extremely stupid....

And so that is what I believed I was starting then, and for the very longest time didn't pursue further education... until in the job training... but even still, always felt inadequate because I didn't finish high school.

I quit high school shortly after that episode.  And at the same time ended up being thrown out of the children's aid society to be on my own ...

No love, no guidance,  no role models.  Where was a young man who was sexually, emotionally and physiologically abused to turn?... 

I spent most of my life, even today, hiding my sexuality, being ashamed and somewhat dirty about it.  I do feel sad that being a father was taken away from me.  But in the long run, it is for the best ... maybe I'm wrong and could have made a wonderful father.  But the way I feel makes me think I wouldn't have been.  I have only been able to survive for myself throughout the years.

Yesteryear,  I use to worry a lot about what people think of me, contrary to what I just mentioned about still hiding my sexuality, I don't particularly give a flying shit what people think.  Nobody was there for me in the past growing up, they don't have a right to judge me

I must end things here .... although the story doesn't end

But one last note: to all of the abuser and those that are mentally unstable please please think about what you doing ... you destroying lives of innocent kids and or creating future monsters

Adventurous-Gain-207,Where did my whole day disappear?,1,1bmoucz,3,"I have been feeling oddly foggy the whole day. Same with yesterday. I have forgotten almost everything I’ve done today and my day seems to have just disappeared. It’s as if I just skipped a whole day. Same with yesterday. 
Yesterday I went to the movies and that is all I remember from yesterday. From today i don’t remember anything but the fact I made food. 
I feel sluggish and heavy. I also have sort of dizziness while seated. I’m not really dizzy but my body feels like it’s constantly swaying. 

 It’s as if my whole body is heavy to move and everything seems hard to do. I can’t focus on one thing for long amounts of time. 

I have bipolar and I have these sort of dissociation moments when in a manic episode but this doesn’t really feel like manic/hypomanic episode. 
I have forgotten to take my medication yesterday but it shouldn’t have this big of an effect on me. 

Does anyone have any experience with anything similar or know what this could be. Is it just me having one of my dissociation/ depersonalisation / derealisation moments and a sign of a manic episode arriving.

1) She feel terrified when someone casually enters her room even me. She casually do
Some household things and lost in thoughts and if I suddenly enters room casually she suddenly frightened. She is saying I should make some noises before entering her room. That partially works, but most of the time she frighten for that sounds as well.

2) She is gynic patient, she is taking treatment for kids and that medicine seems taking time to work so she thinking alot of about kids and she cried as well.

3) yesterday due to some other throat issue we visited hospital , doctor suggested endo. Doctor gave her some anesthesia, after endo is completed she cried alot and continuesly say “I could not take this “ initially I thought due to kids and throat issue then I suddenly realised she lost her memory and went back to 4 yrs . She doesn’t even recognise me and She dont know i am her husband.

The words she is saying “I couldn’t take this”  is about 4 years back. She is anemia patient lost so many blood due to her pcos issue, so she suddenly fainted in office and her friends took her to hospital. So she was thinking she hospitalised due to that  and she took almost 30 minutes time to realize present.

Pretty-Highlight1542,Husband changed since psychosis and mania episode.,6,1bm8r5n,20,"My husband and I have been together for almost 35 years. In that time, I’ve seen his mental health decline significantly. About ten years into the relationship he became addicted to alcohol. It nearly destroyed him, us and our daughter. He was a “functioning “ alcoholic- in that he was able to work and be the sole provider for the family. But in terms of our relationship, and his role as a father, it was very hard. He was good and then he’d be awful- specifically towards me when he was in a bad mood and frame of mind. I almost ended the marriage 5 years ago when he started a work relationship that was crossing all kinds of boundaries. His ups and downs were dramatic. But I never thought he was mentally ill. Last year he finally quit the daily chronic alcohol addiction, and started hardcore therapy which included regular appointments with a psychiatrist as well as a prescription for antidepressants. I never thought in a million years that he was depressed. But obviously the daily abuse of alcohol should’ve been a dead giveaway. During the last year he was doing so much better- without the alcohol and now the antidepressants he was a new and calm person. Maybe a little too calm, as what I was used to was someone that was very charming, animated and funny. But I felt I just need to give him a chance to get back to his old self- the one that I loved and married. Fast forward to last month, and he started to use psychedelic mushrooms. He started to use them daily, ending with one day taking an insane amount. He ended up getting a psychotic episode with mania that lasted 2 weeks. Lots of crazy stuff happening. Calling police on me for no reason. Calling police on family members accusing them of murder from a decade ago. I discovered he was sneaking out to meet up with an escort, but he got scammed out of $500 and ended up in a complete psychotic attack. It was terrifying. He went for a regular scheduled appointment with his psychiatrist and I gave them a heads up as to what had transpired in the two weeks prior. They ended up keeping him in the psychiatric hospital without his consent for 72 hours- which ended up being extended to over 2 weeks. 

Needless to say my entire universe has been uprooted. The pain of the betrayal of him contacting an escort was and still is unbearable. I have cried for weeks and now, to add insult to injury, he’s home and a completely different person. They said his episode was brought on by a combination of the psychedelic drugs as well as his antidepressants. Now he’s on antipsychotics for an indefinite period. He is not the man I knew. I’m so confused and so sad and completely lost and depressed and hurt. I cannot see myself being happy with this person he is right now- he is a little bit…I’m not sure how to describe it- maybe emotionless? 

So here we are- he’s a shadow of his old self. I’m completely devastated. And of course- none of the issues of what he did during that episode have been resolved or even addressed properly. 

I don’t know what to expect. Has anyone else been through something similar? Is this who he is now? How did you navigate the relationship?

Recently however because of my mother pressuring I’ve gone down to a half dose without consulting my psychiatrist. I’m two years into college and I haven’t made any friends, I just talk to my old high school friends. I feel like I lack the ability to care about people, I don’t know if it is new or if it’s always been this way. I feel like I only use my friends to not be lonely rather than liking them. I feel like when someone cares about me I toy with their emotions to make myself feel powerful. I feel like all I care about is my image. I feel like I know what a healthy happy relationships should be and I idealize it in my head and I mimic that in my relationships but I don’t actually feel it. I have never been romantically interested in anyone besides a literal voice in my head. I can’t picture any future and making and maintaining new relationships feels like a chore. I don’t like to talk about my feelings. I don’t like to be touched. I feel like I daydream so much about the perfect world that the real one seems unimportant. But then there is solid contradictory evidence. I do any favor anyone asks of me. I pour myself into making personalized gifts and planning elaborate parties for people unprompted. I objectively enjoy doing things for others. Maybe it’s because I get to have the image of a good person. From a very young age I used to cry because I felt like I wasn’t doing anything to help people. Whenever I hurt someone the guilt consumes me so completely that the relationship is never the same. I punish myself so much for hurting them that I end up punishing them for being hurt and I hate myself for it. I used to cut and now I burn but I have never known why. Every little mistake I make no matter how inconsequential rocks me to my very core. I think it’s because I like to think I’m perfect and when that is cracked I can’t handle it.

But after one of these games my jr./sr. year, I went to my first therapy session. And basically as I recall all that was really talked about was how my main friends were doing drugs/drinking and I didn’t know how to fit in. I can’t remember if my family mental health history was brought up or talked about. However, I never went again.

I quit smoking weed my senior spring semester in fear of drug test by the school for sports.But by the summer after graduation, I took off for the most part.

My freshman year in college within 4-6 weeks of getting there, the anxiety was really there and I guess my parents advised me going to the health center at the university. Pledging a frat/and was partying everyday in some form btw. From my recollection, not sure if I took any tests(i think I did), it felt now in retrospect the quickest psychiatrist appointment I have ever had. He diagnosed me with anxiety/ adhd ( the adhd symptoms where definitely there before I just didn’t notice them or understand them). Prescribes zoloft and either concerta or vyvanse. And I can’t remember if I even went back much after that that year. 

Now, from then until I flunked out after that spring semester, I partied extremely hard with virtually everything minus meth/heroin. My parents gave me a pass after that first semester knowing my “mental condition” affected my grades.

From summer 2010 till nye 2011, I went to community college, lived at home, worked, and partied.
In fall of 2011 I moved back to my college town just to “work”. And I felt somewhere in Nov, I was going up or something was different. And on Jan 1, 2012 after raging nye, I woke up and I was up. And it was mania which lasted 3ish days. That’s its own story. My parents at this point believed it was bipolar. My dad’s mom had it, as well as substance abuse. And there’s tons of anxiety/depression/substance abuse on my moms side.


Go to psychiatrist a few weeks later, get diagnosed with bipolar I. And it was the first time Put on I believe just a low dose of lithium. I was told I can’t drink or do drugs anymore. Not just because of being bipolar but because of the med. I had moments of clarity prior to this,but never really wanted to quit. I cut back on using/drinking, but within a month of that manic episode. And the I went down and was really down, in the bed alot. Dabbled on and off with weed/booze but was just down,


That summer worked and was sober the whole three months, (there’s a religion/christianity aspect from childhood till even rn but thats way too much to describe) but was very into reading the bible even the year before/ in a spiritual world, and that lasted throughout to aug.

In aug 2012 I go to another psychiatrist and was put on stayed on lithium and then lamcictal, and adderall or vyvanse.

I decided to major in religious studies just to “learn”/ get a degree back at the same university. And very early I decided to drink/use again. But for the most part aug 2012-aug 2014, I graduated while partying and didn’t really think anything was wrong or going on. There were no symptoms that was causing me to miss class or stay in bed. Or mania/hypomania(at least i dont know if there were).

From graduating aug 14- aug 20 i basically worked odd jobs, played in bands, partied all through out increasing more and more as time wenr on(minus maybe a combined 7 months of complete sobriety) went to the same psychiatrist and would just say in fine give me the refills repeat 3 months. I’d say in 2015 I went down bad for at lesser two months. I remember getting on abilify. From 2016-2020 I basically just went down more and more, year to year. There were alot of downs, anxiety, but obviously I was an addict/alcoholic in denial. Aside from 2016-2017, I’ve lived with my parents. 

Aug 2020, started AA and told the psychiatrist this. I don’t even remember what was said. Relapsed that nov. June 21 till today ive been clean/sober.

Here’s where it gets fun. Ive been trying my ass off since that day not just with sobriety(100s of meetings, step work, and just doing the thing, which after a year and a half I realized this isnt working for my brain problem, it helped definitely getting sober), but probably been on 15 new meds in different combinations, went to two different psychiatrists then back to the original one. The symptoms of depression, anxiety, racing thoughts have pretty much have never stopped . I got off adderall shortly after I got clean until this past aug, so that created  its own deal. Ive been to multiple therapists, iops, but never really sticking around because of my “physiological” state was that just gonna let me be there and do the deal. Also throughout this process I gained probably 40-50 lbs and lost most of it last year getting off seroquil/depakote.

Finally in Nov of last year, the original psychiatrist said pills aren’t working. AND my mother asked “is he even bipolar” and he said “thats the 64k dollar question” and suggested TMS. Mind you I’ve never had another manic episode in my opinion. If I have, not even close to the original one from 2012. He suggested TMS and went the tms route in jan of this year. 


After eleven treatments, there was no relief and I didn’t have enough in me to finish( not the treatment just living how its been for so long). That dr said ketamine infusions . Just did 6 infusions and there’s results but then theres not.

TO CONCLUDE, really since the beginning of this year all ive been doing is working on this. Changed diet to a degree,supplements, kombucha/kiefer, tons of fruit , i was diet soda guy, ive had less than ten this year, i cant run or lift weights due to some injuries, but i walk an average of 4-5 miles rain,shine,snow.  Breathing excerises more, meditate when I can, only drinking glass bottled water, and just talking to so many people who have or  are around something to do with mental illness. Started back therapy, got me on cbt, and ill go over with the psychologist the tests i took again to “see what he thinks I have”


THE MAIN POINT: I’ve described over and over, “ my brain hurts when I think(whether racing thoughts/anxiety) and after however long I get down/depressed and that repeats just about every day if not all day long”

And every time whether the main psychiatrist or  therapist whoever can’t address that as is. They go off on some story or analogy and they just cant say “yeah I understand and this is what I can do”. Its taken this long to realize you have to be direct and stay on my point. But even then I still don’t know if what im trying to convey is being understood to said person.


Im fighting folks, im tired, and im not giving up.  I know there’s no cure all or specific answer for all us. But idk who to talk to cause it seems everyone has their own opinion and they are different. Ill give the cbt a try but its gonna do me in regardless if its what i need rn or not. There’s way more to this story but if you read it, then thanks for doing that.

Wide-Classroom-587,My dad might be a pedophile and I’m starting to feel uncomfortable around him. What should I do?,147,1bl9moc,25,"Hi I’m a Female. 17 this year. My dad has been showing abnormal behaviors when it comes to minors. My dad, M 44 . Married with 3 kids, I’m the middle child. He likes to make pedo- jokes. For instance, when he drops me off to school, he jokes about finding him a girlfriend from my school. When he spots any young women in the streets, he’ll make jokes about picking them up and give them rides. I obviously only thought it was annoying at first, until this one time were he made this same joke but with a clearly pre- teen looking girl. She seemed around 12 , clearly only starting puberty. That’s when I absolutely lost it. This is one of the very few things, I would also like to mention he’s very obsessed with the idea of looking young.. In other people’s eyes. He gets happy when someone compliments him for looking younger. Which he kind of does. However, he’s now using me to create this look. If I’m making any sense, he likes to bring me out everywhere he goes. Even places were I don’t necessarily need to be at. I’m starting to think he brings me with him so people assume I’m his girlfriend or wife, since I’m young which did happen one time. He hugs me so often in public. Even in front of my mom, he never acts lovely with her but he does with me. I feel like crying as I type this.. I’m so disgusted at him. When I tell him I don’t wanna accompany him, he gets mad and starts complaining saying i only stay home playing video games which is true but why so disappointed? For sure t’s not just simple quality time between father and daughter, after all his past jokes. But for certain, I don’t believe he sexualizes me either. I’m his daughter and he does provide for us, he does his job as a father of 3. But he’s not a good husband and I do think my mom deserves better. I’m not an expert so I obviously can’t just assume he might be one but this is all I can think of. What do you think?

They were in an arranged marriage at 14 and 15, had me at 19 & 20. My grandfather was the pastor at one point, but when he passed my dad kinda lost it and went mia when I was 5.

At 29 my mom came out as gay, we lived with my grandparents so she was told to leave, shunned by the church and only community we've known. It was me & mom then against the world. I was either right by her side as she experienced a new world, or at home alone. By age 11 I was mostly home alone while my mom worked 2 jobs from 6am-10pm m-f. She did her very best for us. So I always wanted to be a ""good kid"" don't ask for anything, don't complain, always took care of mom when she got home, listen to her problems and worries. I learned how to be responsible very young, but I was so isolated from the world.

We were poor so we didn't have cable, or Internet, never went on weekend trips or vacations, so I'd just go to school and come home. I ended up becoming afraid of going into stores or around other people outside of family.

I stopped talking by 10th grade, physical speaking feels uncomfortable. And I can never find the correct pitch or volume for my voice. And when words do come out they're either incoherent or confusing to others 🤦🏽‍♀️ damn.... I can write just fine, but any kind of human/social contact and my brain evaporates. 

I   met my now husband at age 20, so that's when I started experiencing the world, learning new things, but the things I had to unlearn was rough.... I'd hide in closets, under desk, just anywhere out of sight, had lots of panic attacks, self harm by scratching myself with my nails when I was nervous. I finally learned what anxiety and depression was and started going to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist. I couldn't have improved so much without the help of my husband and his family who are HUGE mental health advocates.

Now I'm 25, I've imported SO much, but in social situations I can't really relate to others on a personal level as I haven't had the same life experiences growing up, and I'm still naive in some things so there's lots I don't know or fully understand....

Rosesnlillies,Husbands infidelity and mental health,1,1blp5jc,2,"Hello everyone,

I am still in disbelief how my life fell apart so fast. I (36F) have been married to my husband (38M) for six years and been together for 12 years. He was a very loving, caring husband who always told me how lucky he was to have me and I thought we had a happy marriage. This past January he started to develop mental health issues . He started seeing things and hearing voices. Later on he had periods of time in which he felt amazing and periods of deep depression (thats why I think its probably bipolar with psychosis but no official diagnosis since he always refused help).I pleaded with him to go to the doctor but he refused. This escalated to the point that he started seeing me as his enemy. One day he divorced me ( we are muslims so if a husband verbally divorces his wife , they are divorced unless they reconcile). He told me i wasn't allowed to leave the house and that I had 3 months to find my own place ( we both own the house). I freaked out and went to my mothers place. The next night he came by and threw in a window, and threw iron rods and wooden planks over the wall and called me a whore. Even after all of this I tried to get him treatment and to reconcile since I knew this was unlike him an that he is ill. We started meeting up again, and he said he divorced me because voices in his head were telling him I am a bad woman. He sort of agreed of going to the doctor but no medication. He had shared his location with me and I noticed he frequented what seemed to be a brothel.I went to check, and sure enough it turned out to be a brothel. I confronted him about this and he said he is a prophet and these women were made permissable to him by God. He also said I thought you had entered the prostitutes body in the form of an angel and i thought it was you. He also said I shared my location with you willingly and you saw where I was so you are ok with it. He had lied previously about being faithful and about his whereabouts.Never once did he apologize or said he will not do it again. I was in complete shock, and urged him to seek medical help but he still refused. Thats when I felt I had had enough. His dad tried to call the next day to mediate but I was furious and sent a message saying I want a divorce because he was visiting prostitutes. He only called me once anonymously, so im not sure it was him. He continued to visit prostitutes , even went to the red light district in my city. Then 4 days ago he suddenly stopped and has been getting letters from the police so i guess he did something that scared him enough to stop for now. He has cut me off financially and has gotten a second phone. I was furious at his infidelity and still am but I still care about him and somewhere there is this guilt of should I have approached things differently since I know he is ill. But how much can you take , even if someone is mentally ill? Shouldn't I hold him accountable for the fact that to this day he keeps denying medical help and would rather divorce and visit prostitutes than get help? For the past 12 years there hasn't been a day that has gone by without him and I am feeling broken without him but I feel I have no other choice than to divorce him. Its either that or accept him visiting prostitutes. His coldness about everything and not lifting a finger to sort things out hurts and I am scared about the future.",1711190098.0,
Full_Watch_1788,i’m a toxic and horrible partner,2,1blk3i8,6,"yesterday night, i went on a huge rant to my boyfriend about something that has been in my mind for the longest, longest time - his instagram following being filled with prettier, older, and much more conventionally attractive girls. my insecurity was already bad, but it worsened. so badly. to the point that i would obsessively check every single one of their accounts to make myself seem more like them, such as buying clothes similar to theirs, posting instagram stories similar to theirs, and overall trying to be more like them. some of these people are people that he liked, but claims not to anymore (which i fully believe, since i still follow one or two people that i liked in the past, having no feelings for them, but recently unfollowed.) so, in an argument last night, i brought this up aggressively (more in pain than anything) (i was even telling him he was in love with everyone else except for me which i know isn’t true but i still did?) and my boyfriend unfollowed every single one of these girls - even the ones that are his friends. i feel immensely immensely toxic now, and i'm beginning to unfollow all of the males that i know, even though most are just people that i follow from years ago and don't even know exist. what can i do to change this? i'm becoming so toxic and disgusting and i can't stand myself anymore. help me, please. i let my emotions get the very best of me.

I remember back when I was little, I hit my head on a floor while me and my family were outside, I remember that they put an ice pack on my head, and then when I asked mom about it, she said that they brought me to a nearby doctor, but the problem is that she no longer knows what the doctor said since it was a very long time, I guess it's 16 years from here? So going back to emotions, imagine that you're browsing the internet and you come across a gruesome scene like an accident where there's gore. Will you be shocked about it? Well, about me, when I saw these kinds of things, the only thought going through my head was ""Damn"". I guess I'm desensitized to gore? Another instance is that when there's a discussion about something, I instantly think that the most upvotes/liked comment is correct about their opinions, like I take sides without considering them, and then when a more logical one comes, I instantly switch sides. Maybe I'm just retarded? Or is it the brain damage? Or worse, I'm a psycho? (I hope not).

Wonderful-22,Intrusive thoughts and perfectionism,1,1blhyd9,0,"Hi, I need help. I’ve been struggling with with perfectionism for years to the point that I can’t enjoy things anymore. Every time, I always wait for the time I deserve something. I have LISTS of all the things I want to do, that I can only do once I’m perfect. I disciplined myself to do this, or more like I allowed judgment to control my life entirely. I haven’t watched a single episode on Netflix in years no matter how much I want to. I haven’t read a book in so many years no matter how much I want to. I have so many things I want to do but I’m crippled by the fact that I’m imperfect. Because of this, I never tell others I have hobbies. Because they should only be seeing me working on myself because I am not perfect. And if they see me happy, this should be kept to a limited time not longer than needed. 

I am pretty sure it’s the fear of judgment that’s holding me back. I got this years ago when I became self-aware. That people judge and there’s a hierarchy. I don’t want to disrupt that hierarchy because it would lead to more judgment. I don’t want a single person to think “this person doesn’t deserve to be doing these things” because I haven’t proved myself yet. I’m not yet successful, I don’t have good grades, I don’t have accomplishments. I don’t deserve to be happy.

I don’t deserve to do things when I’m not perfect. I think being in a uni of high-achievers influenced this. Everyone around me are so well-spoken, have plenty of friends, have nearly perfect grades, and have achievements. I am far from those. And these are the only people who deserve to be happy because they’re perfect, I’m not. The only times I do things imperfectly is when it’s urgent. The ones where I have no choice but to do it. But when it comes to things I have the ability to do optionally, I can’t. I just can’t. I feel so uncomfortable because I don’t deserve it. 

I envy those who aren’t perfect but are happy and not crippled by thoughts I have. The fact that these people exist makes me want to overcome this problem so bad. I just want to earn the right to be free. I have to prove myself worthy that I am allowed to do things for myself like watch movies and read books. That’s why when people in real life hear from me, I am only open about productive things. Because people are not going to judge when it’s only right for me to be productive because I am deeply flawed. If I’m deeply flawed and imperfect, I can only be productive. Leisure and self-happiness are postponed until once I’m perfect. It’s unreasonable for them to judge someone for working on their self, but it’s reasonable to judge someone who doesn’t deserve to be happy with the knowledge that they are not perfect. 

When people ask about my hobbies, I only give a short answer. I don’t want to be judged for being more happy than I deserve. The other hobbies I’m fine doing as an imperfect human being, but I hide myself. I don’t want to be seen happy when I don’t deserve it. 

I wanted to ask for help because I think it’s toxic to punish myself like this, because not all people think like this. But I do, and it’s crippling me. 

That’s the reason why I haven’t done things I want to do and just keep a list of things I want to do. But I feel like it’s a waste of time. I have to address this crippling mindset as soon as possible.

How do I deal with this problem? I know I shouldn’t think this way because I’d be a prisoner to other opinions, but it’s been years. I haven’t overcome it. I wish I did. ",1711162673.0,

And as a child, he always kept me interested and focused on interesting things. I hated school, but I made and still make really good grades. When I was younger, it was almost effortless to pass my classes, mostly I would goof off and copy papers, but I knew I was smart enough to do the work if I really wanted to. So I guess after he passed away, I was kind of left stranded. I've always known i've been a little different, it's like im always thinking  and it doesn't stop, and if I get bored ill start ""dissecting"" whatever I'm looking at to interest me.

&#x200B;

Before my dad died, I loved the way my brain made connections and was always thinking like I loved myself so much in that regard and not even in a bragging way I have almost always stayed humble about it. 

&#x200B;

After he passed away, I got sent down a spiral of sorts, my mother got hard into drugs and I was sent to live with my grandparents, then she got clean and I got sent back to live with my mom (where I've been residing ever since).

&#x200B;

My mother is different, she used to be my ""hell on earth"" even when dad was alive, she was always out doing drugs and cheating on him when he was grinding his ass off away from home working. Come to find out, she fits every single label of a narcissist out there so basically from the age of 10 besides the time I lived at my grandparents house I have had no father figure and no real parental love or guidance.

&#x200B;

All I could think about constantly was how horrible my life was, and how it was all constantly crashing down. I did research into psychedelic mushrooms and went and picked and tried some myself to see if It would benefit my anxiety and what at the time I thought was depression (probably was to be completely real).

&#x200B;

 Anyways, it was probably about 3 grams and at the time I was overweight so it wasn't exactly a heroic dose of a trip. This was the first drug I ever tried, and I don't regret it. Basically the shrooms screamed at me that I need to get and stay out of the house and have some fun while i'm still a kid since rotting at home wasn't making me happy in any way.

&#x200B;

Long story short, this lead to a snowball effect of fun times, making lifelong friends, and also trying and LOVING zaza, and trying and sadly getting addicted to nicotine (although it helps with my focus I suppose)

&#x200B;

BUT THEN I MOVED  and I had to restart all of the progress I had made socially and this lead to the worst depression I have ever faced. Right after I moved my mom caught me smoking some zaza  and did NOT react accordingly. She belittled me and mentally tortured me for months and months and this led to me becoming sad to the point I had thoughts about hurting myself (i told my mom in a serious way that and she completely disregarded it). 

&#x200B;

I absolutely fucking hated my life, and all kinds of horrible crazy shit happened after this, but it ended (somehow and through regrettably pure manipulation) with me being able to smoke at the house as long as I maintained my job and grades. (i was doing that ANYWAYS!!!)

&#x200B;

The sticky green stuff made me super introspective compared to how I used to be, now instead of thinking and thinking about whatever daydream I was caught in at the time, I began thinking about the idea of time and how it subjectively flows for me depending on how happy/interested I was. I think about my thoughts, and I think about me thinking thoughts about my thoughts.

 

If I do have ADHD, zaza has done nothing but made it worse, but to be honest it has been the only way for me to cope with my mothers bullshit. (alcohol is amazing for my anxiety but hangovers are not, and also I don't want to kill my fucking braincells and liver.)

&#x200B;

Okay now that I'm tired of spewing out my lore ill try to explain what I experience.

&#x200B;

I lose track of time very quickly, If I don't have a watch constantly I will miss things. I'm horrible at keeping relationships, like that whole out of site out of mind thing, but like times 100. Relationships with females has been completely an utterly useless venture. I attract plenty of women, i'm 6'4 at 17 years old and I look like my dad. 

&#x200B;

Recently, I went to work, after getting a coffee from starbucks (I literally just learned in the past few months how beneficial caffeine really is for the structure of my thoughts) and met this girl that works with me. I had the best conversation I had had with anybody in months and she gave me her number at the end of the shift

&#x200B;

did I mention It's hard for me to talk to people because they aren't interesting to me? I can't focus on conversation at all- in fact ill be looking like im listening to someone but im really just stuck inside my head thinking about whatever, then i always ALWAYS have to say HUH? WHAT DID YOU SAY? IM SORRY IM INCAPABLE OF HEARING YOU!

&#x200B;

And sometimes that happens like 3 times until i can understand their meaning. its like listening to how the parents talk on of those old cartoon shows where they were always just out of frame, like mumbling and i cannot understand you sorryyy. I suck and am afraid of talking to people because people get the idea that my brain is empty and that i'm slow but truthfully I'm just not present in the conversation

&#x200B;

So I pulled the coworker right, and I kind of always attributed it to the caffeine, because it basically unlocked my ability to hold a steady conversation. And we were talking for a few days perfectly fine and it was going great. But then I just didn't text her for two days. I think its because I straight up couldn't focus on her during our facetimes.

&#x200B;

okay I need to end this unorganized ass post quickly so ill just shoot off a few more thoughts and I would like some opinions on my situation from yall, it would prove helpful even if what I receive makes me realize some bad things about myself or whatever.

&#x200B;

When I was younger, i used to count my steps walking down sidewalks, only 2 steps between each crack I would tell myself, and it made me look stupid as hell when I walked for a while because I couldn't help but count the steps and force only 2 step between each line on the sidewalk.

&#x200B;

I also used to have the habit of kinda bouncing when I walked, people always would tell me it just looked like I was happy or stepping to the beat of a song or something.

&#x200B;

Also just in general today when I walk it looks more normal, but I can't listen to music in my earbuds when I walk or I start fucking my pace up because I try to match my pace to the beat of the song. No matter how hard I have tried to change this part of myself, I can't get that out of me

&#x200B;

Oh, and i procrastinate like a MF. For example,  Ill be watching tiktok on my bed, look at the time and it'll say 3:27 and Ill tell myself ""Okay at 3:30 I'll go do this thing that needs doing"" then i go back to tik tok, and the next time i glance back at the time its 3:32. 

&#x200B;

Then I say i'll get up at 3:35, next thing you know its 3:38 and I have to wait until 3:40 to stand up. I think this could be some typa ocd symptom or something, im not sure. But what I do know is I will lay in my bed for hours doing this when all I needed to do was the 3 minute task of putting some clothes in the wash.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Meditation HELPS with what I have for sure but only temporarily.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Okay, I'm officially done. I guess what i'm looking for reply wise is some advice and some insight into what I've said from the perspective of someone who is formally diagnosed with ADHD or just anyone in general with knowledge about ADHD.

&#x200B;

I don't wanna look like one of those people who are self diagnosing a mental illness for coping reasons, I know what I am, a kid who is struggling with some bullshit (probably the same bullshit that lead to my fathers nolife at 37yo) Luckily, at the end of April I have my first appointment with a psychiatrist, so hopefully beyond that point I will begin to learn more about myself.

(I""m being somewhat vague in case, by chance, he reads this post).

Nobody has confronted him that his delusions aren't real.  Should we?

What can I and another friend do to get him the help he needs?  (Basically everybody else has turned their back on him).  He fully believes his delusions so there's no chance of convincing him to get help.  IMO he needs to be on medication which, hopefully, will make him realize all this has been in his head.

This is in Florida.

Is there a way to get him committed?  Is there anything the public defender can do?  His crime wasn't serious so I doubt he'll do time in jail but he did spend a month in jail for this before he bonded out and he was delusional before and after prison so I don't think he's doing drugs...I think it's a legit mental breakdown.

StayingUp4AFeeling,"I'm safe now, so it's like the dam holding the emotions back has burst...",2,1bl03cx,1,"This post may be upsetting because it discusses the topic of suicide attempts in the past. It's not graphic, I assure you.

--/

Seven months ago, I tried to kill myself.

In the immediate aftermath, I was relieved to be alive, but soon regressed back to suicidality.

I then decided that I would fight to live on for the sake of those who cared for me, but with no intrinsic desire to remain alive.

Now, finally, after all this time, I can say that I want to stay for this show -- for my own self.

And suddenly, there's a whole bunch of things happening. I'm getting intrusive images which are both memories and visions of my death. I instinctively wince at these before I realise what has happened. My heartbeat goes supersonic and my face becomes as hot as a summer day. I even lose my balance sometimes.

Emotionally, there's multiple issues:

1. There was a significant duration in which I thought that I was going to die and that no amount of medical help could change that. Just experiencing that has changed me.

2. Physiologically speaking, I don't know how I am alive. I'm not being dramatic here. I didn't gently approach the line between life and death and then back off. I ran full speed towards that line, too fast to stop. And yet, here I am.

3. When I think of what would have happened after I had died, if I had died, my eyes must up. I feel guilty, utterly guilty, when I think of what mum, dad, sis, and friends would have had to go through if I had died. Including the discovery of the body, the last rites... And their grief. Their self blame. My throat's going all chokey as I type this.

4. I'm terrified that my demons will return to finish what they started. There's nothing too substantial keeping the lid on them.

So, yeah. All this is swirling in my heart.

I know I need a trauma therapist, but apart from that.... What do I do? How do I forgive myself? How do I stop seeing myself as being a bad person for what I've done?",1711116431.0,

Garsonist,I’ve learned to be a more confident person,1,1bl1n9b,0,"Honestly, recently, I’ve learned what helps me be more confident, and I want to share it. You can try it if you wish to, but I will preface that while it works for me, it might not work for you.

As of lately, I’ve discovered faking confidence totally works. It's sort of a fake it till you make it situation. Though, I will also attribute it to my bipolar disorder, which is what helped me teach myself how to do it. For once, it benefited me.

So, I had a pretty severe hypomanic episode that did increase my confidence, and I discovered I often got more of what I wanted and also had improved relationships from it. At first, it was disappointing since it made me feel like people liked me more in that state than in other states.

After the episode ended, I missed that confidence and wanted to have it, so I decided to pretend to have it. At first, it was awkward, and there were moments when I second-guessed myself. But every time something went right, it just made me feel good, and it taught me actually to be confident.

I’ve been significantly more happy with life. I’ve become more of an ambivert versus an introvert, and I have overcome my generalized anxiety disorder for the most part. It’s still there, but I have the strength to persevere now.

I have heard faking confidence can be exhausting for some people, so again, it might not work for you, but I only found it energizing. Yesterday, I even asked for a raise at work, and I’m almost guaranteed to get it. I was honestly a bit terrified, but I pretended to be confident, and afterward, I felt on top of the world.

I have gained better relationships with most people, and work makes me happy most of the time. I enjoy hanging out with my coworkers, and I’m pretty sure they like me. I work at an old folk’s home, and the residents enjoy me a lot, too. I’m able to be more open about myself.

On top of this, I’ve found something I’m passionate about and am changing career paths. I wanted to do forensics, but now I want to be an animator.

I will be honest when I say my medications haven’t been working well, and I need to get that sorted out, but I can tell I’m having genuine happiness versus hypomania.

I just wanted to ramble about this because I’m very happy currently. Again, I don’t know if faking confidence would work for everyone, but it’s worth a try if you want to. It was difficult at first, but now I have a much easier time, and now I hardly have to fake it.

Also, I hope all of you are doing well or improving. I honestly was a complete mess in high school, and at age 14, I lost the will to live and never got it back until now, at age 22. I wasn’t suicidal or depressed the whole time, but I just didn’t care about living. But finally, I want to live and enjoy life.

I want to say that no matter how difficult it gets, it will always get better. Your life may feel over, but you can always return from it. It takes a lot of effort, but everyone can do it. No one is a lost cause. I’ll end this here. I hope all of you have a good day.",1711120459.0,

I haven't felt this in years. My brain just let go of everything and I was feeling such peace.

Conscious_Apple_5918,Am I Turning In to a Toxic Person? How do I stop?,4,1bkgz5c,1," To sum it up, recently I have found my self being overly critical and judgmental of everything and everyone, including unfortunately my Mom who I love the most in this world. I contantly fear that she will die, or something will happen to her and that I will have no one left. She has given up far too much of her life to raise me and I feel guilty all the time that she gave up a good life to have me when she insists otherwise. My father and I have never had a good relationship because he constantly neglected and ignored my Mother and I, being harsh, toxic, and mean instead of supportive and kind at every turn. He dumps a lot of responsibility on my Mom to the point that she is overwhelmed, and refused to take respnsibility for anything except making money. Recently, it has gotten a lot worse as he took on a rental home he could not handle and now it needs to be renovated and sold. In spite of that she constantly defends him and refuses to accept that he is a bad father and husband. All this to say, my Mom and I are very dependent on each other emotionally. I am an only child and we have no extended family in the U.S. for support. I have been in and out of jobs for the past two years and living at home, and it's been very rough. But I am finally going to law school this fall. However, recently I have found myself being more and more critical of my Mom to the point that sometimes she has mental breakdowns. I want to stop but I do not know how. I am getting a consultation for therapy next week but it is so expensive. She is my everything and I hate to see her like this. I will acknowledge that when I was younger and even now she tries to control a lot of what I do (which I sometimes resent) but that does not excuse my behavior. I feel like my being critical of her is me trying to take back control over little things because I haven't felt heard or appreciated by my Dad, and in a smaller way resent the control she has had over my life in the past and how she has tried to exert some of it now because that's how she was raised.

Dazzling-Lion806,Acute psychosis,2,1bkgr9a,0,"This past July, I fell into complete acute psychosis. I was hospitalized in a state hospital. I was in acute psychosis for three months straight. I have no memory of this time Towards the end of my hospital stay, I became aware of who I was, and I wanted to go home. Within five days I was discharged. It was a very difficult discharge. I think that my family was in shock that I even recovered. They were not welcoming to me when I wanted to re-enter my life again. I have overcome many hurdles, and I'm now only feeling comfortable with llife. I have a life to live, but a lot has changed. About 90% of the people in my life have turned their backs on me. Maybe I scare them? I can't worry about that now. I need to keep living. 

How long does it take to recover from acute psychosis? Especially when it lasted as long as mine did? I now only have the support of a new therapist and my daughter. I also have some support from a sister. this sister lives long distance from me. She has recently texted me that she doesn't want to have regular contact with me because I seem to be unstable.

BiggieCheese105,I want to get worse ,2,1bkfjx9,5,"Back in mid November of last year, I was admitted to a psych ward for a suicide attempt. I learned some things about myself while I was in there and I had been on a pretty consistent uphill climb with my mental health since I got out, of course I had some occasional ups and downs, but nothing too dramatic. About a month ago now, I made the mistake of going off my meds for about a week and though I hadn't started to get worse yet, I knew I needed to get back on them and did; however, I started to get worse as I got back on them, experiencing extreme anxiety attacks which I had had very little experiences of before. Now I know this can be par for the course since being on and off meds is not good for you, but my psychiatrist recommended some anti-anxiety pills and up to my antidepressant dose. The anxiety attacks continued for a bit but have died down now. The problem I'm having now is that everything in my life is going great, I've been with my girlfriend for the last 2 months and our relationship has been lovely (part of the reason why I forgot to take my meds for about a week because I was doing so well), and I don't have any cut and clear issues to be upset about at the moment, but I want to get worse.

English is not my first language

I've been struggling with my mental health since I was little my dad has always been an alcoholic and violent it got worse and worse so my mom ended up separating from him but he still had partial custody and normal weekends with me. It was hell to be with him he beat his girlfriend constantly in front of my eyes, insulted her until he did it to me too (cps didn't do anything he also allowed a convicted child molester to be near me and also to leave me alone with him you can imagine what happened). In 2018 I had my first suicide attempt and unfortunately failed I never told anyone and in the years I had repeated attempts that never worked. My mom and my dog were the only support I had. My mom got sick in 2020. In 2022 my mother slowly went blind and my stepfather took advantage of her going blind and stole money from her permanently and didn't give a damn about her. In 2023 my mother was hospitalized directly on the icu and died a few weeks later. Seeing my mother like that still hurts extremely, especially being there when she took her last breath. I've also been homeless since my mother died. My suicidal thoughts are now extremely bad again but I know I have to keep living because nobody can look after my dog. I just had to get it off my chest. 
By the way, I am diagnosed with bpd, ptsd, anxiety disorders and major depression. I am not medicated but I have already sought help.

Due_Description_5445,what is wrong with me?,2,1bk45qa,1,"I (17M) feels like my life is just a whole curse.
When I was 5 my parents had a divorce and then when I turned 7 my mother passed away because of an illness,1 week later I haven't even done grieving my mother's death and I got raped by my neighbor.

I grew up being a quiet, fearful, and anxious kid because of that, so since elementary to high school I don't have a friend and not a single person came to talk to me or even initiate to be a friend. I don't know what is wrong with me, is it because I am too quiet?.

I was bullied all throughout school too because Im very quiet, and because of that I always came from school to home crying, but unfortunately my family didn't understand and just mad and sometimes hit me or verbally abuse me.

Oh and when I was in highschool I remember I was a patient in a mental hospital for 3 weeks because of a suicide attempt and people in my school know it so all of them avoiding me when I came back to school. and being gay just make it worse, no one seems to be interested in me in school, I use dating app tho but people from there just make my mental worse causes they only use me for my body.

I don't fucking know what's happening but I don't feel real and I feel insane. I tried so hard to be better but nothing works.

This made me start acting crazy and i decided i would just do what i wanted because why not? In my mind i was a horrible rotten person who couldn’t be helped. I felt so guilty and thought i was the reason my family would fight. But i was broken and couldn’t be fixed so nothing mattered.  I started using drugs and almost died from an overdose less than a year later. I guess before then though i would cut myself when i made a mistake. What i mean by mistake is if i caught myself being a selfish asshole. Im now 18 and have tried to become a better person. Its never right though. I yell and scream and cry when i get into a fight with my parents. Sometimes i feel I cant ever be in a relationship because im afraid i would abuse them. Its honestly hard to write this because i cant get my thoughts straight but im trying. These days im constantly alone and at home. Im too paranoid to leave the house because i think everyone knows that im a narcissist and has it out for me. Sometimes ill stay up all night thinking people will be trying to break in my house if i go to sleep. I dont use drugs anymore just weed on and off. i have these thoughts that tell me every thing i do is because im a narcissist. “You only said that to be nice” or “You’re so selfish only thinking of yourself 24/7. do you even realize there are people around you” or “you think you really care about these people?

sinnamonsticks,I believe he has a severe mental illness ,1,1bjwkm3,4,"I'm (22F) a BSW student completing my practicum at a mental health facility that houses chronic and debilitating mental illness.  Many of these people exhibit behaviors that remind me so much of my ex, who is currently a 32M.  The age gap of course was inappropriate in retrospect, but he never seemed to really be bothered by it other than the fact that we had different interests, so at the time we dated, I convinced myself that it must be alright. 

Let me start this off by saying: I am very well aware of the trope that once a person starts to work in the mental health field, that they start to diagnose everyone in their life. I try very hard to refrain from this, but he has always been so incredibly unstable the entire time I've known him, that it just keeps me up at night trying to fathom what the hell his diagnoses must be, because I just can't comprehend it. 

I don't even know where to get started, but I'm going to try to list the symptoms he has from each diagnosis I have considered. 

While he doesn't have any positive symptoms of Schizophrenia, he tends to have all the negative symptoms of Schizophrenia: anhedonia, flat affect, avolition, disorganized attention and behavior 
When I say flat affect, I mean he shows zero emotion 90% of the time. To the point where sometimes I was a bit scared he genuinely wasn't feeling anything at all, and it was almost eerie to look him in the eyes. He wasn't like this all the time, sometimes he could be more expressive and happy. 

BPD: Since this disorder stems from failure to attach to primary caregiver(s) and trauma, I will be talking about that. He consistently will cut off people, and soon after frantically try to make amends. He did it to me, he has done it to his friends, and even his own parents. 

He stated that he wasn't ever abused as a child significantly, but that he was ""shunned"" by his classmates, and they would make fun of him.  

Here are some examples of his unstable relationships, and the reasons as to why he has cut people off: His mother is a firm Christian, he is not. So he claims that he can't receive comfort from her emotionally because she finds comfort from religion.  I can understand that this is frustrating, but it just seems so strange to me that this is seemingly reason enough to cut her off. His mother even messaged me and stated that this is unfortunately normal for him, and that he has a tendency to abruptly cut her off because she has different morals than he does.  

While we were dating, he abused drugs like nicotine, alcohol, and weed to, ""hide the fact that he wasn't happy in the relationship"". I broke up with him, because why would I want to be with someone who isn't happy with me?
...he has felt so drastically about me ever since.  I moved on to a different relationship, and he has sent me messages that flip back and forth between ""I know you've moved on but I still want a future with you"", to, ""I don't want a relationship but I want to be sexual with you if you'd consider opening your relationship"". I've blocked him since, as it's incredibly inappropriate for me to be receiving messages like this from my ex now that I'm in a happy, healthy relationship. 

He also has never had a stable job, which is something I recognize is common in people with BPD. Every job he has applied for and every career path he has taken, ""doesn't feel right"". He stated that that he would ""rather just die"" than work a full time job.  He truly believes that the majority of society is either dumb, or that they are lying to themselves about how miserable they are. 

Substance Use: He has used weed every single day (with some breaks that lasted a few months) for the past 10+ years. He doesn't always drink alcohol, but when he does, he goes so overboard.  He also claims that he used nicotine as a ""self harm"". 

If I can think of anything else, or if anyone has any questions, I can follow up in the comments.

Crazy_Dog_Mama3201,My adhd partner is destroying our relationship and I don’t know what to do,1,1bju5k3,2,"So, here I am now. My partner (f54) of 7 years has adhd. In the beginning of our relationship she told me about it. Told me she takes meds etc. If she started acting weird and having symptoms, I was supposed to tell her, and she is “really good about dealing with it”
5 years in, her meds stopped working, and she basically abused me for 6 months. I had to call her parents to help because she was completely unreasonable. She then went to doc, figured out what was going on with meds, and started therapy once a week. That was working! We could communicate without her constantly interrupting me and would actually listen.   Therapist had her change her diet. I guess they need protein in the AM and now carbs.  Again, this was all working…..until: she quit therapy, changed meds, stopped morning meditation, started eating shit in the AM again.
Now, she is even worse than before. She had a MAJOR meltdown because I told her she hurt my feelings when she walked away in the middle of a sentence. Major meltdown, horrible, vicious, verbal abuse. Horrible!  Screaming yelling crying tantrum like a toddler…for hours. Somehow “you hurt my feelings” turned into “I am breaking up with you” in her head. She went into a total delusion.
Her family is zero help (maybe they are sick of this shit). She called MY family and told them that it was ME having a mental breakdown!!! She projected it ALL on me. She went to her shrink, who told her she was “fine” her meds were “fine” . No…they are not fine! Why don’t these people talk to the partner? 
I am in the middle of chaos with my family (elderly parents, sick sibling, etc) and do not need this right now. 
She is causing SO much anxiety in my life!!! 
We have this huge trip planned with another couple. I can’t be stuck with her in this state on this trip. I’m ready to cancel her portion. 
She has found a “couples counselor” for us and we are going next week. In the meantime, she will be staying in the guesthouse so we have space from one another.
Does ANYONE have any advice? I’m just at a loss of what to do. There is just so much more…I could write a book at this point.
Do these people do this on purpose so that we break up with them because they are unhappy and don’t know how to get out? Is it just symptoms of this disorder???

Fearless-Bell-8827,Is weed making me go mad? Heard my mate in the woods.,2,1bjk6jx,7," 

Last weekend I was super high with my mates in the woods we went camping.  
A couple days before that I had a bad time with edibles so I was a little on edge.

So we got to the campsite and sparked up about 6 pre-rolls for the four of us. Then we took a fair amount of edible each 85 mg. I was starting to get a little anxious about my high.

Then I got lost in the woods and this really created some anxiety and it took me 30 minutes to get back to the campsite. By that time it was roughly 3 in the morning so we decided to go to bed.  
While laying in bed I was super anxious about everything and hypersensitive to everything. I almost thought I heard one of my mates outside walking and faintly laughing. When I went to get out of my tent it stopped and then I got out of my tent to find he was dead asleep and I woke him up and he said he had been asleep. This led to a panic attack and I slept it off.

I've always suffered from anxiety. I really struggle with work and people. But honestly, I don't think people notice. Outside, I'm a very social and pleasant person, but inside, I'm struggling. I always think people are angry with me. When I say or write something, I fear that I've said something wrong. Because of that, I've had bad reactions. My only advantage is that I don't trust myself.

Anxiety is getting worse with age. Now I'm doing some weird things when no one is around, like making repetitive sounds or impulsive movements; it makes me feel better. But I'm afraid to lose control and do it in public.

I also noticed that I can't stand small intrusive noises like ""chips"" at the cinema. I can't focus with it.

On top of everything, I can tell this is affecting my partner now too. He is my safe place, but I know I’m draining him. He doesn’t know what to do, he doesn’t understand what I’m going through, and I’m scared this is changing the way he feels about me. 

It just gets worse and worse and I don’t know what the endgame will be. I feel so alone. I don’t understand why I feel this why and why it won’t just go away. New parts of my show up everyday that I have to try to learn how to control and deal with. I’ve never been like *this*. I just keep thinking of how easy it would be to rid myself of this. This is hell on earth. 

I am so lost and scared. And all of the advice is always “see a professional”, but what am I supposed to do if that isn’t an option? I’m scared for my life. ",1710942077.0,

lluna_moth,what’s wrong with me??,5,1bj1t93,10,"so I’m 14f, and my mental health issues recently kicked up in 8th grade (which was last year). And now that I’m in high school they have been so much worse. The most prominent of the issues is my derealization and depersonalization. I’ve had this for a while, but now it is completely unlivable. I feel like an empty shell of a person, but at the same time I feel so complex and deep. I don’t feel right in my skin. And sometimes my vision will go blurry and I won’t be able to feel my own self. I have this sense of impending doom all the time and I have suicidal thoughts a lot. I also tend to have very violent and intrusive thoughts. I tried to go to therapy but all of that felt like surface things. I feel like something is deeply wrong with my brain. I don’t feel real most of the time. And when I start researching about it, I fall into another dissociative episode. Like I am now. What is wrong with me? Is dissociation a symptom of depression? And I’m not even sure I’m depressed, I mean I have no reason to be depressed. But I feel like I’m living inside my mind. Something feels very wrong but I don’t know what it is. I also struggle with existential isolation a lot. (Which is one of my main problems). And I can’t talk about it because it’s super hard to explain what I’m feeling and it doesn’t even make sense. I’ve sensed that something was wrong with me for a while. I’ve also felt like I’m different or more in touch with the world than everyone else. I feel like a dissociative and delusion psychopath.

I know it's hard but just for a moment, put all problems aside. Stop running scenarios and memories.

""I am here. I am now. I am safe"". Repeat. 

STOP. Just freeze. Your mind and your body. Look around and find no current and immediate threat to your life.

Slow your breath, breathe a bit deeper because a brain without oxygen doesn't do much rationalizing, only panicking. Fuller, slower breathes. Don’t stop. 

Relax your tense muscles. You're in fight or flight, your body is geared up. We're ""un-gearing"" it.

Find something in every color of the rainbow. Red.
Orange. Yellow. Etc..

Feel your feet on the floor. Really pay attention to them. Feel the floor, grass, shoes.

""I am here. I am now. I am safe"".



Live in the immediate present moment as much as you can. The past is f’d up, it's not safe there. The future seems insurmountable, uncertain, like you're only ever going to feel the way you do right now (which isn't true!!!). And how are we supposed to live if it's always that way. The future is filled with too many variables and uncertainties, it's not safe either. (You can worry about the future when you are finally stable and come out on the other side of this shit show.)
One day at a time can be way too much sometimes.
Focus on the RIGHT NOW. Focus on calming your body and your mind will eventually follow. 
Even if that's all you do, all day every day. THAT'S OKAY!!! We hold ourselves to the highest expectation and we need to learn to give ourselves some grace during our healing journey. You've been through some traumatizing shit, I'm sure. This is how your mind and body survived. You're here now. And you're safe. And you will get through it. Just take care of your body the best you can. Try to love it even when you hate it. And the same thing goes for your mind.",1710859909.0,

crnnaaa,"Extremely terrified of dying, I need help.",3,1binl3a,2,"Hi all,

For many years I’ve ben very scared of dying and death. Almost my entire life I’ve had (and still have) severe nightmares about dying in the most horrific way and I feel like it has come to a climax where I can’t feel happy anymore. The thing that scares me the most is not knowing what happens when we die. I have multiple fears of what happens when I die that haunt me every day. During the night I wake up crying and begging that I don’t want to die and that I’m so scared for when that day comes.

My fear of dying is getting more and more extreme slowly but surely. I can’t enjoy being with friends or do anything fun. When I’m at the gym I have multiple times where I have to compose myself to not have a panic attack thinking about death. But where does it end? Does it end with me becoming too scared to even leave my house? And being extremely obsessed about it?
Thinking about death is something that just hits me, it’s like my brain wants to torture me and I don’t understand why.

I’ve had 3 types of medication (don’t know which ones) in the past that were supposed to help with my nightmares, but no result.

For my depression I’ve had Mirtazapine but that multiplied my nightmares (and weight) so I had to quit.

I’ve reached the end of the line in psychiatric treatment (group therapy, exposure therapy, EMDR therapy etc) last year (for other psychological complaints) where the national mental health care institution doesn’t want to help me anymore because they’re out of options (even though I’ve suggested several other therapy methods). They’ve completely dropped me against my will.

I have a one-time appointment with a psychiatrist (hopefully soon) and I’m hoping this person wants to help me with medication, because I can’t live like this anymore. I’m exhausted.

Are there any other people struggling with this fear? If so, what helps you? I need all the tips I can get.

Thank you <3!

Diagnoses I’ve gotten the last 10 years:
- Chronic depression
- complex PTSD (depends who you’re asking tho, not every psychologist I’ve spoke to agrees with this due to the lack of flashbacks)
- anxiety disorder

so i guess i have a problem with lying about little things that literally don't matter. it's not even conscious it just comes out because i'm scared of whoever i'm speaking to being mad at me (i have an irrational fear of making people upset with me or being mad at me at all; it's crippling and dictates everything i do and is one of the effects of my diagnosed bipolar 1 disorder lol).
when i get actually caught in one of the little lies i just literally want to kill myself lol. even if the other person is the person closest to me i never even want to see them again lmao. once again, obviously not the other person's fault at all i just do this in the first place without thought because i literally can't handle the pressure of someone being mad at me or the feeling that i've upset someone.

basically my question is how do i get over these feelings of humiliation after being caught in a stupid fucking lie lol

Hey guys I took a fat edible Delta 8 100 mg (30% THC) and (1%) CBD.  I also ingested roughly 300 mg of caffeine throughout the day because it was the end of finals and then another 120 while high.

I was really anxious going into the high and realized initially I took too much and tried to make myself throw up.  Then I was playing video games by myself and took off my headphones and heard real voices outside my apartment which I was so high and on edge I thought I hallucinated them.  Then I went to check and saw people walking around in the hallway.

This still put me on edge although.  I then put on my headphones again and took them off roughly 3 hours later and heard indistinct voices (no actual words, feelings, delusions, ETC).  I was so tired, my tinnitus was so loud, and I was so anxious that I went into a panic attack because I thought I was hallucinating.  What I was hearing persisted till I fell asleep roughly 20 minutes later.  

I went to my psych and told him about it **I have OCD** and he said that I have nothing to worry about and that indistinct sounds can be attributed to high anxiety/stress plus the psychoactive effects of THC.  But now when I get really obsessive about hearing stuff I can almost hear stuff again.  It really freaks me out and I don't know what to do.  I told my psychiatrist in a later visit about this, and he said the same thing and that I was nowhere close to DSM-5 for psychosis.  But the sober almost voices in white noise/anxiety/tinnitus really messes with me.  I am so scared I am in psychosis and IDK what to do.  My therapist who studied about psychosis and ocd relationship said the same thing.  Am I missing something here?",1710876417.0,

I started betting December of 2022, it wasn't anything crazy and I was using the promotions and winning a little bit of pocket change. Little did I know it would be the start of the end. Within the end of 2023 to now 2024 I have lost everything. I go to college with my moms help but I have betrayed her and used the money they gave me to gamble. Even in college I delayed my graduation significantly because of my lack of self restraint and stupidity to go to class. I know I am a worthless human being, I don't deserve to have her as a parent and as a son I am so fucking useless. Worst of all we are not rich, this is only possible because of how hard my mother works and I don't know why I keep doing what I do.

I don't know what to do now that I have lost the most amount of money I can possibly imagine from her and she still does not know, I don't ever want to bring it up to her that I lost this because I know it will hurt her so much and it literally kills me to think of that happening. After im done some days I just hit myself and question why and why I do this to myself every single day. She will find out because she checks the account about once a month so I have a month before she finds out. I know I am another shameless person asking for help and why should you give a dumbfuck of a person like me any sort of help but Id do anything for her not to find out about what I have done.

Puzzled_Jello_6592,If you could go back in time what would you tell your younger self?,3,1bi159u,11,"I (27f) reflect on my life and imagine what it would be like if I went back in time and had the opportunity to talk to my 16 year old self. I wonder if there is anything I could say to her, knowing what I know now, that would make life a little less hard for her. 

A decade ago, I didn’t even see a sliver of the world to know I didn’t want to be a part of it. I was very far gone, suicidal, and so far down the spiral of depression that I couldn’t see past a few days into my future. Despite the therapy, medical professionals, peers and family support, advice or direction, there was nothing anyone could say that resonated with me. At that time of my life I was lost, and without hope. The biggest turning point for me was getting on the right meds. When I finally had the right cocktail (around age 19), it felt easier to relate to some of the things my therapist and family / friends would say. I felt more open to new ideas and was able to take some different perspectives I wasn’t able to take before. The meds are the foundation of my mental health journey, as the rest wouldn’t exist without it. 

When I reflect my mid-teen years, I wonder if there is ANYTHING that ANYONE could have said that would have made life a little less hopeless and/or hard. I know that if I went back and said “don’t worry, things will get better!” I’d call my older self a liar. To be honest, if I time traveled, I would know all of the things NOT to say to my 16 year old self. But I’m not sure what WOULD say. I feel like there might not have been any words that would’ve helped, that maybe I wouldn’t say something, I would just be present with her.

It started out with slight paranoia and anxiety, I thought it would go away in a few days. It never did, it got worse and continues to progress. 

I am living in constant fear. I cannot shake the feeling that something is about to happen and it’s debilitating. New fears every single day, so many things that could go wrong. I am absolutely and utterly terrified to the I can barely do anything anymore, including taking care of myself and my home. Nothing is enjoyable anymore because there are so many things that could go wrong. I’m extremely distrustful of people even if I know they have my best interest. Sometimes I hear noises that aren’t there. I can barely sleep, barely eat. It’s effecting my relationship because I don’t have the capacity to cook & clean and I can’t take my mind off of it long enough to have sex. I feel like my mind is turning on me. I can’t even put into words the way I have been feeling. This is crippling.

ReasonableBroccoli98,Does anyone else have on and off sadism?,4,1bhvvpi,3,"This is a really difficult thing for me to talk about and has honestly created huge identity issues in me. But for my whole life I’ve seemed to have some level of sadism (not in a sexual way). It definitely exploded when I had my first mental breakdown at 14.

I’ve done many regrettable things but luckily managed to get it under control for the most part a couple years ago. The thing about it is that it isn’t a constant in me.

Most of the time I’m very sensitive to what other people feel and hate upsetting people at all and will feel horribly guilty if I do. But it’s just like sometimes I’ll feel this strange presence inside me and it just turns off like a switch.

I’ll stop caring and even get enjoyment from seeing people hurt. I’ll also get terrible cravings to harm people. Though nowadays I usually just vent through fictional material as a way of staving it off.

Btw when I say presence it feels like there’s a second person inside me that differs than me quite a bit. I also noticed it sort of feels like a man when I am a woman. I do feel gender identity issues sometimes whilst like this. It’s just very confusing.

Btw I do need to say it’s not harm OCD, it is genuine sadism. And while I’m having these episodes I feel zero remorse for what I do. I have also acted on some of the violent urges which is something that doesn’t happen in OCD cases. I also do want to say I don’t think it’s DID either cause that wouldn’t make sense. And I also don’t think I’m actually possessed by anything because I don’t really believe in that. And it’s not like I lose control of my body.

The most I can call it is a passive influence on my behaviors and mental state. I should state I’m bipolar but these seem separate from my episodes. I’ve had them during and not during episodes. Though, I will say the feeling of sadism I get feels similar to my hypomania. But again I get it outside of episodes and before I was bipolar.

Honestly, I do think I’m a bad person, but I’m not suicidal or depressed over it. Also, I am planning on talking to my therapist about this but she’s on vacation and our appointment isn’t till the 9th of April. So there’s no need to tell me I need to talk to a professional, I do know.

But I’m just wondering if anyone ever feels like there’s another person inside of them or some weird personality traits that come and go randomly. I’m fine with suggestions on things to do or possible explanations for this all. Thanks to everyone who responds.",1710781539.0,

However in the past year, maybe a little longer, I've lost both my dad and most recent stepdad and I kind of just didn't care.  My dad was terrible and had very little to do with me so I skipped his funeral, have been basically joking about his passing with my gf(I know that's messed up, but he's a terrible person and it helps me cope with the trauma I have surrounding him), and only teared up a little when I saw a pic of a younger me with him.  Not cause I cared about him, but because it hurt that he never tried.  My only regret has been never telling him how much he sucks.

My stepdad treated me like crap, so his passing didn't hurt either, but I went to his funeral for my mom and kept how I felt to myself.  Been joking about his passing too(same thing I said about my dad).  Cried when I saw my family was crying because I hate seeing them upset, but again his death meant nothing to me essentially and I'm happy he can't treat me bad anymore.

I have no skills, and no real means of gaining any, not that I could actually apply them anywhere anyway.

I'm on my fourth attempt at getting a degree in political science with a piss poor GPA. I don't know why I'm even trying.

,I enjoy hurting/retraumatizing myself with dark content. It feels like the only thing that allows me to completely relax. Anyone experienced anything like that? ,2,1bgx93l,0,"Hello guys! 

I have many issues (addiction, ADHD, c - ptsd, social phobia, generalized anxiety, depression, BPD). I am tense and anxious 24/7 and 8 have hard time relaxing. 

My typical ""relax"" is: 

a) Watching youtube videos about true crime, internet mysteries and horrors, pedophila cases/pedophile rings, shock documentaries 

b) Looking up facts about dark stuff - war history, people who killed themselves, genocides, massacres... etc. 

c) Browsing the worst 4chan boards, incel threads, political sites filled with absolute vitriol

d) Watching dark anime, TV shows, psychedelic shows, playing games that will leave you scared or unsettled, quiestioning yourself (like SOMA, P.T., Layers of Fear)

e) Reading dead dove fanfiction, dark books, either fictional (Osamu Dazai, Bukowski) or non fiction about nihilistic/existential philosophies.


To summarize it, my relax is dark, obscure and unsettling stuff that brings out my negative feelings and often things that bring out my old trauma. 

I was a daycare worker, I volunteer, all my friends and family say I am a total sunshine, I am incredibly empathetic and always joke around. But on the other hand, if any of my hobbies are positive if gives me absolute ICK. 

For example, my hobby is journaling. But if it's not dark, with traumacore pictures, dark Francis Bacon - like styled entries it doesn't bring me any joy. 

When I was a daycare worker, I was so influenced by this that I was even scared to change the kid's diapers because I was scared I'd be blamed for SA. That's how much these things influence me.

Sunlight_Shield,Maybe someone can give me som insight (?),1,1bgwvte,2,"
I hope I can post this here. 

Since I was a kid, my life has been weird. My parent divorced when I was a baby, I live with my mom and step dad (who abused me). My mom was really depressed, and I basically was her best friend, then we realized she had BPD and passed away 2 years ago. 

When i was a teenager I went to live with my dad and step mlm, I struggled with depression, suicide attempts and malnutrition (this one involuntary, I was living with my step mom, after my dad leave home, we where 5 kids and only one income, so there wasn't enough to eat) my mom thought I had anorexy cuz I was way below my weight. 

I can say that I got my myself together, I can maintain relationship and friendships, but after my mom died I've been struggling with self harm and suicide thoughts, I went to therapy, 3 times, but I never got a clear diagnosis, it could been BPD, or bipolarity, or whatever, I just couldn't keep paying it. 

This year I feel really fine, going to the gym, changing my diet, keeping my friends closer, but I know, I'm not 100% okay. I still feel this dread and fear for the future, I still got suicide tendencies, I struggle with over eating and I have anger issues (not violent, I just isolate myself at work and ask to be left alone) sometimes, I feel angry all the day, or I just jump from euphoria to grieving in a matter of hours. 

I used to be a caring person, of at least I tried, but this year I kinda gave up on people, I don't want to hear someone else problems or help, I used to do it, I used to enjoy helping people and listen to someone else problems, convince them to keep going and fighting for what they want, even if I had a gun on my head a few minutes ago (not literally) but right now, I just don't really care anymore.

TSJustine,I blocked my best friend of three years with BPD…,3,1bgoch5,4,"So my now ex best friend (F 20) and I (F 18) have been very close for around three years and she has bpd, as well as she has been in therapy and group homes from around 11-18. Although she’s been treated she still has a disorder and it is very clear she has a very long way to go. Today she texted me that she feels that I no longer want to be friends anymore and that she needs to take a step back. I understood that this was her bpd and although I was hurt I knew I should just be patient. Yet when she further said she did not want me to explain to her why I have been distant nor comment on what she had just said and simply discarded me, it broke me and made me feel extremely disrespected. The only reason I had been slightly distant was because I realized I was the one putting in all the effort, not only that but constantly walking on eggshells about every little aspect of our relationship. I cared so much and genuinely poured my heart and soul into it and tried so hard to understand what she was going through that it honestly broke me. Especially for the past two to three months I was the only one asking to make plans, for the past two months I was the only one texting first, and getting extremely cold and distant responses. So eventually I took a step back and wanted to see how much effort she would genuinely put into our relationship. Not much obviously. Around two weeks ago I also recently quit weed which was a massive component of our friendship as she was my plug. I thought that me quitting would be no issue, and although I had been slightly distant towards everyone in my life while in the first few days of quitting, I thought once I got over that hump that we would still have our relationship. I guess not. I knew I had been slightly distant but not even to the spec of how distant she was towards me. I had not done anything wrong, and I still deeply wanted to be her friend, but today when she blamed me, and basically discarded me it felt as if everything we every had was nothing to her. I put so much into that relationship just for her to throw me away. Not only that but to blame me for the very things she’s doing to herself, as with our friendship dynamic she could do no wrong. I did still want to be friends but I also wanted to see her effort, and instead all I got in return was me being in the “wrong”. I had always been so patient, sometimes putting her before me. I always tried my best, and tried to see her for more than her disorder, and when it showed I always wanted to work through it, she taught me so much with the years of her therapy, and had made a positive impact in my life, now thinking about she also made devastating impacts in my life. Her blaming me and discarding me was so utterly painful, made me feel so worthless and disrespected after a few hours of thought I blocked her on everything. I feel like I lost myself in our friendship. I feel like I’ve also lost so many things in my life because of the manipulation and catering to her disorder. I’m so devastated but also relived. I didn’t want it to end but I know and couldn’t expect her to change, and I needed to do it for myself, that truly was my final straw. I genuinely never thought it would’ve come to that until it did. I wish her the best and not having even a final conversation breaks me. Yet at the end of the day all she would have done was blame me and refuse to view her toxic behavior. ",1710647291.0,
yuh__ok,sex is good.. but it hurts so much.,7,1bgdxsw,13,"so I have been with my bf for 3 years now, and we have had a bit of an issue when it comes to intimacy. everytime we start to have sex, it takes about 5 minutes or so before it really starts to hurt me on the inside... my body almost anticipates it at times and will tense up out of anxiety but that makes it worse. ofc it ruins the mood bc when it hurts I try to hide it and 'suck it up' to just finish yk. he notices tho, then I feel terrible that we have to stop and I start crying. I don't remember the last time I've had sex without either it hurting so much or me getting so much anxiety during it that I start crying.. it saddens me bc I feel a big part of how we connect is through intimacy but it almost repulses me to think about sex most of the time bc I feel icky and gross..

Ok_Analysis9769,What treatment options are there when nothing I try seems to work?,1,1bgohkf,1,"**TL;DR** I've am autistic and have tried different medications and therapies and nothing has worked. I'm struggling a lot and don't know what to do or where to turn to. What options do I have? 

I've struggled with my mental health for most of my life. I'm turning 20 this year and it feels useless to continue trying to get better when nothing seems to be working. I am diagnosed with ASD and suspect a lot of my mental health struggles are due to the autism but I am also ""high-functioning"" (choosing to use that term because I don't find 'low support needs' to properly describe my situation) which means I don't have access to any care specific to my autism. I have learnt to cope with my struggles as I went undiagnosed up until I was around 15 years old (even though it was heavily suspected all throughout my childhood). I have been on multiple different medications (SSRIs, SNRI, mood stabiliser) with no effect. I am currently not taking any psych meds, most recently came off Venlafaxine since it only caused excessive sweating and did nothing for my mental health. 

I've done different therapies, DBT, CBT, ERGT, and just talking to someone once every week/two weeks. I'm about to end my current therapy contact and will just be on my own after that. We have two more sessions planned until I'm sent away into the dark on my own. I don't think I can handle that though and I don't know how to bring it up with my provider because ERGT didn't give me anything and I'm still doing just as bad (if not worse). I don't want to just do talk therapy again like I have for so many years because it doesn't give me anything but I can't manage all on my own. I need to get better but I don't know what I can try because it feels like I've done it all. 

I'm currently clean from self harm and my restrictive eating disorder is calm **but** I'm not well internally. I'm not showing it physically through these harmful behaviours which means they [the healthcare system] don't see a reason to treat me even if I'm miserable. They only treat the symptoms, not the problem. If I'm not actively hurting myself they won't do anything, so as long as I'm able to handle my impulses I'm ""cured"" to them. I can't live like this though, it's only a matter of time before I relapse or try to take my life again because I can't manage the urges and impulses. All my energy goes towards distracting myself which makes living life *extremely* hard. My school work is suffering and work exhausts me so much I'm unable to work multiple days in a row. Lately I've had a lot of close calls where I almost gave in and it's getting harder and harder to not give in each time. 

I'm at a point where I'm seriously considering self medicating because I feel so hopeless and out of options. I don't want to go that route though, it can jeopardise my career and relationships. 

I also really give everything a fair chance, I don't just give up on stuff because it doesn't show results right away. I have taken each medication I've tried for at least 6 months (most of them multiple years) before giving up on it. For therapy I always put in the work and follow through with the whole program. I only stopped DBT early and it was because it made me so suicidal to do group sessions. Even when I feel like giving up I remind myself to give it an honest try and push through trying to be positive. So it's not like I'm not seeing progress because I'm not fully giving everything a chance. 

I also want to add that I am limited in what support I am able to access as I'm in a country with 'universal healthcare' and I don't have private healthcare insurance. But if there is some form of treatment that is highly likely to actually work I would be willing to put money towards it but I'm unable to try a bunch of maybes out with a private provider.

I’m extremely fearful that I will take my life if I do fail and it's like there’s a voice in the back of my head saying that I will. Whenever I feel about suicide my stomach drops and I feel internally sick, but I’m scared that it will turn into something twisted such as a relief. My father died of suicide and I was there so I know that makes me more predisposed to suicidal ideation plus more history of health issues/depression. I want to have meaningful relationships with people, know how to act in social situations, not perform shameful compulsions, and learn to not feel guilty/down all the time. I feel that I’m my own worst enemy and I can’t do this anymore so something has to change. My idea life is to be caring, compassionate, social, warm/welcoming, easy to talk to or listen to, hard worker, educated and seeking a further understanding of the world, no longer have these OCD thoughts, have a girlfriend and eventually a wife, get past my religious OCD that has pushed me away from God. I am currently alive because I love my family and I saw what my dad’s suicide did to them. I am not alive at the moment for my current ambitions or future purpose. I want to be alive for my future and have ambitions that I have the desire to fight for. I want to thrive in my life and not just hold onto it by a thread for the sake of my loved ones. I’m tired of seeing all the people in my life pass me in success when I’m barely holding on. I want to rise with them and live the life that God meant for me. I don’t know what that life is, but I believe that I am not currently there. After analyzing my OCD for a long time I have noticed the following: Talking to people about my problems makes me ruminate and I have the compulsion of doing it over and over, I have some form of religious OCD that I feel terrible whenever I go to church or am at christian groups even though there is no reason for the emotions, I masturbate out of compulsion even though I’m not aroused and watch pornography which in turn makes me feel disgusted at myself (lasts several days with these thoughts making me not wanting to go to church even more). I feel that I can’t have a social life and go to school at the same time and have the compulsion to isolate and study. I end up procrastinating and playing video games, watching pornography, and studying. I know that I have the time to socialize and study and I’d feel so much better, but I feel that I’m incapable of having a relationship outside of a classroom. I feel that I wasn’t made correctly and I guess thats where the suicidal thoughts start to come in. “Maybe if I was dead it would spare the world of one more screwed up person.” I feel like I’m screwed up. I’ve had health problems my whole life, I haven’t had a meaningful relationship in close to 15 years, and I feel that people reach out to me not out of friendliness but out of pity due to my extreme shyness. I hate my current self with every bit of my inner being and want to become something more. I’m pursuing school to become someone who will heal those who are suffering and I want to use that WHY as my way to push through my feelings. I feel that I’m a loser, have nothing going for my life, and have nothing to show for it. I don’t know how I am going to push through and that’s why I am asking you to help me  get the help that I desperately need. I am currently on Desvenlafaxine 50 mg, but I feel that it isn’t helping at all. I am scared to try something new due to the potential side effects causing my school performance to potentially worsen. I don’t want to medically withdraw, and I’m scared of sharing this with my advisor. I feel like I’m always serious and I mentally/physically and incapable of having fun in a situation whether it be a current trend or just in the moment. There are times when things are okay but a majority of the time they aren’t.  ",1710645335.0,

It took a while before we caught on that the problem is only in her mind but she's obviously very convinced of her delusion. She claims things like undeniable intuition that she's right, but when reality doesn't match she doesn't question herself. It's come to a point where she believes her mold problem is persistent (for weeks now) and she's ready to propose mold-related issues as an explanation for just about anything you could think of. She is also claiming further medical problems on top of that (most recently a parasite and its ""eggs come out when she sweats"").  
She may as well be burning her money at this point with the way she's been visiting urgent care and various doctors, when they tell her the tests don't match her belief and she is likely having a neurological problem then it's ""I'm being discriminated against"" because she feels dismissed, or like they've ""decided that I'm crazy so they won't look for the deeper physical problem anymore.""  
She doesn't listen to doctors or reason so how can we get her to accept psychiatric help? What's worse is that she has (somewhat recently) moved to a different state to be near to her family (they are unfortunately unreliable) and I think there's no one physically close who can be expected to help her.

&#x200B;

***There will be several more or less ethereal topics discussed.***  

&#x200B;

\~-Consider yourself thinking every/a few days about some moment of introversion about a possible 

life after death and therefore guiding these steps, your rhythm of life in relation to this thing by paying 

attention to it (I know how to turn off my brain don't worry aha) is something abnormal/widespread 

among us others who have never needed a revelation from a source other than their thoughts (in my

 case I did it very early but I I can't say when but I remember very early on but I will take a very simple 

example that just by killing a poor insect I instantly ask myself the question: is it in another ""world"" 

now.)

&#x200B;

  \~- By that I mean imagining another dystopian utopian world (I don't know the definition like the 

back of my hand but these terms are part of the subject hey hey) even if the same resonances come

 and come back over and over again, at least the most "" basic"" and sometimes I like to delve my nose

 into books to ""find myself"" there. I don't know about you, but thinking that creation has no limits 

remains magical.  

&#x200B;

\~-Or is there for some of you who are what we call more down to earth less dreamy a 

sort of automatism in the way of living and a feeling of well-being from having an empty head all the

 time/often of all notice. 

\~- I say that because I went through the 2 states above ""according to different 

periods of my life"" and during certain days and I am now 29 years old. 

&#x200B;

And I approach another subject, I no longer really have the impression of moving forward, it's like the 

time passing was stopping and to make it start again I had to accomplish certain objectives which for one is training receptionist because I really want to work in welcoming people and maintaining a 

place. I have always been very smiling and outgoing and have no fear of putting myself forward 

(except perhaps with women haha) that's how I needed the presence of someone who I could love and

 she also in return a woman in this case who could help me put elbow grease into what I want to do 

and help her also in return because I of my own free will preferred to remain solitary .

  I hope that I will have answers that will make me think or examples of life and even funny answers \^\^' ",1710617860.0,

Instead, I was compelled.

The wounds that won't mend.

I never doubted anyone else didn't know something, but they all seem to doubt I know anything. I wonder how much of this is actually a shift in how society is treating one another - are more people just on power trips?

The problem is worsened by the fact that I can't 'correct' anyone back. I have tried. But the other person has some explanation that basically puts me in my place and shuts me up, so that I have nothing to say in return. This happens all the time at my job, and yet I'm told I'm doing a great job - it's hard for me to believe since everything I say is either shut down or corrected. I'm supposed to be making decisions, but when I do they are always shut down and the opposite is done. Why do they like me then?

The issue is my next appointment is on April 9th so it’s very far away. I did talk to my psychiatrist but it’s apparent I need a therapist here. So, I was wondering if anyone had ideas on how to ride this out till my appointment.

I’ll probably explain what I’m experiencing so it’ll be easier to suggest things. I’ve been feeling like there’s someone in my head communicating with me. It’s not an auditory hallucination because I don’t actually hear it. How it communicates is through thoughts that feel alien and emotions that don’t feel like my own. I know this is all ridiculous so I’m pretty sure it isn’t a delusion either. And I don’t believe there’s a real person in my head either.

I’ll also feel the presence of another person and start having conflicting beliefs at times. The worst part have been when I get told things that are accompanied by an intense emotion that lasts for minutes to hours. For example, I absolutely hated my name and hearing it whenever people said it for a certain amount of time yesterday. It’s gone now. And also, my memory seems to have gotten way worse in recent times. I can hardly remember anything anymore.

I will say I’ve had the feeling of a presence in the past and I’ve always had worse than usual memory but the communicating thing is new.

So, I’m looking for ways to cope with this till my appointment because I feel like I’m either going crazy, imagining stuff, or faking it. Thanks for any suggestions.",1710525388.0,

I have to have conversations with it to almost try to calm it down but it doesn’t help so I end up just letting the words fly. For example I will ask it, “I am…?” And it will immediately say “stupid, ugly, a loser.” Then I will say in my head “no, I’m pretty.” And it goes “pretty ugly.” It’s like a bully in my head. I don’t believe what it says and it’s like a narration of my every moment. Sometimes it will go away in the evening and sometimes what it says doesn’t seem as loud in my head. It’s like constantly on alert and going to the negative or worst case scenario. I was talking to my sister the other day and it goes,” hang up, hang up, hang up.

Hour_Ad_6241,I suffer depression and its possibly bipolar depression ,2,1bf6jr4,1,"I was diagnosed with an “unspecified mood disorder” a little over a year and a half ago. I was put on antidepressants and antipsychotics which seemed to help at the time. But my life has gone down hill ever since then. I lost my cousin to suicide in December, then i lost my grandpa in January. Ive been in my first relationship since september, Hes my first real love. I wont go into too much detail. But i wouldnt ask for anyone else. 

If im being 100 real, if i wasnt in this relationship, i probably would have ended it a while ago, Im struggling as it is and i cant really talk to anyone about it. I cant go into detail about it with my boyfriend because he deals with enough as it is, or enough of me aswell and im not only one. Im a bit selfish to be real, but im working on myself. But its extremely hard to control myself, extremely hard to not be depressed. Heres the thing: Ive always been depressed. Always wanted to off myself, Probably started when i was 13. I self harm, still do, not as much tho. I also self medicate, weed, since i was 14, so my memory is pretty bad. Fuck it i still do it though. Thats kind of what im getting at here. Yesterday my boyfriend was upset and said i had no real reason to be depressed. Well i didnt believe him because of what im going through right now, im sure he knows this part and was probably just mad. But it really made me think, i was 14 crying in my room sobbing wanting to kill myself. 
All ive done today was sit and bed and try and remember *why*. But its been an entire day of sitting here, doing nothing , And, i still havent come up with a real reason i wanted to kill myself when i was 13. I look at my boyfriend and the experiences hes told me he went through, which take alot of courage i know it does, all the horrible things he went through, self medicating he did, and hes still here somehow working his ass off sober everyday while taking care of me. I do worry about him. Hes incredibly strong, i try telling him almost everyday. I dont know how he does it. Were both struggling.

 But now i feel so selfish. Its like most my life i was never given any real reason to be *this* depressed, but i always have been and it hasnt changed. people have had it so much more worse than me and they cope with their pain so well.  Given my life now, its only got worse. Ive done an extreme amount of self reflecting due to suicidal tendancies lately, and i feel blinded to who ive been my entire life. Im a shitty person. I take it out on others. I rely on others. im not saying any of this for attention or for people to feel bad for me, i have been a shit person a majority of my life. Yeah i was a sweet kid growing up but something went wrong in my brain and i now lack the ability to change these tendancies i have. 

I will end up deleting this but in the slight chance theres someone out there who feels somewhat similar, i hope you know you arent the only one. cuz i feel like i am. And im dronwning.  my life has been a lie lol and either way im going to be depressed about it, but now i can just feel selfish and unworthy to feeel sooo much pain. ",1710480312.0,

For example she would think me and my brother were 'looking through drawers and stealing money"" to ""buy drugs"" (no idea where this came from, we were just school children and then sent on to university, I remember her mum said things like this too but as she was older I put it down to dementia.

Another time when I was seriously ill she said it was 'because I was taking drugs"" it was an emergency life saving surgery for a benign tumour and nothing caused it, just bad luck. She said my uncle's cancer was because 'he was playing too much golf"" and when my son had pneumonia and was very ill as a toddler 'we should remove his oxygen tube as he didn't need it"". Quite worrying.

Both mum and dad have had obsessions with, for example the place they worked for, they would go on and on about it, they did live at the workplace but still it was a bit OTT. Going to visit it after they had left etc.

My brother and I have had to keep things secret for example workplaces as she would call them and ask them things about us. Mum also thinks things like for example she would see someone on a train and say, oh it must have been so and so, when it was very unlikely. Bit strange. 

has anyone else had something like this? I have gone No contact with mum after the drugs accusations when recovering from surgery, she has not taken it back or apologised.

I joined this sub a few days ago and I wanted to round up all of the resources that helped me and share them here so that some of y’all might benefit. In addition to the below, I did take medication (and still do) and did some therapy and found they definitely played a role in my journey.

Books:

1. The Mindful Way through Depression by Mark Williams
2. You are not a Rock by Mark Freeman
3. Mindfulness for Beginners by Jon Kabat Zinn
4. At Last a Life by Paul David - Paul’s website anxietynomore dot com also has tons of free resources and blog posts that cover everything from anxiety to derealisation to intrusive thoughts 

Meditation:

Maybe you’ve tried meditation before and thought it didn’t work for you because you got distracted. That’s ok, you’re supposed to get distracted as we have busy minds. Try to commit to 10 mins of meditation per day to begin with, thereu are 100’s of guided meditations on YouTube. Jon Kabat-Zinn is my favourite but try a few and see what works for you. Meditation is a practise that over time, brings peace to our mind. It doesn’t happen right away :)

Everything else:

1. Getting outside every day, even for 10 minutes. I live in Ireland and the weather is unpredictable at best but even if it’s raining, getting outside for 10 mins of fresh air helped me
2. Kristin Neff’s work on Self Compassion - you can find all of her stuff on YouTube, she has a great TedTalk called ‘the difference between self compassion and self esteem’ that is very interesting. You can also find some self compassion exercises on her website. Changing how we speak to ourselves is HUGE in recovery from depression 
3. Routine self care - even a basic routine each day where I drank a certain amount of water, took my vitamins and watched a show I liked helped me from a self care perspective. I know most people don’t have the luxury of childcare or help outside the home so these are basic things that helped me invest in my health. You can do whatever works for you, maybe it’s a skincare routine but doing it every day is a kindness that you deserve
4. Time. As hard as it is to hear when you’re in the thick of it, time passing played a role in healing me from PPD. How long it will take will depend on you personally but it won’t last forever.

Mental illness is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to go through so if you’re in the thick of it, I’m sending you so much love. I hope this helps someone!",1710383491.0,

jquelin___,My mental health ,2,1be2hhi,1,"Well life has been weird for me, back in late October I recently discovered I liked girls, I've had feelings for girls before but I had a crush on one of my friends and it just confirmed what I've felt. It was a huge change for me and my mental health started declining. It took me a lot of energy to head to classes and my job and it got worse after I got laid off. 
Not only that but it felt like some of my friends didn't care which isn't true but i felt so lonely. I haven't come out to my parents yet only my younger sister a cousin and close friends. And then I began having suicidal thoughts again and had actually thought out a plan, the date and place. I just cried a lot and now I feel nothing, lately it's been harder to feel anything and I just feel tired and more like ""fuck it we ball"" whenever it comes to serious situations. 
I also feel like I need to isolate myself from others and have been skipping classes since the beginning of the semester minus one class since attendance is required. I don't feel like doing anything plus it feels like everytime I feel like showing emotion it feels fake. I've also been dissociating a lot and zoning out I'm still financially dependent on my parents and when I've asked them if I could use antidepressants or schedule myself a therapy session they declined and my mother said ""just focus on God"". 
I'm tired of her always involving religion into serious conversations as my younger sister went through a similar experience though she had therapy while I still haven't. I've been doing my best though to keep myself sane but I'm just so burnout, I wanna leave my home but even my own mom doubts me and I doubt myself. She gets mad that I don't look at her or engage in conversations with her anymore but I'm TIRED, and I just wish I could have a conversation with her without her bringing up religion I'm not comfortable anymore and legit (still cry) during mass because I feel like an imposter. My trichotillomania got worse and I think I have an eating disorder, I don't feel the need to eat anymore.",1710363189.0,
Difficult_Cherry_616,i think i have a mental illness but i can’t tell,1,1be7ghx,4,"before i start this, i just wanna say this kinda includes self harm and talks of suicidal thoughts, also that i struggle with anxiety and depression
im not sure if this is the right place to post this but if it’s not please tell me, so for almost three years now i’ve been struggling with sounds. i hate sounds in general and i am usually always wearing my airpods. around two years ago in august i became aware that i hated the sound of people eating. then that expanded to gum chewing, people eating ice and other mouth related sounds. around last year even more sounds became triggers for me, breathing, foot tapping, whispering and people tapping on things. i didn’t think much of it till violent thoughts came along with it. whenever i would hear these sounds, my first reaction in my brain was, to smash the person head into the desk or a nearby wall. i would also have violent thoughts about hurting myself or smashing my head into the desk. then touch became an issue. i can’t handle things like hoodies or sweater rubbing against paper, i hate paper, being able to feel dirt on my hands, styrofoam, the feeling of cardboard, the sound of cardboard being rubbing together, so on and so forth. the main way i stop myself from hurting others, is by hurting myself. if i’m in class and someone is breathing heavy, my fight or flight kicks in and i start scratching at my arms and legs as well as digging my fingernails into my skin. ive done this so often and so badly that i’ve started to see scars on my arms from my nails. this usually doesn’t work that well and i’ll still be bothered by it. i’m mostly worried about the violent thoughts and the way i handle them. another thing that doesn’t really have to do with the sound and touch but i thought might be important is that i feel little to no empathy or sympathy for others. for example my friend could be talking about something that happened to them that was traumatic and i can’t feel anything. i don’t feel bad for them and i can’t understand why. i’m able to put a brace face on and pretend i care, but deep down i don’t. i have feeling and emotions but i can’t feel them for other people. just this week i said something that made my friend upset and she told me about it, while she was talking i didn’t feel anything, i didn’t feel bad for her at all which makes me feel bad because then i feel insane. for the past year and a half i’ve convinced myself i’m insane and need to be put away in a hospital.

The message of this post is that the Internet is much too vast for the current human Brain, and if this information continues to spread in the future people will be getting sad and eventually reach their demise. (this is includes the growing amount of explicit content on the internet) 

I am pretty sure that this vast information we have access to is the underline cause of a lot of mental health issues in the general public today.

,"Phrase ""we are not our thoughts"" caused me slight dissociation - asking for HELP?",1,1bdocd2,0,"I have been reading about this concept, and it has only caused me pain. So if if I think about how much I like certain song then it's a lie? Things I enjoy immensely always find a way to transfer from my emotions to my thoughts, and I always found it helpful towards the journey of self discovery. We have so many complex systems that work as one whole now tell me how does that not shape or personality and who we are.. So every single thing that my thoughts tell me I enjoy, is a lie? Every observation I have in the outside world where: I meet a random person and I like them and I think to myself that I really do like them, then everything I think to myself in any kind of a situation is false, and it has nothing to do with me? Even the way we write, what we write about has traces of our personality - and it comes from our thoughts.. I find it impossible to believe that our thoughts are not connected to our personality in any way. In a lot of ways they guide us towards her interests, our Hobbies, our relationships, so how can none of it be apart of who we are? Can someone tell me that some of our some of our thoughts are apart of our personality, because now I feel my interests are meaningless my relationships are meaningless my taste in anything I like is meaningless because anything my thoughts tell me I like is apparently false and and tells us nothing about ourselves... I'll give you an example I see something I like, then I have a thought that the thing I see looks amazing, and then that same thought produces an emotion that makes me feel good, and at the same time I discover what I like. So tell me how how the thoughts we have are not stepping stones towards ourselves.

**I see a point in not identifying with our bad or intrusive thoughts, as a part of self-help when your in therapy... But we shouldn't discredit all our thoughts as a part of ourselves, they play an important part in forming our identity, just as our feelings and behavior. They are all interconnected**.

**Why the phrase lacks logic**:

○ Before your discovered your interests and hobbies, you had an emotional feeling about a particular thing then thought to yourself ""I really like this, I want to do it again"", the emotion got translated into your thought - some parts of your thoughts helped you find your likes/dislikes and are as such - a part of you.

○ Before you do most of the things in everyday life - whether make a new friend, call your current friend, make food that YOU find tasty, what do you do? You think about how good it tasted in the past and that you want to make it again. Your thoughts were again apart of YOU and what YOU like.

○ When you search for a new job, and you want to find something that's aligned with your own desires and wishes, what do you do? You THINK about it and based on the THOUGHTS, and the ones you'll listen to (the ones you follow: and are again apart of YOU and your personality) will play a huge role in your life direction.

○ Through a psychological test where students wrote random thoughts on a piece of paper, psychologists acquired **many traces of their personality -** just based off that, and it was mostly accurate.

○ **We are not all of our thoughts but many of our thoughts tell us about who who we actually are**/they help us discover about or wants/preferences, about what we don't want and so much.

○ Where we currently are in life is a place where we travelled to based on the thoughts we chose to work with.

○ **Personality is a pattern of thought, feeling, and behavior, but little attention has been paid to thoughts** \- John A. Johnson, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University.

○ A new person we like and speak to regularly makes us feel a certain type of way - then **that emotion gets transferred to our thoughts**: ""I want to go out with this person, they make me feel good about myself, I like how many simillar things we share"" - based on our thinking we pursue that interest.

I just think that quote is false (**has some truth in when it comes to self-help or bad thoughts but is not entirely right**, - at the same time it causes me agony), and that thoughts, emotions and genetics are one of many parts that make us who we are. We have thoughts about our interests, likes, our love lives, if we didn't follow up with any of our thoughts we wouldn't develop any of the things i just mentioned.

**My opinion is (also based on research is) that some of our thoughts tell us nothing of ourselves and are indeed intrusive, and cause nothing but harm. But a lot of them are connected to our emotions, our personality/personal tastes, our inner drives and play an equal role as many other things (emotions, genetics, family cirmustances, etc.) that play a role and give shape to what we are.**

**Quotes from different internet sources**: ""Personalities contain the patterns of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that make each person unique. Together, these aspects can play a role in every part of our lives, from friendships to careers, to hobbies"". ""Thoughts: The Neglected Aspect of Personality: Personality is a pattern of thought, feeling, and behavior, but little attention has been paid to thoughts. The point is that all three aspects of what textbook author David Funder (2019) called the psychological triad—thoughts, feelings, and behavior—are equally important. - John A. Johnson, Ph.D, professor of psychology"". ""Thoughts are ideas, perspectives, opinions, and beliefs that influence our emotions, actions, and habits. They can be positive or negative, and they play a significant role in shaping our personality.""

**I am talking about this subject from a psychological/scientific point of view, not from any kind of spiritual/philosophical way of thinking**.

Are some of our thoughts part of our personality, our genetic makeup and our nature? Do they play a role in shaping personality? Do they tell us something about our values, beliefs, and bottom line: ourselves? I feel like thoughts/thought patterns, emotions, genetics, etc... All play equal role in shaping who we are (our personality).

Little_Plantain_9102,I don’t know what to do,1,1bdmxd1,4,"Hey hi ive been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. I got an evaluation done last year that stated an adhd diagnosis but was provisional, as it could just be my depression and anxiety.

Anyway im fucking scared. Let me summarize, i was starting my sophomore year of college last august. Two months later i was sent to the crisis center twice cuz i had a plan to kill myself. I was struggling in school, i was so numb i did not care about consequences anymore and i didnt know how to deal with that. I could always count on the adrenaline or me caring about a good grade to get me to do my work, but nothing. Nothing. What the fuck. The only thing i could do “functionally” i couldnt do either. School was something i could do, but only while neglecting my needs so yeah thats fucked. Anyway

I was taking zoloft and abilify, then my psych switched me to Effexor cuz of that drug test or whatever and trusts that more than my word. That shit fucked me up, then i tapered off of it and was unmedicated during this whole fiasco. I tried prozac but got hives and was unmedicated again. I found a new psych and now im on Wellbutrin but i literally.. there is no difference even after upping this med. i told him that i had taken that genesight test (and about the psych) but he too is basing decisions around this fuck ass test. 

What should i do, fuck should i try another med? I need to make sure i can function, i cannot mess this up again in the fall. Should i just go back on zoloft and abilify even if that didnt work very well either?

Ive tried so many meds already, i dont knkw what to do i feel stupid, i feel like these psychiatrists think im stupid or im lying i feel so stupid

TLDR; Wellbutrin isnt doing anything even after upping it, should i go back to other med or try a new one? What is some advice when u think a med is just not working?

unit1080,Does anyone have a similar experience?,3,1bdg6c1,1,"My life is a mess right now. I have no friends, have struggled to hold onto jobs, and am in a constant state of agitation, anxiety, and hopelessness. If I were to describe myself I’d say I have no true personality and am “weird”. And by weird I mean behaviors/thoughts that are unusual. There’s a couple I could go into but a big one is whenever I’m walking towards someone I look at them intensely. I do this subconsciously (and I know this because I sort of zone out then I realize I was just doing that and internally panic). I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember. 

Another one would be getting anxious whenever my eyes move like when I’m reading from my laptop or from a TV screen or anything else like a sign. (This is a major one for me).

I first saw a therapist when I was in high school and I was diagnosed with social anxiety. Then, I stopped going after I told her about an experience I had and she sort of put me off (but looking back it was me who wasn’t willing to put the work into working that out. 

I went on with my life but still with the belief that there’s something wrong with me. I ended up attempting suicide senior year of Highschool because I was tired of trying to figure out what was wrong with me. 

After that I got sent to a psych ward and was referred to mental health services. I resumed them and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I once again felt like it wasn’t working (not addressing the root cause) and left services once again. 

I went on with my life and got a job but I still had the same behaviors and thoughts and tried to commit suicide by drinking brake fluid. This time at the psych ward I was diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features. I personally did not believe in this diagnosis. I was once again referred to mental health services and I went but I still felt like it wasn’t working. So I left once again.

If I had to say what led me to my current state it would be whenever I realized that people would get uncomfortable whenever I would move my eyes to read whether it be on a paper, the whiteboard, or on a computer (at school). 

I’ve made an appointment with a social worker to refer me to a psychiatrist and therapist. I’ve honestly given up on life and on myself. My game plan is to be honest and request to be sent to a neuropsychiatrist for an evaluation

I saved my dad from my mom trying to kill him during a large fight after my dad physically attacked me. Shortly after my dad got psychosis for 3 months. Around this time I found peace after remembering parts of an NDE i had. it was like a gift. This peace slowly left over the last 2.5 years. My dad started using meth. I got into an abusive relationship where I was beaten and emotionally abused (lasted for 2 years). It ended Shortly after my dad hung himself and was revived (by this point i felt nothing). I lost my job after that. Then my dog died (one tear hit the floor over my dog my dad was there to remind me I don't have reason to cry) I've been out of work for 6 months and I don't really care. Spending most of the time being my dad's shoulder to cry on. Hearing how much pain he's in just about every day any hope i offer him gets shit on. I feel empty aside from constant thoughts of not being myself or feeling like everything about me is fake or lost. I don't want to die because of that near death experience a few years back (was a beautiful experience). But I can't stand myself any thought or feeling is torment. Afew months back i was beating myself daily as a punishment for my lack of caring. I don't fantasize about killing myself as I believe death would only bring a strange regret and sadness. But I do fantasize about breaking limbs as i imagine the pain would feel like enough. I've cried 3 times in this last year each time it feels fake.

AnonymousNarwhal32,Narcissist trying to figure himself out - looking for support (TW),3,1bd49cg,2,"Hey everyone,  
  
I (22M) want to describe a bunch of things related to my personality and actions because it's really clear at this point that I need to figure stuff out. Many people have suggested/told me that I give full-stop narcissist vibes. So I'm going to lay that out and explain a bit further, as well as some things about my background that might help. If anyone here has been abused by a narc before, I'm truly sorry, and I've read about experiences with this kind of abuse and how traumatizing it can be. If you'd like to go off on me, you are more than welcome to do so. But please know that I am not making excuses for my behavioral habits, only looking for support.  
  
Moving on to my background, I've never really had many friends, if any at all. For most of my life, I didn't have friends. I was homeschooled and never did a lot of interacting with people outside my immediate family. In fact, a lot of my extended family seemed to despise/dislike me for some reason, even telling me to get out or leave the room when they visited. However, I do have a history of mental illness in my family; one of my grandfathers has been violent towards his wife, has plotted to harm another relative, and has been predatory towards women on multiple occasions.  
  
I was told that I was an extremely difficult child and hated being told what to do, and would often do the very opposite of what I was told. My parents speak about having to use physical punishment to get me to do what I was told, including when I refused to write letters and numbers in the proper way. Apparently, when I was younger, a doctor suggested that I was oppositional-defiant and advised my parents to physically punish me. Which they did, using a belt and a spatula.  
  
I grew up hating physical contact, such as being hugged and kissed. It always made me uncomfortable and I wanted no part of it. I also developed some rather severe OCD rituals as a kid, such as believing I could get sick and die after touching family pets and refusing to touch light switches, among other things, as well as believing that God would kill me if I did not do certain things (I was raised Christian). I still have OCD now, but it's manifested into something different, such as believing myself to be abusive to literally everyone around me, and needing to check my memory among other things to prove to myself that these thoughts are false, but it being near impossible to do so.  
  
I started going to college at a fairly young age (in my early teens), so this was my first experience with in-person education. I had been doing algebra at a very young age, so I was considered very intelligent as a child. I never really made friends, because all my classmates were older than me, but often found myself craving those kinds of connections and being frustrated that they seemed unachievable to me.  
  
I compensated for the loneliness by going online and joining various online communities to try to make friends. In group chats, I always needed to be the center of attention, whether I consciously realized it or not, and I was telling people only the most ""impressive"" things about myself to try to make people like me. On numerous occasions, I was called out for being narcissistic, manipulative, and even sociopathic on multiple occasions. I found that I never really belonged in any of these situations and I always felt inherently different than everyone else. There was a part of me that wanted exclusive friendships but always felt a sense of inadequacy that everyone was more interesting than me and that I would never be an interesting person that other people wanted to be friends with. So I acted out on numerous occasions, talking about people behind their backs, making people feel badly for having other friends, and even creating fake personas to tell people about the intrusive thoughts that I had where I believed that I was abusive to everyone. I know that this affected people emotionally on multiple occasions, and while I can feel some guilt for it, I've never really been able to feel the level of guilt/remorse that other people can.  
  
My behavior wasn't just self-destructive to other people, but also for myself, because I was willing to settle for negative attention if I couldn't get positive attention. This led to some very bad situations where I deliberately put myself in situations to get death threats from other people. Some people took it upon themselves to try to trigger me into ending my life. There was something about it that felt cathartic to have other people trying to destroy me. I did a similar thing again recently, and I'm still under the full belief that I deserve to be destroyed in every possible way.  
  
Regarding my empathy, I've never really been an empath. It's not that I can't feel any empathy whatsoever, but it's just extremely repressed and I can never truly understand why other people feel the way that they do. I can only really understand myself, but I still can't even fully understand why I do the things I do. I can't really read when other people are doing poorly on an emotional level, and sometimes I have unknowingly contributed to making it worse through some of the behavioral patterns that I mentioned. However, it was never deliberate attempts; I never liked the idea of affecting other people or sought to do it, but it happened as a result of my actions sometimes. But instead of taking accountability when I did these things, I would often lash out and deflect the blame to cope with my feelings of shame. I could never make myself rationalize the idea of myself being problematic, which made things worse as I failed to accept responsibility.  
  
As I mentioned, my feelings of guilt and remorse are also repressed, but I can and do feel them at times, especially when I'm on my own and I'm thinking things over. I don't completely lack empathy though; I can feel it on occasion, especially with animals. I see animals as being truly innocent and good, and I have always had a deep connection with them because my family has always had pets. I work as a volunteer to help animals, and they are one of my greatest passions.  
  
As a grad student, I've found myself orbiting social circles a bit more than I ever did as an undergrad. However, ""orbiting"" is the key word. I've never felt truly accepted by any social groups, and when I am invited to social events, it doesn't feel that I belong like others do. It always feels like someone likes someone else much more than they like me, and that I'm the ""last resort"" friend that others do not want to get close with. Nonetheless, when anyone needs homework help, that's when I usually end up getting texts from others. I've found in-person social interaction to be extremely difficult now that I've been practicing it more, and I often feel extremely inadequate and insecure. I've been staying away from social groups because I get the sense that my narcissistic/manipulative habits are coming out and affecting other people and because it makes more sense to be on my own than to ""force"" myself into friendships that I may be unwelcome in.  
  
From what I've seen, people aren't usually willing to tell you when they're uncomfortable with things that you're doing, at least not to your face. But I've been described on multiple occasions as being like an ""estranged outsider."" To cope with my own feelings of shame, lack of self-confidence, and self-hatred, I've developed a sort of cocky and sarcastic personality to pretend like I'm a confident and well-adjusted person, but it's been made very clear on numerous occasions that I'm the opposite. I'm not the kind of narcissist that believes that I should ""rule the world,"" I'm the kind that deals with extreme self-hate that is very easy to activate. I have on numerous occasions let things slip that were insensitive or insulting to others without the intention to hurt. Like I mentioned, it ""happens.""  
  
I tend to crave friendship and I ""resent"" other people at times for the fact that I do not feel included or welcomed. It leads to a lot of frustration with others. I like to believe that I could be a loving person if I was given the opportunity to be, but I'm a cold person because of these feelings of frustration and jealousy. I'm jealous and envious that others have these close friendships and that it seems like I cannot have them. But I've been conscious of that jealousy.  
  
I've also found that I cannot attach to many people in general. It is very hard for me to attach to someone, but I generally find myself attaching to people who ""reinforce"" me, make me feel that I'm unique, and with whom my friendship is more ""exclusive."" I've always liked the idea of exclusive friendships where it's me and someone else against the world. I have one person that I would call a friend in grad school. I have all my problems that I've described, and she is an introvert that believes our classmates are immature, so we've bonded in a way, as well as based on the fact that we've regularly had many of the same classes in every semester.  
  
I often find myself getting jealous of her other friends in our classes out of fear and anxiety that she will eventually have no place for me in her life because of them, but I suppress these feelings because I don't want her to be hurt. I want to be the closest friend she has in our classes, and I honestly really value what she thinks of me. We've been talking about hanging outside class a lot lately, and I've been inviting her to different things. I'm hoping that she'll always be in my life. She has opened up to me about many things she is going through that she has told me that she has not even told her own family, so I want to feel like I deserve that level of trust. I'm doing my best to try to help her, but it doesn't feel like it's enough because of who I am. So I keep trying to seek friends in various online communities related to my hobbies because I'm trying to find something where I feel secure long-term, but it doesn't feel like anything is working.  
  
I genuinely wish I was a healthy person to be friends with, but I'm not and I probably never will be. At the end of the day, as a narcissist, I feel like I'll always be a ""predatory"" friend because something will always be about me. Sometimes I think about how others have healthy friendships and are well-adjusted, and then I internalize that I'm not, and that I have problems that can and do affect other people. Since I'm on the younger side, I'd like to start doing something to keep it in check before it gets stuck with me when I'm older.  
  
Sorry about all of that spam. With that being said, are there any advice or suggestions y'all would be able to give me?

throwaway2078222803,CAMH - My Experience in a Mental Hospital,3,1bcjaak,2,"I'm 21M and I live in Toronto. I've been to CAMH (an incredible hospital for mental health and addiction) four times, three last year and once this year. 

I read a lot of horror stories on here and comments about people discouraging others from going to hospitals when in crisis, and I in no way mean to discredit anyone's experiences, but I thought it might be helpful for someone who's thinking of going and lives in Ontario or even Canada. 

Not to get too much into my personal life, but I was sexually and physically abused as a child by my father growing up, and just stated to come to terms with it last year. This sent me into a depressive episode full of suicidal ideation and self-harm, leading to my therapist calling emergency services on me and then bringing me to CAMH. 

What to expect:
If you're brought by emergency services, they'll have to wait with you until a nurse can bring you into the main waiting room, if you admit yourself, you talk to the front desk at emerg, sit for a bit, get brought into a small room and basically get interviewed on why you're here, if they think it warrants being in the actual emergency room, they'll let you go through. Once you're in the actual emergency waiting room, it's a waiting game. A nurse will talk to you within a few hours and ask you more questions about why you're here, a doctor will then do the same. The doctor is the one that determines whether or not you get admitted to inpatient.

This process has taken me from 6-26 hours. It all depends on if they have any beds available. They bring you a cot to sleep on in the waiting room if you choose to stay and wait for a bed to open up. 

Some people have stayed in emerg for a few days, but from my experience, if you need somewhere safe to stay, they'll find you a bed. If you don't feel safe being anywhere outside of hospital and you communicate that, from my experience, you can stay in the waiting room for a long time. They also give you the option of leaving and coming back the next day when beds might be free in inpatient. 

I've only been admitted to the CCC6 floor and the CYU floor. Both were incredible, full of nurses and support workers that are working so hard to make sure you feel safe in hospital. Meals are three times a day and snack twice a day. There's groups throughout the weekdays and the weekends are fairly boring. You'll see a doctor most days who will check on your progress, adjust medication, and assist with diagnosis. There's also social workers, nutritionists, and pharmacists, who will all help you get the care you need. 

Some people are there for a couple days and others a couple months. They won't push you to leave if you don't feel safe to. Once you do leave, your doctor will go over any plans you made with them or the other staff, my doctor set me up with a psychologist who I see once a month. They can also help with finding a job/EI or a place to live. 

Overall, it's a place that I feel safe to go when I'm in crisis, and I strongly encourage you to do the same. I've heard stories from other patients about other hospitals where the treatment was less kind and warm, and they weren't allowed many or any of their possessions. CAMH is purely a mental health and additions hospital, and everyone there is trained to help you with whatever has brought you there. 

If you have any other questions feel free to DM me : ) ",1710202974.0,
AdEuphoric4698,Why do I (28f) have a mental breakdown while moving? ,1,1bcpqfs,1,"Every time I (28f) move I have a complete meltdown whenever I have to give up stuff that I’m not ready to part with. I’ve moved about 4 times in my life and it’s always super stressful. However I didn’t start having full on crying fits until I started moving with my husband (27m). He’s a “minimalist” and has moved ALOT his whole life so he doesn’t get attached to things and have to carry them around from place to place. I feel terrible that he has to deal with me and these crying fits. I legit cry a bunch when he suggested we part with something and we go back and forth for a bit. I get super sad and feel like I’m  dissociating after the crying stops.  Then I seek comfort from my partner only to start crying again and feeling drained. I’m not diagnosed with anything but ADHD, a panic disorder, major anxiety, and a dash of depressive episodes. so I’m not really sure why i keep having this intense reaction.

SpecialAd6199,Vent ! Something’s wrong with me and today made it worse,1,1bcmtev,0,"I don’t know if this is the right sub to post this in but I’m doing it anyways,
This has gone on for about 9 days 
(also I don’t have any hormonal imbalances or I’m not due so I don’t think it’s anything like that) but I (F14) have been crying more at night than usual and I don’t know why, I just kind of lay in bed and tear up.
I’ve also been getting horrible headaches recently and I don’t know if that and the crying is connected but I think they are, the headache pain is mostly behind my eyes and on the sides of my head above my ears and they usually happen either in the morning with toothache or at night after crying and I take 2 ibuprofens to stop them (3 for the toothache)
I know the headache after the crying is related but when I cry it’s not like pain crying yk? It’s more emotional crying and most of the time I don’t have a reason to be crying.
My sleeps also been getting worse, since about late January I’ve been staying up til 4-5am and waking up at 12-3pm, the reason I do this is because I like sleeping more than being awake. 
Bad thing about doing that is every time I stand up I can’t stand up for more than a minute without running out of breath and almost fainting.
I don’t go to school anymore (haven’t been since October 11th 2023) because of bullying and stress and my mum thinks I’m a failure because of it. All throughout Mother’s Day I cried and I kind of came to the realization that i don’t think my family like me that much, when I think of ending my life (which has been a lot more lately) I can’t think of anyone who’d genuinely care, mum, nan, uncles, aunts, siblings, friends, no one, yeah maybe they’d feel bad for the first couple weeks but then they’d just not care.
The reason I got taken out of school is because in October I tried to OD on ibuprofen(3200mg) which didn’t work (obviously) and I stayed in the hospital for a day, then in November I tried to OD again but on a bigger amount this time (7000mg) and ended up in the hospital for 2 days and got put on a waiting list to get a CAMHS worker but i probably won’t get one til around next year or two so now I kind of just stay at home listening to music and watching tv all day but it’s starting to get really boring and I want to do something with my life but my family won’t help me so why even bother. Eating has gotten worse as well, everytime I feel hungry I either can’t decide what to eat or every time I try and eat I feel sick to my stomach so I don’t really eat, I eat dinners and lunch’s with my family still but it just doesn’t feel right.
Sometimes when I fall asleep early I wake up in the middle of the night with this really strange off feeling, like I feel weird and….. I don’t know how to describe it but I just feel off, it’s like waking up from a nightmare but instead of feeling scared you feel strange instead.
Today (yesterday, I’m writing this at 2am) I went out with friends for the first time in months and in the middle of us hanging out (me and 2 girls) they kind of left me and went to theirs and wouldn’t let me in so I decided to walk home (7pm in the freezing cold dark) and I got followed by an old man (in his late 40s) and he kept complimenting me and when he got too close he pulled my hair and squeezes my chest and priv area but fortunately some guys saw and told him to get off and asked if I was okay and they walked me home, and I told my mum about it and she went hysterical and blamed me for it.
When I went to shower some of my hair was falling out and I had a big bruise on my chest and I kind of just stood there staring at my scars (I used to sh) I had been 5 months clean but I don’t know how much longer I can keep that up. 
Ever since I got out the shower I’ve been crying and sitting in pain with a horrible headache, I don’t wanna wake up tomorrow so I’m staying up as late as I can so tomorrow I’ll sleep in and won’t have to deal with them all.
I got SA’d when I was 4 and again now but the thing is I’m not sure if it was SA or not, I never consented but it didn’t feel like a bad thing(until the bruises) and i dont know what to do or who to tell without getting in trouble, ive been upset lately and then that happens and now i just feel like a filthy piece of shit and i just wanna relapse so bad but i dont want to at the same time and i cant stop crying over little things and my head hurts so fucking bad right now i just want to rip my eyes out.
I don’t think I’m depressed by the way, I’m diagnosed autistic and diagnosed ptsd but I feel like something’s missing..
Thanks if you’ve read all this and I’m sorry if some of it doesn’t make sense, i’ve been in agony writing this haha, but please if you have any advice to make myself feel better and to stop these excruciating headaches please lmk!!!

This included assault, rapid drug use, animal neglect, theft and probably anything else under the sun that would drive someone crazy. Got diagnosed with PTSD from it and have been in therapy recently. 

Someone in the comments of a posting I made at the height of a breakdown was very judgmental towards me and basically accused me of hating my sister kitty. Which couldn’t be more false. I love the kitten and bought its food and toys, cleaned its litter when my sister left it from weeks from when she was living at her old apartment to now so the kitty would “know it’s her smell” meanwhile it was overflowing.  yes I tried to tell her. She won’t listen and the smallest things turn volatile. 

What had happened is, when my sister moved in she wasn’t to bring her kitty (my sister has lost two cats as she left her door open 24/7 and we rescued a dog last year that is very anxious, like I’ve worked with anxious dogs, our dog is the most extreme case I’ve ever seen. We’ve  come a long way and trusts me my mom and my dad but she still need very controlled environments) also one of her many bfs she preys on was going to take it in. I advocated for it bc I like kitties and didn’t think it would turn to this. She was reminded many times the cat needs to stay in her portion of the home (large air conditioned laundry room +garage made into a bedroom) though she has trashed it to the point where it’s hazardous and I’m sure the poor kitty hates it in there. When I’ve interacted with the kitty she stays away from the mess on the ground and hangs anywhere on the wall /celling Also the times I have been around the kitty it was very sweet to me and rubbed against me and let me give her affection. I specifically bought kitten treats for it too. I love cats I’m still not over her first cat that she lost. 

The situation I was upset about was me having to witness someone neglecting their kitty, while trying to neglect my already anxious dog for her imaginary reasoning about my dog talking about things my dog has never done like being territorial? Also she is strictly to not have the kitty inside the kitchen and our bedrooms, my father is allergic. And the dogs (our one girl who I mentioned before and then our small chihuahua mix old man) are NOT supposed to be introduced without prior warning. Mt parents were both at work, I was asleep and woke up to her outside with the two dogs and kitty. This upset me but I know anything I say to her could cause altercation, also I genuinely care about the cat so without thinking I mention that our girl dog is being very curious and wagging her tail around the kitty. Still she has never met one and this alarmed me so I put myself between them. But while saying to my sister how calm my dog was being and I was proud. This then somehow triggered my sister to grab the dog by it’s collar and start punishing her by snapping profusely in her face. That is NOT how we scold our dogs and she did nothing to be scolded for! Her stance was her panic stance. I got a treat and brought my dog into my room. I was broken feeling powerless like I failed my dog but also feeling like I have no where else to turn


SO that’s what led (kinda and a lot of other stuff) to my erratic post. Now to that asshole I want to say: my sister lost her kitten. While taking her tiny kitten to play in the backyard in the middle of night she said it ran off with a stray cat. So where as you judged which I don’t even know how that conclusion was came too that I hate this kitty, I loved it and would much rather live with the kitty then her! I am sad for the cat of course but my biggest wish is that she doesent get a new one and hopefully the kitty stumbles into a nice old lady’s home . I can’t handle watching her neglect another animal while everyone tells me she’s fine. I had a little fantasy about finding the kitty and keeping it in my room with a clean nice litter box but I wouldent be able to do that.

 My sister also literally tried to kidnap my chihuahua mix a couple days ago when I told her I can feel his bloated tummy and he’s having diarreah so she needs to stop feeding him whatever the fuck she’s feeding him. I’m 24 and she’s 27 and I had to involve my parents because I was so afraid of her to get my pup back. I’m fighting such demons guys. Like it just gets worse and worse and worse started with her weirdly mistreating our anxious dog now she’s trying to steal my other dog like i really have no voice. I feel she is just obsessed with me and tried to destroy everything that I do in my daily life. I hate the negativity it fills me with 

The thing is, if this was done right and my sister didn’t make up all these things about the pets I think our dogs could even benefit from having a cat in the home. Our chi mix loves cats and is a protective lil guy who LOVES his sister (our rescue). She’s medium sized and seems very scared of dogs near her size & especially larger and never wants to interact. but when we see a small dog she now gets curious. I think this is because she trusts our chi mix. So i think the kitty could’ve been a healthy interaction for her. 

For some reason the comment I got felt so judgmental. Just made me feel so stupid for saying anything , I feel like everytime I finally break and complain this happens.  Something slaps me in the face to let me know how wrong I am to be having any pity for myself. I’ve never felt what it’s like for someone to “be there for me” I’ve always had to be the strong one and put up with her abuse. Sounds like I’m just feeling sorry for myself but really, my parents always tell me I’m stronger that’s why they are more harsh on me, because I can take it. But I don’t feel like I can take it anymore. I feel like I’m opening every door in an endless room and they are all empty like that feeling of confidence that what I’m thinking is valid and right will never happen. 

My parents are elderly and fighting g health issues. They don’t enjoy this but my sister hides most of her bad behavior from them or talks down to them for so long they give up. My mom especially is upset about our dog. We are being extra protective of them now but still. We have work and lives while all she does is stay there 24/7 and stalk everyone and steal. To me it’s obvious she’s on drugs but they aren’t convinced yet 

I am partially at fault as my post was the height of my anger, I haden’t been let sleep and I haden’t eaten for a long time. I was at a rock bottom scratching my mind for possibilities of how to calm the crazy. I called her names without thinking and didn’t give backstory to the situation which was upsetting me regarding our pets. This is just me being an asshole and saying f you to the guy who made me feel even crazier in my cry for help. Btw he deleted the comment after I replied and I deleted that post but I think an exact copy is up as I posted it on 2 pages so maybe I’m wrong and someone will tell me he had the right idea idk.

Smart-Asparagus3486,"Three years, two psychiatrist, one therapist all three broke up with me. What the hell?",1,1bc4zz4,3,"Last week I was having a terrible day and that day I was supposed to have an appointment with my psychiatrist. I emailed her let her know that I was struggling real hard and I wasn’t sure I was actually gonna make it out of bed to the appointment.
Her office lady calls me she tells me that my doctor is willing to do telehealth or to just cancel and reschedule for another day.
So I canceled, but it turns out that my psychiatrist was not OK with that in the office lady lied to me? 
I don’t know what else to call it besides lying to say that I could cancel and I could reschedule and it would be fine when I canceled and I cannot reschedule because now I don’t have a doctor because the doctor quit. 
Am I psychiatrist terminated Care term stopped being my doctor stopped treating me because I canceled that appointment last week which was a fourth cancellation in six months I guess? And that is apparently policy of hers that if you cancel for appointments in six months, she can just kick it to the curb and that’s that.

In summary, in the last three years, I had to leave a male psychiatrist because he was being mean very subtlely, but being mean to me. And I felt childish, and I couldn’t figure it out or cope with it, or even understand it, so I left him. 
Then I tell my therapist about a month and a half ago that I’ve relapsed and then I need help. I texted her because I’m  cowar. I’m waiting for her reply, and waiting and waiting and five days later she has still not answered me.. But she didn’t reply. I waited and waited. I waited five days. Text her asking what does this silence mean?
She finally replied, telling me that she is not there to enable my addiction. She is there to support my sobriety. So since I am actively using, she will not have sessions with me and she will not work with me. But I’m more than welcome to come back once I’m sober. what the fuck? That doesn’t even make sense. I need help now, when I’m using, just as much as I need help when I’m sober what the fuck?

I started the process of getting sober three days ago. And I began taking an anti-addiction medicine 3 days ago. I had a plan witith this psychiatrist to help me sober up. 
Last week on the day of our appointment I was miserable and struggling. I emailed her office that I might fail to show up but I’m trying really hard. The office lady calls me and tells me my doctor is willing to do telehealth, or cancel, and reschedule for a better time.

However, canceling and rescheduling was never an option. and canceling that appointment was a fourth cancellation strike that was violated, office policy, etc. etc. she quit.

This psychiatrist quit three days into me starting the sobriety process and three days into me taking an anti-addiction medication. She’s done she quit, and now I’m out here in limbo on my own and I don’t know what to do. 

What is going on in my life? What am I doing wrong that I am having doctors and therapist shut down on me?
I have never had a professional quit on me a doctor a teacher a boss. But all sudden the last three years I’ve had three medical people quit and walk away my therapist and two psychiatrist. What is wrong with me? What is going on? Why is this happening ?

I literally made the choice to start getting sober and I do start it and I’m doing it and three days in my Dr who is my teammate in this process stop being my doctor. 
I quit. It’s too much for today I quit. We’re done give up moving on. We’re gonna go to work and pretend like nothing else is going on in the world because I can’t do this.

Edit (add info):  I quit on the male psychiatrist because he shamed me and gaslighted me by telling me my feelings were not real, and therefore not valid they could not be real because those feelings were impossible to have as a reaction to what we’re doing. 
Having a mental health professional deny, the reality of feelings, and then invalidate them was mind blowing because he’s a mental health professional, and that’s not how feelings work.
The way he gaslight me, I’d only run into in personal relationships with men. I never had a professional gaslight me at all let alone gaslight me with my feelings aren’t real. He was using the exact same misogynistic stance that all the most men to use when they gaslight. The position of he was correct. He knew best there was in since he was right, and he knew my feelings were definitely not a response that was possible therefore we’re not real. Vegas heels, and commit to his position and gaslight you. Hell no no no no I walked away and that was a valid. That was not my doing.

When my therapist quit on me in response to me, letting her know I had relapsed and I was asking for help was confusing to me.  So I went out and asked some friends the Internet couple people in my family asking if that’s a normal thing that therapist will refuse to treat you if you are actively using. There was unanimous agreement that it is not typical for a therapist to stop treating a client who has known substance abuse issues because they relapsed, which is a very normal part of the treating addiction. But also that she had the right to quit anytime and that’s fine but that it was not a typical response of a therapist to a relapse and their client asking for help which was very reassuring because I was so confused. I never told a therapist let alone any medical professional ever about drugs just had never done this. This time I need to get it official and done right. So the first mental health, professionally approach and tell quits on me because I’m using and they will not treat me when actively using. I was contemplating that like wait a second so if you’re an addict and you relapse, the therapist won’t work with you while you’re using even though we are asking for their help to stop using? And also like do doctors do this if I tell my doctor am I gonna lose my doctor too? I was very confused very concerned, but turns out whatever her issue was that’s not normal behavior for a therapist. There is not a standard saying, don’t treat active users, and it was extremely unlikely that my doctor would quit on me for relapse. 
So I was just weird and abnormal, and was in no way my fault created by my doing 

In this last doctor, the psychiatrist who quit I realized tonight that the policy violation she used to justify discharging me was false. She claimed I’d violated the policy of canceling 4 appointments within a 6 time frame. But the thing is the visit that I rescheduled was our fifth meeting. She was a brand new doctor. I’ve seen her four times that’s that’s all just for visits. Therefore I did not violate that policy because I went to every single of those appointments. I didn’t cancel any of the first four appointments, and I was rescheduling the fifth granted we had important things to talk about at the fifth appointment but my rescheduling that was 100% necessary due to having a day where I couldn’t get out of bed I couldn’t function. So having a doctor discharge you using a false reason that isn’t even possible to have happened because you hadn’t been seeing that doctor for the time period necessary to violate that palsy, and let alone if I canceled all four appointments in six months, I wouldn’t have seen her at all we wouldn’t have had a single meeting that’s insane and that is no way on me or my fault

,Term 'we are not our thoughts' caused me slight dissociation,0,1bc3tmn,0,"I have been reading about this concept, and it has only caused me pain. So if if I think about how much I like certain song then it's a lie? Things I enjoy immensely always find a way to transfer from my emotions to my thoughts, and I always found it helpful towards the journey of self discovery. We have so many complex systems that work as one whole now tell me how does that not shape or personality and Who We Are.. So every single thing that my thoughts tell me I enjoy, is a lie?  Every observation I have in the outside world where:  I  meet a random person and I like them  and I think to myself that I really do like them, then everything I think to myself in any kind of a situation is false, and it has nothing to do with me? 
I find it impossible to believe that our thoughts are not connected to our personality in any way. In a lot of ways they guide us towards her interests, our Hobbies, our relationships, so how can none of it be apart of Who We Are? Can  someone tell me that some of our some of our thoughts  are apart of our personality, because now I feel my interests are meaningless my relationships are meaningless my taste in anything I like is meaningless because anything my thoughts tell me I like is apparently false and and tells us nothing about ourselves...
I'll give you an example I see something I like, then I have a thought that the thing I see looks amazing, and then that's thought produces an emotion that makes me feel good and at the same time I discover what I like, so tell me how how the thoughts we have are not stepping stones towards myself...

Before all this I’ve been mentally struggling. I went off my meds for bipolar 1 with the idea maybe I was doing better and could handle things- maybe a month ago? 

  Things were fine and I was stable. A couple weeks, if that. It started getting off. Weird. Emotional all the time, anxiety through the roof, taking my as needed anxiety meds constantly. My little sister was hospitalized and my cat needed to be taken to the vet on top of stress at work and my looming birthday. I have time anxiety so I just assumed everything bad was happening at once and this was surely a natural reaction. 

  But it’s after my trip now. I feel very heavy and sad. Like if I got really sick or hurt, I wouldn’t fight for my life. I’d let go. I don’t want to keep existing. I know I have passive ideations. And those are not in crisis. But at the same time it feels like alarms are going off in my head that are saying this isn’t a normal depression. 

I don’t know, maybe I’m being dramatic. I stopped the meds and did this to myself. Talk therapy doesn’t help. I can’t seem to stay consistent with the meds. It’s pathetic of me, others have it worse. But this mental pain feels almost unbearable. I’m struggling to keep this up but don’t want to tell anyone. Thank you.

Now that ive been moved out for a few years and living alone/being in charge of my own mental health care is really weird.

I get so upset with myself and get so angry not understanding why am being so lazy and start thinking ""my mother was right"" kind of thoughts.

Its kind of releaving because at least Im not blaming myself as much, but then I think about how badly I need to get further mental health care now that I can. My biggest struggle right now is that while Im not depressed, I put it on the back burner so much bc I genuinely feel like ""Im not even that bad ill be fine"" lol.

cherryblossomtulip,The worst anxiety of my life,3,1bbhlyx,1,"Hello 🌸
Im (age 22) desperately looking for help from everyone who suffered/suffers from anxiety or a panic disorder. 

My story in short form is that i had panic attacks since i was 10, in moments where i felt trapped and couldnt leave the place easily (classrooms, crowds of people, train drives …)
With therapy i could handle it and became a nurse to help other people with this problem. 
June 2023 something changed. I drove the train home and suddenly had the worst panic attack of my life. I had so many panic attacks and never experienced this type of fear before. 
Since this day i was never calm or relaxed. 
For weeks i couldnt leave my house, but even in my safe space i have unimaginable fear. 
I‘ve tried different antidepressants, right now im taking 100mg Sertraline/Zoloft, my mood is better but the fear is the same. 

Im in therapy but it is not helping, because i cant even explain what im afraid about. Im scared of everything, its like my brain is permanently ready to fight something and i cant turn it off or calm me down. At the same time i have the worst derealization feelings. 
It has almost been a year since i last felt safe and im scared its gonna be like this forever. 

I started to think if it was a physical reaction? 
Because why did it happen so suddenly and why am i not able to control it, even though i have so much willpower. 
I always had an iron deficiency, but the last time i got it checked it was just slightly low.
Could it still be that? 

Sometimes its calming to read similar stories, especially if they have a happy ending 🥹

If anyone has a tip i would be so grateful.
I want to live again. 

I hope you are well 🌸

zayahroman24,My step father ruined my well being TW self harm and suicide,1,1bbo10y,0,"When I was a younger, I used to be all happy and optimistic and bubbly but when my mom re married to my narcissistic step father and moved to his house, I noticed that I've become more irritated, angry, stressful, depressed, restless, unhinged, fearful, liar and developed self harm. He believes he is always right, super strict and expects us to be perfect. He is never physically abusive but he has told me multiple times that I'm useless, stupid and lazy  just because I missed a spot in cleaning the floors and misplaced an item. He also gets mad when my mom texts briefly on the phone while on the dinnertable but he always is on his tablet, computer and phone when he's texting and watching basketball games but we don't say anything because he's going to put the blame on us instead of reflecting upon himself. When I get into an argument with him, my mom calms me down and tells me to be patient with him because he's not perfect and what I've noticed is that whenever my mother says ""he is not perfect"" he'd get even more pissed and taunts I and my brother. I don't even smile whenever I'm around him. I can't play with my brother, talk with him or laugh if he is around because I feel very worthless, stupid, dumb and anything if I try to show genuine happiness if he's around. Whenever I eat with my family, I always look down when eating and I keep silent and I don't want my mother to talk to me or anything about me, even my achievements when my step father is around because whenever he learns that I'm interested in something,  he uses that against me when I do something wrong. He said ""you should leave JROTC if you don't even know how to rill a sleeping bag"", ""you keep spilling food because you got last place in the drone competition"", ""you want join the military but can't even sweep all the floors?"" When he's done eating and leaves the dinner table to his office then I start being talkative with my brother and mother but if he gets out of his room while I talk, I remove my smile immediately and stay silent. I always do this when I'm with people and he shows up. I believe that it's wrong to be happy when he is around. 

He says I'm lazy even though I clean the house when he tells me to or not and get almost straight As in school in which I only have one non-As which is a B+. I clean the house when my parents are not here and that's what he says. He says we need to clean the house even if he doesn't order us to. My brother is an addict to his phone. He cannot leave it and is always on his damn phone. He gets in trouble for always being on his phone. I have to tell him to help me clean the house because he doesn't have the initiative. I always want to keep everything perfect because one single mistake I make, my step dad yells at me and calls me lazy, disorganized and weak. But, when I remind my brother to do his job and help me clean and my step dad hears it, he gets mad at me instead because he says I'm passing my job to him and that I'm lazy to clean so I'm telling my brother to do it for me. Like I've said, my brother is an addict to his phone and when I tell him to help me he says he will and he doesn't and it irritates me to the point that earlier when his friend was over here playing mobile games and my step dad told me to sweep the front house and back and clean the windows and he called me lazy with that too that I was so mad avout everything he'd done to me that I stormed to my brother with his friend and yelled at him to help me clean and then my step dad gets mad at me and tells me again I'm passing my job to him and I'm lazy. I get that I should've never yelled when there was a stanger over but I couldn't help myself. My step dad got mad even more at me than my brother. He treats him better than me and gets mad at him less. He doesn't get as mad at my brother if he did his chores wrong compared to me. I think it's because before I heard him say I should primarily clean the house more because it's a girl's job to do so and that I was older than my brother even though we're just ages apart and I should help him but whenever I direct him to do his stuff my step dad gets mad at me for telling me telling my brother what to do. My brother doesn't even have time for me anymore because everyday all of his hours are on the phone and only a few minutes for me a day and if his phone is taken then all his attention goes to his Switch or TV.

My step father is a perfectionist so he expects everything to be perfect or he yells, ridicules and insults me if I do something wrong. Because of that, I became like him too, which I hate. I became more irritated if nothing is made on the spot and if people don't listen to me. If my brother doesn't listen to my orders I start screeching at him and yelling and I get something sharp and cut scars on my arms if he doesn't listen and I start getting really bad tantrums where I fall on the floor, crying so badly that my body starts shaking uncontrollably and I get a super hard time breathing. This has been going on for years. I've had multiple amounts of these tantrums. I fear that if nothing gets right based on what he wants, he'll ridicule me even more. I became like my step father to my brother. If he doesn't listen to me, I start yelling at him and insulting him and berating him out of fear that he will not do his chores and because the chores aren't done, my step father will yell at us. I don't wanna be like him and I don't choose to be like this but because of him, I'm less tolerant, more irritated and furious ans anxious and stressful. If I call put his wrongdoings and hypocrisy, the blame will be on me and so I don't even bother defending myself so I just take it in and go to my room after and I cry or pray to God hoping things will get better. I can't be happy in front of him even if I'm always happy and joyful to other people. 

Another thing is that he is very fake. With other people and children, he seems like a very noble, tolerating, kind, nice and respectable man and he talks to other people with respect and if they accidentally do something wrong, he is fine with it but compared to us, he talks like we're his workers. Because of his constant berrating, I've developed a sense of invalidity to myself and insecurity. I've always wished how he's talk to me like how he talks to other children. He treats other kids better than me. He talks so mellow and nice compared to me, he talks very sternly as if he's always irritated. He also laughs at me and makes jokes about me. He make it seem to other people that we're a happy family. I will consider that I have a happy family only if he's not around. How I wished he'd treat me with more tolerance and love but no. He even says I'm the laziest person who he has ever met even though he has been to multiple houses where it is very disorganized and dirty and their children sit around playing video games and he has the audacity to say that to me when I don't even face him with my phone and I completely stop doing everything I'm doing just to listen to him? He even says I mess up his instructions because I always wear my headphones when I NEVER face him with something in my ear so he can't be making those things up because I am genuinely terrified of him. He just wants something to justify his berating at me that he makes scenarios that never happened because I attest that I give my full attention when he talks to me. I stand up, drop anything I'm doing, look down, agree to everything he says, every damn thing I do just to please him and he still believes I'm useless. I buy him gifts on father's day and on his birthday but his niceness only lasts for a day and it's back to making fun of me again unless if we're out and he has to pretend again. He doesn't make me defend myself because he gets aggressive with arguments and he always wants to be right so we don't even dare argue with him.

He treats my mother kindly but he still sometimes talk to her with a harsh tone, especially during an argument where he also insults her and yells at her. But to me and my brother? He barely talks to us in a kind manner. I want everything to be clean, even my room and I share my room to my brother and he is always the one that messes the room so I too yell at him like my step father because I'm anxious, stressed, scared and irritated that he might come inside our room and see that my drawer is broken because if I break something, he always says I don't take care of it and I'm too lazy to do so. So whenever I hear his footsteps pass out room, I close the lights. If I yell at my brother, I don't mean to do so but because of how scares I am, I become stressed and start doing so but I feel bad afterwards and I say sorry and my whole mood changes from happy again. I don't get it. I'm a super happy and optimistic person but all of a sudden it all drops down to extreme anxiety, fear, anger, stress snd irritation. I'm all happy with my mom but the second I see something or remember something that reminds me of my step father I start panicking even if I see him everyday. I was happy before, I still am. But if he's around, all my happiness disappears and anxiety starts getting the best of me. I improve everything because of him but it's still not enough because I remember him saying we have to be perfect. All his ridiculing too removes any positive emotions in my mind that I get burnt out and lose hope. I almost killed myself from overdose because of him but luckily, the multiple medicines along with half a cup of bleach I consumed just made me fall asleep. I always thank God that he's kept me tough and gave me someone like my mother. I haven't killed myself or attempted because I know thg at if I am gone, my family wnd the people who love me will all grieve. I just think to myself that there are people who do love me despite my imperfections. I will not let one man destroy my life but sometimes, I lose all hope and feel terrible. I just think to myself that I only have 2 years before I move out, join the military and go to university. I believe through my family's love and God, I can get through this. I pray that someday, my step father will learn to love me and treat me right. This is not everything he has done wrong because I can't type everything but most of these left a mark on me and destroyed my childhood and happiness. Though he hurts my well being, I will continue to be brave and will treat others kindly, I will also treat him kindly but I will also need to know how to accept myself and stand up. My step father had a rough childhood so it's maybe why he acts this way but even if I'm also discouraged by him, I will still continue to treat everyone with love how they want to be loved, I shall do that to him as well. When I have kids, I will never ridicule them like that and discourage them because that will ruin their well beings and keep their distance from me. I was close to my step father when I was younger but when I lived with him, he started making fun of me so I grew apart from him. May God so help him and I and everyone I love.",1710112064.0,
ChiMeraRa,Synchronicity - a hidden relationship with mental health conditions,1,1bbmwof,2,"Synchronicity is a term coined by Dr. Carl Jung, it means meaningful coincidences of a personal nature, such as always seeing a special number, getting a message from the universe, and having the television/Netflix repeat your thoughts.

The prevalence of mental health conditions is greater in the synchronicity population, at least 1 in 3 has mental illness, compared to the general population at 1 in 8.

Individuals with mental illness with psychotic features will likely observe these meaningful coincidences, much more so than the general population. 

Is this you? Please let me know in comments.

Synchronicity is not mental illness, but in the susceptible, or those vulnerable to sudden changes in neurotransmitter levels, these deeply personal coincidences may trigger or exacerbate mental health conditions.

Let your doctor know you are experiencing coincidences for beginning of proper management!",1710109255.0,
ZealousidealPiano338,Is it normal to stop having nightmares for months???,1,1bbjfwh,0,"📌‼️Trigger warning I talk about nightmares and abuse‼️

Like the title says, I stopped having dreams 7months ago since I entered a relationship and then after they broke up with me and I haven’t had a cptsd nightmare since. 
I also have Bpd so my last gf leaving me and cheating on me was probably the worst thing that she could’ve done.

Ik I technically still have cptsd and my therapist approves bc I still get flashbacks, get paralyzed, have a crazy amount of anxiety/stress when I think about my traumatic events. 
It’s also even more difficult to heal bc I still live in the house that I got years of abuse of. Everything reminds me of my abuse.
I am also a 17 girl.
Anyways I just hope that going to therapy for a year helped me heal and that the reason why I’m not getting nightmares anymore is bc I’m healing.
But imagine I’m not actually healing and my head is just still preoccupied of thinking about my past relationship and how I still love her so much.

Mammoth-Novel2453,Trying to find the best way to navigate post-depression,1,1bbica0,0," I was depressed (undiagnosed) between the ages of like 13 and 17. Got diagnosed + a therapist at like 18, and started SSRIs. At 19 I attempted twice. After the second attempt, due to various reasons include behavioural changes and lessons learned, I started improving and escaped the hellhole. about six months after the 2nd attempt, I felt so secure and confident in my mental state that I secretly weened myself off of the Prozac (I do NOT recommend this). I am now 21 and that attempt feels like 50 years ago. I am a completely different person. I am content. my mood for the last 2 years ranges from a 4/10 - 8/10 consistently and I couldn't be more grateful.

&#x200B;

Now, the 2nd attempt was a very traumatic moment for me and my family. There is still a lot of dissociation there. And there is some level of insecurity I have towards that event. Don't get me wrong, I am like 80% ""over it"". As soon as it happened and I started recovering I vowed to myself to take it in stride, forget the past, and move forward. And I did. In these 2 years the worst depressive episodes I get are like 2 days long and absolutely NOTHING compared to what I went through previously.

&#x200B;

Trauma is complicated. And the research is conflicting. Many experts believe forgetting trauma is actually the best thing to do. Don't interfere with the process. Your mind will bring the trauma forth whenever you're ready for it. But this might apply more to childhood traumas? I'm not entirely sure. Also therapists provide a safe and professional space to discuss traumas and some say that you shouldn't think about it too much outside of sessions. However this is nuanced because part of my drive/way of framing this whole ordeal is by adopting the mentality of ""that was a part of my journey, a part of my story, and I wouldn't be who I am today if it didn't happen. It had to happen"". And forgetting it would be adopting the opposite approach.

&#x200B;

This might seem silly because you'll just say ""just keep doing what you're doing you seem to be doing great"", but honestly the primary driver for this post is a tattoo idea I have had. This would be my first tattoo. I have had an idea for a while to get a Sisyphus tattoo on my inner left forearm. This has 2 meanings to me. Number 1, it's a nod to my personal philosophy and my favourite literature, ""absurdist"" philosophy and the works of Albert Camus. But it's also an overarching symbol of overcoming adversity. A way to tell myself ""you are battle scarred but goddamn look where you are now. Nothing can phase you anymore"".

&#x200B;

The conflict in my head is this: If I put that on my body, am I overly identifying with the attempt? I am not JUST some dude who overcame big struggles. If I have that tattoo, would that be a way of being stuck in that mindset of the dude who's recovering/healing? Do you guys know what I mean? This dialogue in my head got me thinking, what's the perfect balance between forgetting/moving through life, and identifying with the trauma, and adopting it to be an important part of my life story, and boosting my sense of identity? Don't get me wrong, I don't think about and remember the events of the attempt every single day, not even every week. Maybe like biweekly when I journal or something. I feel that tattoo, and remembering the event could maybe be a positive thing? When I look at it or talk to someone about it (the tattoo), I won't necessarily be thinking about the exact traumatic event, but it will be a reminder of my struggles, one that might make me feel proud. But on the other hand, I am at a point in my healing where, like I said, that period feels like ages ago. you guys see the conflict here?

bipolar_express11,Overlapping Mental Diagnoses,1,1bbi2un,4,"Hello— I am wondering how other people with many overlapping symptoms of mental health disorders have been diagnosed and how your practitioner has managed medication (if applicable). I know it’s really hard to rule out certain disorders when the symptoms overlap so much, so it’s actually been hard for my psychiatrist to tell how I need to be medicated since I was so unstable for a while, he was desperate to make sure I wasn’t going to end up in the hospital. 

I am diagnosed with like 4 mental disorders. I first was diagnosed with anxiety at age 6, OCD at 12, depression at 15, Bipolar II at 16, and ADHD at 18. I also have a nonverbal learning disorder. My family on both sides have a loooong history of many mental illnesses (ex. Bipolar, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, autism). However, my mom is worried that I’m being over-medicated, but my psychiatrist (who I’ve had for 2 years) is very experienced and I do trust him. He says that the medications I’m on don’t have long term or harmful side effects (other than potentially Ritalin), so as long as I’m stable, it’s okay. I’m on lamotrigine, Guanfacine, venlafaxine, and methylphenidate (Ritalin). I’m hoping to go off a few of them someday, but I’m really worried I’d break down and have issues at college.

Uncouth_Cat,things might be getting better and idk how to handle it.  ,2,1bb6sq1,2,"Hi, new to this sub.... Arrogant title, i know, but if anyone has the same anxieties, id love any advice on how to handle it. Otherwise its a bit of a vent...

TL;DR is the title. my health is improving and idk what to do with the feeling, it is so foreign to me.

Things are getting better. Compared to where I was just a couple years ago, I am doing really good. But idk how to handle it or what to do with it. I haven't felt good for a really long time. I'm comfortable in depression, and its scary to be in good spirits all of the time...

I (27f) have a lot of shit going on.. i think there's a word for it? idk. But diagnosed with GAD, bipolar II, clinical depression, ADHD, and JME (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). My meds affect my moods and appetite, and honestly everything sorta overlaps... My mental health/stress/fatigue affects my seizure threshhold, so its been really important for me to manage my mental health better. I had a big seizure 2021 (i think) in the midst of a mental breakdown, and have been recovering since. Long story short, a lot was going on in my life regarding relationships and job stress.

So intros out of the way- things have been getting better. Ive had insomnia since middle school, when the epilepsy set in. Ive struggled to sleep more than 4 hours a night (non-consexutively) for like more than a decade; this past month my sleep has been improving, and i think i just got 6 hours straight of sleep??? I even went to bed earlier. I have a job that doesnt totally suck- the pay does ofc, but my coworkers are fun, and do their jobs, and i am being given healthy challenges. My boyfriend and I worked things out and since we've gotten back together, we've been doing really good and things have changed. I started putting effort into the right friendships, and I am being rewarded by friends wanting to be there for me and include me- we all still struggle ofc, but its been... better. Im eating healthier too. and since i cant drive, i got an escooter that has been getting me to and from work so I am saving money, and have gained more confidence and independence.

The tragic thing is my cat passed away. She got me through a lot, and was there when no one else was or could be. Its been about a week now and i realized that I'm going to be ok. idk if that wouldve been true 2 years ago... She got me here, and I owe her that. But now idk what to do.

I find myself, yesterday and rn (4 am lol), ruminating and *trying* to fall back into a depressive state. Idk if this is hypomania, or what, but im not thinking so. With the changes in enviornment, i feel like my meds are actually doing their whole job, and my clarity has improved. (im on lamotragine for epilepsy, but it doubles as a mood-stabilizer. I was confused why i was still feeling crazy, and psychiatrist told me it should help with it.) Like. Its. kinda difficult for me to fully spiral lmao. which could totally be hypomania still. But i havent ordered anything useless for like 3 months. I still have savings, like...

so all this is good. And usually when Im in better moods, i can feel the other shoe about to drop. But its not like that right now. And instead of relief I feel a creeping anxiety. Idk how to handle ""Good.""

My whole life, for maybe the past 15yrs or so, has been wrapped around my issues. My epilepsy, the side effects of drugs, my insomniatic routines of having 4 hours of nice, quiet alone time, my previous inability to be independant, indulging in sugars and guilty pleasures because why does it even matter?

What do I do with this impending sense of responsibility? I feel bad. Ive been craving independance but now its scary. Ive been begging for sleep, but idk what to do with all this energy and productivity levels. I am now capable and there are no excuses except for my lack of knowledge, as a grown ass adult, on how to properly function in society. like for reals.

I dont want to self sabatouge. I cant! I know better now!!! I just. literally dont know what to do. failure is a familiar taste, but success Ive barely taken a few bites.

Disastrous-Air-6496,Descent into madness.,1,1bb67n2,0," 

I made a throwaway for this post.

I am autistic, probably more specifically aspergers, diagnosed as the former. My parents, siblings, uncles, aunts, and grandparents were never abusive. 

I seem to have a number of issues. I have always had horrific sleep, which doesn't help. I had problem binge drinking a few years ago but it's been nearly a year since I've drank anything, and over a year since I have drunk more than a can in a month. I've had cannabis twice as regular doses each, but that was 4 years ago. I was an adult a bit over the age of majority when I did. I also had a bad time through a divorce which happened when I was a teenager. My parents were still amicable but it completely devastated me for years. I completed high school but could never get through more than six months of college, done in two phases of about 3 months in each attempt. No criminal record or record of illegal drug use.

But another big issue are intrusive thoughts on a constant basis, usually tied to mature topics, like how I keep thinking of the Green Mile movie when I think of a character in anime named Kino Makoto when she is fighting, whose powers are based on violent electricity, or being unable to keep off overly complicated and unhealthy amounts of time spent to overthink things, like the Earth's destruction by the sun in seven billion years. I've even had nightmares where scientists narrate my dreams talking about it. When I get into these topics, often going from place to place with them, like how if they have these parents then they are also related to these other people, or otherwise in that line, I can end up a lot of times managing to find the darkest or sexual interpretation of things or eventually trying to repivot to something cutesy or childish but then realizing that I'm still embedded in the former kind of environment and then feel anguish of the juxtaposition of the two kinds of extremes and how they definitely should not be combined.

I also have a strange paranoia around other people I don't know, almost like just anyone else might take out a pistol and hurt me in particular for no rhyme or reason, even though I know it's almost certainly not going to happen. I'm fascinated with the mechanical processes of firearms and the history of countries' processes for them but I do not want a firearm and I am not applying for the relevant licenses to have one, and I don't go around places with weapons either.

It feels like at some point I might do something wrong, not for a sadistic purpose or for greed but like getting into a bad traffic accident just because I momentarily might get into a car at a time I might meltdown or look at the moon over the horizon as a steady reminder of time and stability in the universe. I don't often cry, but every few months I do with all this bubbling in my head. My short term memory is terrible even though I have excellent memory for information about the world like how train pantographs work (the part that makes electric trains connect to overhead wires). I have a few memories from long ago as a kid that I try to bring up for comfort but then I feel often worse after and feel like a loser of some kind for depending on such things or how it is so different from what I am interested in now and how I must surely be capable of doing more in the world with the things I know.

I even feel like I would be a horrific parent if I ever was a parent, having no idea how to raise a child or that I'd inflict on them the bad genetic lotteries I have and that I wouldn't give them the love and attention I know they would deserve and make so many thousands of mistakes because I don't know what to do for them, and I wonder who else must actually love me as a person with so few people who actually know me well, and how I feel like I do things for others to just not let them down. I wonder how my mother and brother can feel anything from their religious beliefs and why they literally feel communion with others and I can't with the emotion that should go into it, and their relationships with others.

New_Condition_7416,How do I support my LDR girlfriend as she battles psychosis?,3,1bah3my,0,"# How do I support my LDR girlfriend as she battles psychosis? 

# To start off, it is important to mention that we are in a long distance relationship- so I am hoping this reaches people that are in long distance relationships as well. 

My girlfriend and I, (we're lesbians) have been together for coming up on 2 years. In these past two years, we have had the opportunity to see each other quite often. We built a very strong partnership and understanding of each other's struggles. I was always aware that there would eventually be more to learn about how to be a partner to her when her mental struggles become more debilitating, in fact it is one of my biggest goals this year, to learn more in a proactive way. 

But, earlier this year, in January, her mental health rapidly declined. I did not know then, but she was experiencing the starting stage of psychosis. I tried to help her out of it, ground her, I tried to use logic, which I now know will not truly help until she is at the very least in the recovery stage.

Ever since, our communication has declined as well, as being in a long distance relationship requires a lot of a person in terms of outreach and the ability to regularly handle complex conversations. I for lack of a better phrase, have been scrambling to adjust to the ebbs and flows of this circumstance as far as how it has affected our relationship, and what I know about being her partner. 

We currently are taking space from constant communication, and generally the regular expectations of what a LDR entails. It took us some time to get to this point, as we realized it would be healthier for us both. I truly gave my all, but I know now that I need to educate myself on where to place my efforts. I am doing my best to remember that it is not my fault that I did not fully know how to care for her in these circumstances. She deserves a partner that is ready to grow and accept the task at hand when it comes to being there for her when/if she experiences a psychosis episode. I want to be there when she is ready. 

I think it's also important to note that she was previously also diagnosed with OCD.

I know I have a lot to learn, a lot of things I will only truly be able to grasp once I am met with them in real life, but I want to start doing my own journey of self education in the meantime, while she is going through recovery and treatment with the care of her mother. 

It has been a painful and unpredictable journey to say the least, there have been countless nights where I have felt lost and I fear losing her at times. Her health, her well-being, and our relationship mean the world to me. I can't deny that it has been hard on me emotionally, but I find that my motivation to hold my head up higher is stronger than all of the darkest days. 

I really just want to give myself a realistic set of goals, that are attainable as a start. 

I would appreciate insight of others and their experiences as well.

I'm a 27-year-old Software Engineer currently based in Bangalore. Recently, my parents have begun searching for potential partners for me as I've been single for the entirety of my life. I haven't been in a relationship with any woman thus far.

I earn a decent salary, approximately 20LPA, and I lead a healthy lifestyle—I neither drink nor smoke. Additionally, I possess all the financial and asset requirements necessary for an arranged marriage. I would describe my appearance as decent.

However, I've been feeling increasingly disheartened as I've experienced instances of being ghosted or rejected by potential marriage matches. I find myself struggling to comprehend the reasons behind these rejections. This has left me feeling useless, like a failure, and has caused me to lose interest in many aspects of my life.

Furthermore, I can't help but feel sorry for my parents as they too are affected by my unsuccessful attempts at finding a partner.

I'm reaching out for assistance as I've been grappling with feelings of despair. I lack the motivation to take action and find myself in a constant state of self-doubt. The ridicule from my friends, who mock me for being rejected by women, only exacerbates these feelings.

ParadigmShift007,How to STOP Nervousness EFFECTIVELY,0,1b9t19d,0," 

Nervousness is something we all experience at various points in our lives. Whether it’s before a big presentation, a job interview, or a social event,

I remember one time I had to give a speech in front of my whole class. I was so nervous, I couldn’t even say my name. And That’s how powerful nervousness can be.

You might already know some common ways to deal with nervousness, like taking deep breaths, chewing gum, or thinking positively.

But while finding a better solution on how I can overcome nervousness, I found a great research study on the neuroscience of Visualization.

Now, you might be wondering, how can visualization help with nervousness?

You see, Visualization is the process of creating mental images or pictures in one’s mind.

It involves using sensory information and the imagination to simulate experiences and situations that feel real despite not being physically present. And research has shown that the brain often can’t tell the difference between a visualized image and actual reality. This means that when you visualize a specific action or outcome, the same areas of your brain are activated as when you actually perform that action.

If you want to have a better understanding on how visualization helps to overcome nervousness, I have created an animated video to share what I learned.

So, this happened about 3 months ago right after finals I wanted to relax so I got high, I had to pass drug tests for my co-op, so my tolerance was very low, and I took more than I normally do and I was also high alone in my college apartment which is never the case.

I was playing COD with my buddies online. I took way too much edible (120 mg) and this made me very anxious and also took 200 mg of caffeine of reign. So, then I thought I heard something, and I ripped my headphones off, and it sounded like my neighbors/someone in the hallway, but I was so high that it made it sound like it was in my apartment.

This made me super anxious, because I thought what I was hearing was not real (but in hindight it probably was). Then my friends got off and I stayed on because I was super anxious that I would hear something and I wanted them to stay on because I thought I was going to hallucinate and hear something not real when I took my headphones off. Then when I eventually did take my headphones off I was so tired and anxious.

This led to me hearing what sounded like intelligible conversation(I also had a ton of white noise in my room) and this made me freak out into a panic attack, because I thought I was in psychosis. I had no delusions, messages, or anything from what I thought I heard.  My tinnitus was so bad (always is when I am high) that I couldn't tell where I was coming from but it sounded like white noise in my apartment. I went to sleep and felt completely normal the next day until I googled schizophrenia symptoms and now, I am very anxious about getting it.


This has made grad school near impossible this semester and I am struggling under the stress of school and this stupid crap I should have never done.

Sorry, that is a lot, but I do not think like that anymore. Do I have any reasons to be concerned at all?? Is this normal? I am sorry, I just wish I never got high, and I am scared I screwed up my mind and my career. Yes, I am **NOT** getting high EVER again.

Once again, my pcp, psych, and 2 therapists are **NOT concerned but I am**. This anxiety has been extreme because I am so scared of schizophrenia.

**My psych said this:**

He was extremely confident that I didn’t experience psychosis and that my anxiety was making me hear stuff because I was anxious about hearing stuff.

He said audio distortions can happen with extreme anxiety and combine that with the psychoactive ingredients in thc it caused me to freak out.  

He also said in 25 years hes been a psychiatrist he has seen psychosis and people with “nondecript” symptoms that I have experienced.  He said he has never had someone develop a psychotic disorder with nondescript symptoms that I had experienced.",1709867511.0,

No_Relief_6560,"is this a sign of any ""mental illness"" or is this normal? ",0,1b99fn8,1,"so ive noticed i get really bad mood swings. this is just an example but basically me and my friend had a sleepover a few weeks ago and we were having a great time. we went out and we were laughing, talking, smiling ect and  just enjoying ourself. i was really hyper in the evening like i was laughing the whole time and being really loud not caring about what others thought but then i js ""changed"". the next day, in the morning i was fine but then near to midday my whole mood just disappeared. i wasn't talking or laughing and unless my friend said something to me i didn't say anything at all. i didn't wanna see anyone or talk to anyone, and this lasted for about im guessing a few days (like 5 days??). for most of that week at school i wasn't like smiling or laughing. whenever it was break/lunch i would just stand there in silence while my friends js talked and i wouldn't wanna join in in anything or talk to anyone. my friends would normally get kinda annoyed at this and i don't blame them i js don't know why it happens. it's happened a few times but it doesn't last for over a week, sometimes its just for a few hours and sometimes it's for a few days. i would tell myself to try join in conversations, start being more happy and just like stop being moody but i just physically couldn't. i really wanted to but like my brain i guess js wouldn't let me. this doesn't happen like very often, it happens every once in a while for different time periods and i don't know why. 

it's not js this but like id also randomly really sad. like id feel like im about to start crying even tho nothings happened or id be really happy and talk loads ect. 

i also have a problem with concentration. i know it's normal to zone out but for me it happens really often. for example, im a really slow understander, like im not ""dumb"" it's just some thinfs i really don't get and most my english lessons are one of thoes things. i would tell myself to actually listen/focus but id always zone out. like if we were reading a text i would be following along like reading it but i wouldn't be concentrating if that makes sense.like im reading it but my mind isn't actually focused on it im js reading it along if that makes sense. ive always been bad at concentrating and that also switches up a lot. for example in my science class when we were doing work/answering questions from a textbook i was doing the work fine and doing all the questions even tho the class was really loud. but in my math class, we were doing the same thing answering questions but the class was really loud too and i couldn't concentrate at all. sometimes even when the class is silent i can't focus on anything, like my brain wouldn't be able to read the words properly anr everything would js get confusing. 

another thing is my anger. im not trying to self diagnosis myself with anything but i get mad SUPER easily and by the smallest things. whenever i would get mad my body (mostly my legs) would start feeling weird?? i don't know how to explain it but you know that feeling in your legs when you csnt keep them still and have to keep moving them? it's like that. i would js get angry over the smallest things ever and i don't know if it's normal. 

i mostly need help with the first paragraph i wrote but if anyone has any thoughts about this in general, commenting would be greatt <3",1709856099.0,

Gloomy_Albatross3043,I'm really confused about myself ,2,1b8w5tj,1,"My life has been so confusing and hard for me for the past many years and I'm not sure what it is. (Something to note I am diagnosed with mild autism)

I've suffered with depression since I was 12, I can remember having suicidal thoughts for awhile, self harmed in class to cry for help. I'm not sure what help I needed or need to this day, all I know is that depression lead to self hatred and anger. I remember when I turned 14, everything, anything tint would light a rage inside of me that I could not dampen
 
I'd be in a car and my mam would say something that would be so meaningless yet it would drive me into such a deep burning angry state that I'd need to clench my fingers into a claw like shape on my knees and imagine violent thoughts to keep it at bay. Even now things make me so angry like my emotions can change so fluently, as I write this I'll misspell something or accidentally delete something too fast and for a second I'll get really angry over something so small. This anger ranges for many things over really anything, I'll become so aggressive angry over anything

This extreme emotional switch does not just apply to anger but all emotions including sadness, happiness ect. 

It all kinda depends on the situation and environment, but I can suddenly start having extreme depressive episodes with constant thoughts about how worthless I am and how I'm unlovable ect.

These can happen for multiple reasons. Maybe I'll read or watch something that I mentally link to my personal life and it causes these emotional swings. Sometimes it's cause something minor has been said that I take too easily to heart and obsess over. But other times, it happens for no reason

For instance I was on a long call with my girlfriend one night (we do it alot and I love her so much she's the only thing that let's me be happy and at peace) but near the end of the call, for some reason I just got this sence that right after the call would end I would die and it'd be the last time I'll see her. I tried to hold it back but once we hung up, sitting on my bed I just began crying begging to not die and how I wanna stay with my girlfriend. It lasted maybe 5 minutes of crying before I snapped out of it and texted my friend for abit which calmed me down. Unfortunately however this is just one of many times where my mind will just plummet me into emotional distress both mentally and physically.

I recall one time rocking back and forth in the dark over something I can't remember but I know it was minor, several times where ill pace around and start to cry unexpectedly and calm down right after, sometimes I've even cried just cause I looked at myself in the mirror.

This has effected me so much in my day to day life, its even the same socially for me too. I've always seen myself as anti social because in general I hate people, just anything about most I hate them for it cause it annoys me so much. Yet there'll be many times where I wanna socialise and ill be so different than usual like ill be active around others and want attention while other times I barely ever look at them like I'm in a mental bubble and if anyone even dares to try and talk to me I'll be sent into a rage.

Why am I like this, why am I so sensitive and change so much. Is it a mental illness? Trauma from my years of depression? Both? I don't know. I'm not expecting any of these questions to be answered, that's not why I'm here. I'm just here to vent I guess and see what others think.

There's so much more to say but I can't even begin to describe it well in a vent post.

If you think I'm an emotionally damage freak, I agree with you cause I feel like I am but I dunno. ",1709822139.0,
ThrowRAhelplls,getting confusing intrusive thoughts about past multiple times a day,1,1b91m3m,1,"i don’t really know how to explain it, but i get some sort of weird intrusive thoughts about my past. it happens a lot and started happening a few months ago, i’ve never experienced anything like it before. it’s not exactly a flashback, i don’t visualize anything. it’ll happen doing seemingly anything randomly, alone, with my boyfriend, watching tv, before i go to sleep… it’s bothering me a lot and preventing me from being in the moment and enjoying whatever i’m doing. it takes away specifically good moments with my boyfriend. i’m finally in a healthy mutually respectful relationship, and these thoughts feel like it’s ruining being in the present every day. he doesn’t know about this. i’ve tried to explain it to my therapist and she is kinda stumped. 

i’m seeing a new holistic psychiatrist tomorrow for multiple reasons, one being i wonder if it’s my medication. 

i’ve for sure been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and adhd. my last psychiatrist was somewhat thinking i have bipolar 2 but my new one is not convinced yet, but she also only talked to me for 20 minutes. i have no idea how to effectively describe this. it doesn’t seem to be triggered by anything, it’s just random. 

i feel like i’m quietly losing my sanity and afraid this will never stop. unfortunately obviously when i’m trying to stop thinking about it or i’m aware of it, it just makes it worse. 

has anyone experienced this? like it’s not a flashback, it feels like my brain is just trying to punish me and remind me of my past, making me think that i don’t deserve how good my life is now and my good relationship. my past isn’t necessarily anything traumatic, my thoughts are mostly about my ex or other people i’ve dated, almost making me feel guilty about having relationships before this. it just feels like a sort of reminder. and it’s taking a toll on me.

RefrigeratorHot64,I don’t know what happened me,1,1b8yy2s,1,"Sorry for first : english is not my core language of life so some sentence is could be hard to understand. 

I’m 28 years old woman born in 1995, south korea. But I’m not sure exactly that is me because some phenomenons are not matched for my background.

I’m adoptee and I’m survival of child abuses. When I was child My parents doesn’t give me food and they didn’t bring me to hospital when I was really sick. I could not educated enough, my life was like hell. 

But something was changed to my life. 

I guess it happened 2015 to 2016. Some  neighbors are call my name very loudly. They said I was forgot my name and identity. But I wasn’t know. 

I’m only graduated high school and I’m survival of child abuse. my life was not stable and my brain wasn’t enough to understand knowledge but after that time people think me I’m smart, and they believe I got so many different information of world.

I was not smart before. I was stupid and I can’t memorize over 4 characters of number before. And I have disorder of social. I had panic disorder and a huge depression. I guess my IQ was under 100.

But after of me is smart than before. I can’t understand what happened to me. I got 120 over scores in wechsler IQ test without training. 

And sometimes I just remember some word of science, medicine and body. But I was not educated about that and I wasn’t understand about them. Without education and training, I got high score in IQ test and remember that strangy word.

I don’t know how it’s possible. And I suspect about people. They said I lost my personality in 2015 to 2016 but I can’t remember about that context. 

I think I’m just same person but many facts are not matched. Who am I? First of all they got a information I lost my identity but I wasn’t know and Second they already think about me that I’m not me.

Now I’m live alone without family and friends. I’m ready to know about that who am I exactly. 
But still I don’t know what happened me because I already searching about myself but my medical record is very clean. 

Summary : I’m 28 years old woman and survival of child abuse. I was stupid and normal before 2015. But after I’m being smart and stable person without therapy and training. I can’t explain how it’s possible but I remember some word outside of my background. 

I guess I have amnesia or dissociative fugue or any dissociative disorders
Is there anyone same person who got same phenomenons like me? Tomorrow I go to hospital for my situation. ",1709829190.0,

,I dont know what's going on with my husband..,2,1b8qeot,7,"I dont understand what is going on with my husband...

I've never posted on here before, looking for some advice, feeling very concerned. So my husband (35) starting about 7 months ago has been telling me very often that he thinks someone is drugging him?  He works from home and barely leaves the house. Yet at least twice a week he will go into a rant about how he isn't feeling well that day and someone is ""chemically altering the way he feels"", I get so confused because I know it's impossible that this is happening.  He has even accused me in the past of drugging him, multiple times, and will say things like, ""its ok if you are, it doesnt even matter, just don't stop doing it"" (wtf??) ...I'm just so confused and concerned, that he has been saying these things over and over again. He was diagnosed with ptsd many years ago, but I dont think that has anything to do with this. Maybe it does? I have no clue. Someone please tell me if you have any advice on what to do, i have no idea how to help him calm down when he starts ranting. Its getting to the point where a whole weekend can be ruined, because hes in a bad mood, and If i ask him whats wrong his answer is almost always the same. That hes being ""chemically altered, and its not in his control"" and then the whole day goes to shit. I also want to add that in general he is a very loving husband. Hes so kind and patient. He makes me feel beautiful, and I know he truly loves me. He's like my best friend. But when he starts talking about being drugged, which has become more and more frequent, I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.

puppudoggu,"Derealization, Dissociation, and Dreams",1,1b8sk1n,0,"For a few years now I've known that I have issues with derealization and dissociation, my last therapist was the first one to actually work with me on it. We made no progress and it got to a point where she said she didn't know how to help me. Its really scary but at the same time its like my feelings are trapped so far down that i either dont show that im scared at all or i just have a full blown meltdown.   


I cant tell whats real sometimes, or ill forget where i am or whats going on. I can forget a conversation i was just having or things i was meant to do in a day. I forget how long my hair is, what i look like, sometimes i even forget what age I am or what house im in. Im losing memories alot. If i do remember something for some reason the memory is really messed up, different colors and different faces, i dont really trust my memories anymore since sometimes when i talk about childhood memories with family they tell me that ""that never happened?"". It gets even worse with my dreams.   


My dreams feel so real that I wake up thinking that me being awake is me dreaming and the dream I had was actually real life. Or Ill wake up thinking I can fly and could always fly, that I live somewhere different, that I spent huge amounts of money, that I'm younger or older, that i had a child or pet that i never had. And the things that typically help others figure out if they're dreaming dont help me. they say to check how many fingers you have, or what time it is, or to simply look up, none of it works. Its always oddly consistent. And the few times ive actually been able to tell if I'm dreaming i cant do anything. I dont get those dream powers people talk about, and it usually takes longer to wake up.   


Ive been having a really hard time lately because i can tell its getting worse. I forget that i have certain family members, or ill think that my name is wrong, or i feel like a stranger. I feel so wrong and disconnected from myself. Like my childhood memories arent mine, like my brain is rotting or something. Ive tried to write to-do lists but i somehow forget to use them or where i put them, even if its in an obvious place. Family can tell me to do something but somehow I forget what im doing when im doing it.   


I dont understand why my memory is so bad, why I cant tell what's real or not. It especially hurts since I know I used to be able to feel connected, to live in the moment, but now I cant, and I'm forgetting what living even feels like. Things dont hurt like they used to, or feel as good or refreshing. If i get hurt like stubbing my toe or getting a paper cut i just dont feel it that much. I just move on. Sleep doesnt hit the way it used to, and time seems to pass very weirdly. Somedays i think im going to wake up 9 years old at my grandparents house, questioning if any of this was real.   


Im sorry for ranting i guess what i really need to know is how to feel alive again, like this is all real, like my body is my own. Im scared but it feels like my body wont let me ask for help. Sometimes when im cooking or drawing my hands somehow move on their own, its scary. I dont know. Im just nervous but so so stuck.,",1709811516.0,

,Goodbye reddit take care!!,5,1b8cigw,3,"Goodbye from reddit guys, I'm deleting my account. I don't want to waste anymore of my time in social media anymore and I would like to make any contribution to anyone who's suffering or is feeling lost right now no matter how small it is. I know it is hard, but listen you have some ways to leave that hole. Here are some tips to anyone who can take advantage of them

1-Exercise, if you're depressed it's not only because of your mind. Altought that idea is pushed a lot, your body and health is a major factor in your happiness. Serotonin and dopamine is what gives you pleasure anyway, all of your feelings depend on the state of your body and exercise gives you the best high feeling achievable in a natural way. Specially running (runner's high).

2-Stop scrolling endlessly, social media is an habit. You only do it because you wired your brain to do it. You probably don't even enjoy it in the same way as a long term healthy habit, instead you probably have short bursts of happiness. Why? Because social media has literally mechanisms to make you addicted. Just like gambling, you scroll looking for that one post that will make you happy and when you get the jackpot after minutes, hours, you do it all over again. Quit that shit, and you'll feel like your days are empty at first but that's good because you then can fill them up with new habits.

3-Dont give into your identity, if you've made depression your identity, you'll stay depressed forever. You need a new set of beliefs that make you a stronger human being and that rewards your efforts. Another note is for the lonely type of people, the worst thing you can do is to think like a loner. Instead, pretend you're sociable. I know that sucks, I've been there. But imagine please with a rational mindset, you wouldn't approach someone who looks like he doesn't want to talk would you? You wouldn't want to talk to that guy who doesn't even look at people. So pretend you're sociable. Pretend at least, that you're not sad or anything like that. It helps, not only to give you another social status but it cheers you up as many psychological studies have found it.

4-Sleep consistently, wake up at around the same time and sleep at around the same time. Just like I said before your physical activity is important. The same goes for giving up your addictions, porn addictions, drugs, bad habits. Those activities rewire your brain. So get rid of them.

I hope that someone gets help from these tips. Good luck to all",1709762245.0,

I had a bad falling out with a friend that resulting in us cutting each other off completely and it’s destroying me. We lived together but I think we became codependent and toxic, long story short it was an awful situation for both of us, but she refuses to take any of the blame. She told me everything was my fault and that I was emotionally abusing her. I’ve thought of every single reason on why this wasn’t true and how she was just trying to hurt me. 

I have to repeat these reasons on why I know she was lying on the daily; from remembering her daily rituals of guilt tripping and using me to remembering that she never once took the blame for anything. ever. 

I know I wasn’t perfect but I know this wasn’t all me. Its a very complex situation. 

Sometimes though, more often than not, I start to think that she was right. Why else would she leave me if I wasn’t awful? There’s voices seeping in telling me I don’t deserve to live if I treated her the way she says I treated her. But I know this isn’t true.

I’ve found myself lost in deep thought of how I could end it. I’ve tried before when I was younger. I tried shortly after everything happened.

Small-Flounder4030,Autism/PTSD. How do you know? ,3,1b85tki,1,"Hello! Last year I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 34 y/o. Startet at meds, and I now mostly feel that I can function at daytime. I feel this diagnosis fits me right. The more I've learned about this diagnosis, the more I see ND's within my family. My mom and sister especially.. My fam dont know I've got a diagnosis. I come from a family who do not believe in mental heath issues. My traits took place from childhood. 

My oldest child is now beeing assessed for ADHD and autism, and most likely will recieve both of them. 

Before I started my ADHD assessment,  I also thought of maybe having ptsd. Bc I have suffered from anxiety since my early 20's. Last year, when I was beeing assesed, my anxiety was gone (bc of antidepressiv, wellbutrin).
Now, I feel anxious at night time before going to sleep. I almost fall asleep; then it feels like im gonna choke and have to sit up. Or it may feels like someone is shaking me. Previously, if I felt really hightened, it could feel like someone touching me. 

I'm so scared of the dark, if I have to sleep alone. My bed is a trigger almost every night. I dont have visual flashbacks. But the way I wake up before falling asleep reminds me of one episode in life. 
 At the age of 17, I experienced one single event in bed.  I totally panicked and my body was shaking all night. 

 I also dated a narcissist 5 years (from 17-22 y/o) and my family were never really supporting me enough.

 I feel most comfy now when I'm alone. I've always suffered from low self esteem my whole adult life. How do you all know the difference of ptsd/cptsd and autism? I've always interrupted people in conversation and always been told I talk to much, speak too loud, walk too fast. My impulsivity has gotten me in so many stupid situations as a child/young adult. I have a hard time feeling safe around someone now and actually trust them. I can feel ALOT, but also go totally numb sometimes. I mask all my traits by beeing quiet, as much as I can. Then I feel so stupid afterwards...

I dont see myself having shutdowns, meltdowns or special interrests. I love beeing social, but my social battery is running out a lot faster now.

ohnearohbearohbear,I think I'm experiencing an episode,2,1b885ip,2,"So I think I'm  experiencing an episode? I was told by a counselor she felt like I had bipolar disorder in the past.  

I can't really tell when the set in or don't. I can acknowledge something late but not when I'm in it. But I think I'm dealing with a manic episode right now? 

I kinda noticed something was weird last night I guess. 
 
I'm a sexual person and have plenty of vanilla, and kind of kinky fantasies about both genders. They come and go, and rarely do I do them in my IRL sex life, or feel like I have to to have an enjoyable experience. I've been this way since my sexuality developed and always felt like I was """"normal"""" (for lack of a better term). 

As of late I've only been able to connect with really violent fantasies that always make me feel dirty, used, or exhausted after I finish touching myself. I don't like it, because typically I'm in a good mood after I self pleasure. 

I also felt this obsessive need to do it over and over again, even though that's not really my style either. Lastnight I went out to go buy something for dinner and just turned back around so I could go home and self pleasure. I wasn't even excited by it like ""oh this is going to feel good,"" or ""oh I'm so horny,"" I just felt this intense need to fo it and it felt uncomfortable.

And suddenly I just felt like the dirtiest, worse person in the world for having kind of kinky fantasies. Like maybe it was a form of self harm (which I've heard some fantasies are), or it was a sign of how truly disgusting I am, that my soul is twisted and ugly or something. 

Normally I feel pretty neutral about my fantasy life. I've read before that it's normal to have fantasies that feel unlike you, or strange, or kind of uncomfortable, and you can just enjoy them without having to feel guilty. So this is whole obsession I have right now is so weird. 

It just seems so important even though in the back of my mind I can tell it's kind of stupid. 

But I still keep feeling worse and worse.

 I woke up this morning feeling weird and tense, like my body was full of wasps or something idk I can't describe it. I felt the need to touch myself again and I did and I felt weird afterwards. I decided I'd get up and go eat. 

I showered feeling weird and anxious. I kept washing myself over and over feeling uneasy.  

I sat down on my bed and tried to figure out how to feel better. I thought maybe I needed to work through my sexual shame? Maybe that's what was driving my bad mood? And when I did I'd feel better, and feel calm? I read articles online about kinky stuff, I looked at porn to try and feel something positive about sex. It sounds random but it felt random I just felt like I had to do something I was being called to some kind of action. 

I got up and got dressed. I talked to my roommate for a time. She was looking at me weird. I think the stuff I mentioned was weird. I talked about a conflict with a friend and how I feel paranoid sometimes. 

I got into my car and drove to go eat something I was so hungry. I just started crying and self harming. I was swervjf in my lane I think. I just wanted to diem I was so sure I was sick and dirty. I thought it would've been best for me to have died in infancy. I just felt so alone and scared and angry and put of control. 

My thoughts were just kind of appearing and disappearing. I couldn't rmebebr why I had started crying or what the problem was I just upset. Everything seemed so huge. 

When the tears dried I went in, ordered and ate. 

I feel calmer now, like I can reflect, but I feel edgey and tense.",1709751959.0,
RuinedTheGoodThings7,Depressed While Sober,1,1b8c086,0,"!TW! SH, MENTAL ILLNESS, SU***DE

I am almost two months clean from coke, which is great for everyone around me. My girlfriend is especially happy to have me back in the house and present throughout our daily lives, but I’ve been suffering nevertheless. 

I don’t think about using very often anymore, since I know it will just amplify my dark thoughts and mindset. 

Throughout my sobriety, I have done things I would have never done while in active addiction. My right arm is a canvas of light and dark scars from any sharp object available to me at the moment. 

I struggle with psychosis often (while sober, and before I even began to take up stims). I feel, see, and hear the presence of creatures watching me in a dark and threatening manner, and it often makes me contemplate the ultimate solution as a means of escape, despite how much it would hurt the people in my life. 

I don’t have enough money for mental health treatment, despite being able to afford a coke problem a couple months ago. This is because I am debilitated by my hallucinations, making working shifts rare and extremely difficult whenever I am okay enough to get out of the house. 

My mind is constantly haunted with thoughts of ending itself, and dark creatures following me anywhere I go. I don’t want to die, but my mind is seeking it out at any opportunity. I barelby sleep, I am haunted, and I am scared. ",1709760982.0,

Also, I get some sarcastic joy from seeing children suffer. I like when they cry. I'm scared one day I'll act on this ""intrusive thought"". It's so real, it distinguishes itself from the other intrusive thoughts.

AdMain7094,Psychosis or Bad high,1,1b87j25,5,"&#x200B;

I have severe anxiety and OCD. I am 23 in grad school. I have no family history of mental illness besides OCD.

I was recently diagnosed with OCD but I have had the tendencies my entire life and this bad high really brought it out and was even hospitalized for it in the past due to the extreme anxiety (unrelated to this story).

So, this happened about 3 months ago right after finals I wanted to relax so I got high, I had to pass drug tests for my co-op, so my tolerance was very low, and I took more than I normally do and I was also high alone in my college apartment which is never the case.

I was playing COD with my buddies online. I took way too much edible (120 mg) and this made me very anxious and also took 200 mg of caffeine of reign. So, then I thought I heard something, and I ripped my headphones off, and it sounded like my neighbors/someone in the hallway, but I was so high that it made it sound like it was in my apartment.

This made me super anxious, because I thought what I was hearing was not real (but in hindight it probably was). Then my friends got off and I stayed on because I was super anxious that I would hear something and I wanted them to stay on because I thought I was going to hallucinate and hear something not real when I took my headphones off. Then when I eventually did take my headphones off I was so tired and anxious.

This led to me hearing what sounded like intelligible conversation and this made me freak out into a panic attack, because I thought I was in psychosis. My tinnitus was so bad (always is when I am high) that I couldn't tell where I was coming from but it sounded like white noise in my apartment. I went to sleep and felt completely normal the next day until I googled schizophrenia symptoms and now, I am very anxious about getting it.


This has made grad school near impossible this semester and I am struggling under the stress of school and this stupid crap I should have never done.

Sorry, that is a lot, but I do not think like that anymore. Do I have any reasons to be concerned at all?? Is this normal? I am sorry, I just wish I never got high, and I am scared I screwed up my mind and my career. Yes, I am **NOT** getting high EVER again.

Once again, my pcp, psych, and therapist are **NOT concerned but I am**. This anxiety has been extreme because I am so scared of schizophrenia.",1709750486.0,
Rosesnlillies,Husband divorced me during mania/psychosis,1,1b86m8o,0,"Hi everyone, just wanted to share my story. I (36F) have known my now ex husband (38M) for 12 years and have been married to him for 6. In the past month he developed a psychosis and I tried everything I could to get him the proper help he needed. He refused and began to see me as his enemy. We were in a happy marriage which is why it came as a complete shock when on the 21st of February he told me in front of his father that he wanted a divorce. He refused to give a reason but when I kept asking he said that the feelings are gone and the trust is gone. I asked him why and if I could do anything to change that he said no my decision is final. I pleaded for him to reconsidered because I did not want him to make such a final decision at a moment where he is mentally unwell. We are Muslims and when a man verbally divorces his wife there is a 3 month reconciliation period where you still live together and can reconcile. After 3 months the divorce is irrevocable. My ex said that I am supposed to live with him in the same house, in different portions and we will keep our distance , but I cannot leave the house and if I don't find any other place to live afterwards, I can rent the lower portion of the house. I freaked out and I packed my most important stuff in a hurry and went to my mother's house. The night after I came to my mother's house, my ex came around at 1.30 and threw in a window. He threw metal rods & wooden planks over the wall and yelled that im a whore. We called the police but didnt file a report yet. I never wanted to leave him, especially not during an illness. there was a lot of love between us. I do think however that he was planning this divorce beforehand because he had the presence of mind to do it in front of his father (a witness is required. ) I excused all this behaviour due to his illness, but he went too far. I talked to his dad recently and his dad kind of blamed me saying I should have stayed at the house and he is advising me to sweep everything under the rug. My ex husband doesnt bother to keep in touch and is going on lavish spending sprees. He hasn't gone to work in over a month. The reason why I think it's bipolar vs any other condition is because one day he feels on top of the world and other days severely depressed.  I have talked to my (ex)husband 3x and he admitted that he remembers everything and is apologetic and said that evil voices in his head were telling him to divorce me and that the voiced said I'm a bad woman and that's why he vandalised the house. He said Satan had tempted him the day he divorced me but that it will never happen again coz he is over that episode now. I said you need treatment and you can't guarantee me that it won't happen again coz it's not in your control. I asked or actually pleaded him to go to the doctor with me and he refused. He said he is open to help but not medication. I think at this point we both realised our marriage was over. The lack of accountability from his side is hurtful. He would rather loose this marriage than get help.  We are supposed to have a call on Saturday but I don't think it's much of a use. I wanted to know, was I wrong to demand he gets help? He has demonstrated that he is capable of physically attacking me. He wants me to come back home and just see how it goes while I want him to consider treatment before I even think of returning.",1709748433.0,

(Trigger Warning)

I'm a 26 year old Australian (M) with a long history of mental health problems. I'm fairly certain I was molested or exposed to sex from a very young age, I had my first somewhat sexual experience with a girl my age when I was about 5 or 6 years old, I'm not sure who instigated that out of the two of us but it was really weird, I'm not sure why I was attempting that so young. I had reoccurring nightmares in childhood of a woman getting uncomfortably close to me but that's about all I can remember, I think my brain did a good job of blocking whatever that was out of my memory. I know that I've always felt uncomfortable when adults would hug/kiss me, I still feel this way, especially with my mother.

I was a sensitive kid and I'm a sensitive adult, I'm very empathetic and have been since I was a kid. I'm a good listener, and I've constantly been told throughout life, ""I don't know what it is about you but I feel like I can talk to you about anything and you don't judge me"" I was a somewhat bright kid, I loved reading, but I struggled with staying focused, and I started suicidal ideation around the age of 10 and going to a catholic school, my thoughts of suicide worried them a lot and I was made to speak with the school nun quite a few times about my problems.

I was bullied in school quite a bit, mostly for being skinny or weird. It probably didn't help that my family moved around a lot during my childhood, so I always had to deal with being the new kid.

My parents weren't by any stretch horrible, but fuck did they invalidate the shit out of me and convinced me that everything I wanted to try, I'd fail at it or not like it ie; Jobs and Education, all while telling me how intelligent they think I am, it has been such a head fuck.  I know they think they have tried their best over the years with me and my siblings, but every member of my family suffer from some form of mental illness so I give them the benefit of the doubt majority of the time, I guess to the detriment of my own wants and needs, I people please a lot, mostly because I feel strong need to be accepted or liked by people. In saying that, I really do wish my parents were open to going to therapy for themselves, I don't think they quite understand how their problems have affected us kids. I don't think that will ever happen, but it's nice to imagine. My mum always played the ""Well I'm just a bad mother card"" and she became an alcoholic after her father died from alcoholism when I was 14 and still drinks today she also smokes pot, but I think that has been the case her whole life. As for Dad, he drinks, but not as much, he smokes weed and has for his whole life as well. Dang if I ever so as criticised my father, I'd end up in a full blown domestic, which happened a lot, quite a lot of police interventions over the years, one so bad that they placed an intervention order on the two of us and I wasn't able to contact him for a year. My Dad grew up without a father and has ADHD, so he was always a fun friend, and not really a supportive father and funnily enough from a young age I played therapist to my dads problems. Over the past couple of years I've started to put two and two together and I'm fairly certain he is vulnerable narcissist. Everyone bar my best friend and partner can't wrap their head around the fact that he was so horrible behind closed doors, it made me so upset to see him be so nice to everyone else in public, only to come home and treat us kids like dirt. He used to tell me and my older brother that he didn't want kids, that he did it for mum, and that their relationship was problem free before us kids came along. I used to look up to my older brother, he was my idol, and he used to treat me like he hated me in childhood and adolescence, nothing I ever did was good enough, I wanted to be like him and he hated it, I wanted to be myself and he thought I was a dickhead.   When I got into high school, I struggled with focusing so much that I lashed out and left class a lot. I started smoking cigarettes, drinking and having sex at 13.

My best friend who I met in grade 6 on the day I moved to the town I'm still in, was raised by heroin/benzo/methamphetamine addicts/dealers, so I spent a lot of time surrounded by a lot of addicts, I wasn't too fazed by it, there was some scary moments, but given that I wasn't judgemental and was curious, I often had conversations with some pretty bad people who shared a lot with me, from everyday people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time, to people who had been in and out of jail for murder and drug offences, even talking to those people at times I still empathised with them as fucked as that sounds. Years later I would see some of my school mates there. I empathised with my mate, he often dealt with neglect because of their addictions and I wanted to be there for him through those times. He wasn't a good friend to me over the years, and still isn't most of the time.

By the age of 12 I was I was already deeply depressed and anxious, I began laughing off problems and my peers seemed to get kick out of that, I guess that's when the people pleasing began and the bullying stopped. By age 14 I was recreationally smoking pot with my friends along with parties and drinking, my parents weren't happy about it but they allowed it under the shitty advice of their doctor at the time. By age 15 I was smoking pot with my parents, they supplied it to me along with supporting my addiction to cigarettes although occasionally they would cut the supply randomly, and treated me like shit when I my withdrawals kicked in.

(Trigger Warning)

This is where the shit really hit the fan.

At the end of year 10 at the age of 15 I was friends with a couple dudes who I considered best friends at the time, they had met some people on Xbox Live. They decided to come to town and we met them and they seemed cool, we smoked pot and drank to together. A few months later my mates asked me to come along to go see them in their town so off we went. For the first day we just hung out and smoked pot and drank a little. That night the two guys that we visited invited a couple of girl mates around, I was told that one of the girls was single and that I should cuddle up to her, I was very promiscuous at this point so I didn't really question that too much. I wasn't actually too keen on this girl, I felt weird and uncomfortable to begin with upon meeting her. Thy put a movie on and this girl kind of had her way with me I guess. The next day, after waking up my mate from out of town came into the room and franticly told us to get dressed and that we all had to leave the house, that this girls boyfriend was going to run through the house if we were there. We went to a park and hid for a little bit, with the girl who now suddenly had a boyfriend. After a while, a car pulled up on the street, and out came this 19 year old guy and his friend, full sprinting at us with a knife in his hand. We all scattered and he caught up to me and the other friend from this town, in between us a car. He screamed at us saying which one is (My name) whilst we ran around this car to avoid him. We both lied and said it wasn't me so he ran back towards the others whilst we ran for it, in the suburbs of this city, until we got back to my mates house, the relief I felt when getting to the front door, thinking I was safe. Right as we went to step foot in his house my friend got a phone call from this guy, saying bring (My name) back right now, that he just wanted to talk and if I didn't come back he was going to start stabbing the others. I practically begged my friend not to make me go back but he wasn't having it, so we walked back to this park, and as soon as I got over to the group of them, before I could even get a word out, he started to beat the shit out of me, knife in hand. I cried, begged and pleaded, hid behind my friends to get away, didn't fight back, and he just kept getting me to the ground, stomping and kicking at me all whilst he was telling me that I was going to die. It went on for ages, to the point that his friend actually stopped him and said I'd had enough. But he wasn't done, he then picked me up, marched me back to the house we were staying at, and told me I was going to give him everything I had, all while holding this knife to my neck. We were almost back to the house, when he got a phone call, some of his mates were coming to get him. He then proceed to make me lay down on the middle of the road and kiss his feet, only to stomp the back of my head into the asphalt. The car pulled up, a car load of people, and he got in and left. My parents made the 6 hour drive to come get me as soon as I called them about it.

I was home for about two weeks, with a good friend going to score some pot at night when a car full of people stalked us, cornered us in an alleyway and robbed us.

After of this happened I was fucked up, I'm still fucked up, I still have nightmares and trouble sleeping, difficulty trusting other people and even myself.

I was put on seroquel, which completely fucked my schooling, I dropped out of year 11. I had friends who got a kick out of making me walk home at night after smoking pot, making me walk the streets alone and sending me on goose chases because they seemed to think it was hilarious that I was freaking out so much about it. One of those being my still current best friend, another who I considered a best friend.

I had a girlfriend at the time, who I was absolutely in love with, who had to deal with my post trauma trust issues and irritability, I loved her so much, she dealt with me venting a lot, about my trauma and my drug addicted best mate. I had to break up with her because I couldn't put her through the bullshit anymore, I did it for her own mental health, and also my own, I had to learn to navigate it on my own. The only way I could get her to accept the break up was to tell her I didn't love her, an absolute lie.

The friend I considered a best friend, who was there for me the day I got back from the assault  was dealing with a heroin addiction that I was unaware of for some time and substance abuse with a lot of different drugs, I along with our friend group started experimenting with LSD and other drugs from the silk road, even some shifty research chemicals. He was a very very intelligent guy, mildly narcisstic,  but he was very good at pretending everything was fine, he rarely talked about his feelings. His ex partner and myself are among the only people he knew that he took his mask off for. He came over one day and admitted to using heroin and admitted he'd used a few hours before coming over. I got angry and told him to leave. That was the last time I ever saw him. We spoke a couple times over the next couple years and I was apologetic for pushing him away, told him that I'd always be there for him, and 6 months later he was dead. Overdosed. I'd already had a few friends die to suicide at that point, but when he died I truly broke.

Fast forward to 8 months ago, another really fucking good mate of mine died from an overdose of script opioids. He had moved away years before that to ""Get away from the drugs""  and get his life together, none of us knew his addiction got worse there. So it was a real shock to us. I became more depressed than I'd even been in my life, I couldn't leave my bed for weeks.

We had a gathering a couple of weeks after his passing, at an old older friends house that we used to party at, it was sort of a halfway home for a lot of us in our teenage years. We discussed a lot of things, we got onto the topic of my ex, who till this day, is with an acquaintance of mine. I was then told that the first mate who overdosed, had actually gone and fucked my ex right after we broke up. This guy who I mourned over for years, cleaned his grave monthly, felt guilt over, backstabbed me. My ex knowing how much I loved him, worried every night over, went to him and fucked him, I don't know how to feel about it anymore, I'm so confused.

All of this has completely fucked my progress in life, I can't hold jobs, I'm pretty much constantly analysing people, and myself. I've started studying so many times and dropped out.  I still have major trust issues and paranoia, on my own I've learnt to internalise this instead of project it. I suffer with substance abuse problems still. I'm faced with years of therapy that I can't afford, a ten session mental health care plan just doesn't cut it when I'm going to probably need hundreds of sessions to reverse this. Those first ten sessions could quite easily and more than likely will be used up on my ""History"" because I have so much of it. I honestly feel like I will never feel joy or pleasure in my life, I'll always be haunted by nightmares, that my life is doomed to be a constant uphill battle.

I'm sorry for the trauma dump, I understand that the internet is a pretty silly place to vent, but I don't really have great support in my life at the moment. The only reason I'm still here is because of my partner. She's so patient with me, and loving towards me despite all of the negatives. She just struggles with communication, but I know she loves me very much, even if I don't love myself.

My mother has been mentally ill my entire life, suffering from bipolar, OCD, CPTSD, manic depression, anxiety, the whole nine. 

Historically she's always been able to come out of her manic states.

For a while after my brother and I graduated and grew up. She handled herself relatively well despite not being medicated. 

Fast forward to now, our grandmother (her mother) passed away almost four years ago. Since then something just kind of ""snapped"" she started having significantly more manic periods and less rational thoughts. Started driving everyone away (myself included) I've avoided going over for the last few years for one reason or another. She still refused to seek treatment of any kind beyond her medical card. 

Fast forward a few months later and she has become completely detached from any reality.

EERMA,"When the Body Says No, Gabor Mate. Book Review.",2,1b7dgix,0,"**What is the book about?**

This is Gabors’ attempt to lay out the long-term wellbeing effects of chronic stress – much of it arising from our earliest experiences including deficiencies in the childhood / primary caregiver relationship.

**What are the books’ key messages?**

The inextricable linkages between brain, mind, body, soul, and the environment(s) in which we live our life. Each of these five essential elements interact with all the others – problems with one will increase the likelihood of maladies in one or more of the others.

Humankind has known this through the ages. Modern medicine lost sight of this through its awe of the pharmaceutical model in the second half of the last century. It is now relearning this fundamental truth through the lens of the scientific method via psychoneuroimmunology.

Because chronic stress is both so prevalent and malevolent, it is a recurring theme as a contributory factor in a wide range of auto-immune and inflammation-based maladies. Gabor presents many case histories – more than are necessary – to illustrate this central theme.

**Gabors’ ‘Seven A’s of Healing’**

Gabor concludes the book with his ‘Seven A’s of healing’. While this feels like it is tacked on to the end, it offers a worthwhile model for reducing the negative elements of the complex matrices which determine our likelihoods for various chronic conditions. Here is my take:

· Acceptance – the willingness to accept how things have been, how they are and the connections between past and present. I would add that the present, heavily influenced by the past, does not have to equal the future – we have capacity to influence our own life’s trajectory. While Gabor does not say this directly, I often think in terms of two truths: (1) my childhood was not my fault and (2) my adulthood is my responsibility.

· Awareness – routinely tuning in to our emotions and reflecting on the ‘why’ of our present emotions. Self-awareness sits within a core concept of personal development. It leads in to a sequence of imagination, conscience and free will as a route to developing the fundamental concept of agency.

· Anger – Often viewed negatively in our society, anger has served a key evolutionary role as an emotion telling us we – or what we value - has been violated in some way. The response prepares us to restore that imbalance, with force if needed. Gabor presents convincing evidence that suppressed anger is a key factor in increasing the likelihood of a wide range of maladies. Within the Solution Focused Hypnotherapy model, anger is one of the three primitive opt-out clauses (anxiety and depression being the other two.) Inappropriately expressed, or not expressed, anger can add to the stress bucket. Unchecked, a vicious cycle can unfold.

· Autonomy – establishing and enforcing our own personal boundaries. When we don’t know what is us and ours, we don’t know what to develop and what to defend; where we end and where others or our environment start.

· Attachment – our connections with the world. With our primary caregivers in childhood and ever-widening as we grow through life’s transition from dependence as children to independence as adolescents and young adults to interdependence as mature adults. Deficiencies with attachment early in life ripple through our lives. This sits at the heart f Gabors latest book ‘The Myth of Normal.’

· Assertion – our declaration to ourselves and the world that we exist, and that we are who we are: that we exist on our own terms. This allies closely with authenticity: understanding your signature strengths, values, beliefs, and sense of identity. Working with these issues is intrinsic to the PERMA(H) wellbeing model.

· Affirmation – the act of making a positive statement of our sincerity in moving towards a positive outcome. Affirmations is a subject I have written about elsewhere and is a key feature of developing abilities with self-hypnosis. 

**What are its weak-spots?**

An overly heavy reliance on anecdotal case studies which jump from one to the next with little continuity. I found myself skipping through sections to get to the substantive points being made. The seven A’s model would have formed an effective structure, with each element given its own chapter, discussion, and case histories to elaborate.

It was written in 2003 – so much more has been learned since then that a modern primer would be a next step to achieving a good grounding in psychoneuroimmunology.

**How will it impact my practice with Solution Focused Hypnotherapy?** 

Within the Solution Focused Hypnotherapy (SFH) model, we use the ‘stress bucket’ as a metaphor for chronic stress. By helping clients manage their stress bucket, with a view to lowering it, we can have a positive impact on this significant element of a complex matrix. This shifts the equilibrium between the limbic system and the neo-cortex (for convenience we refer to these as the primitive and intellectual minds respectively). In turn, this impacts on our thought action repertoire which I have written about in other articles. This is core to the SFH model. Notably, a client who had already recognised the link between their stress and eczema. A stressful period would be followed by an eczema flare-up a few weeks later. With an emptier ‘stress bucket’ the flare-ups reduced in frequency and severity.

While SFH acknowledges the influence of the past on the present, its focus is on building the future we choose for ourselves. A basic tenet is ‘the past does not have to equal the future.’ Our futures are not pre-ordained, based on our pasts. We have varying degrees of capacity to influence the future.  Our role as therapists is to support clients in recognising and developing their capacity to build their chosen futures. The academic studies refer to large populations and determine the relative likelihoods of various outcomes e.g. among a population who smoke to an equivalent extent, those who are carrying high levels of suppressed anger are more likely to develop lung cancer than those who don’t. This says little about any individuals’ personal likelihoods of outcomes. It does however, underline the need to understand our personal risk factors and take steps to push the odds in our favour. The PERMA(H) model is an ideal general model which can be adapted to serve an individuals’ needs.

So, in summary, ‘When the Body Says No’ will not engender any significant changes in my SFH practice. It does, however have some useful supporting content. I will almost certainly refer to it when working with clients who are carrying chronic physical conditions.

**Who would benefit from reading this book?**

This book would serve anyone looking for a quick read introduction to psychoneuroimmunology. A more recent primer would be needed to give an overall picture. ‘The Myth of Normal’ would be my go-to recommendation. ‘When the Body Says No’ isn’t a bad book: it could serve as a good starting point for someone exploring the mind / body / brain / soul / environment (holistic) approach to wellbeing.

I just really want to know what’s wrong with me. 

During my sophomore year things started to change for the worse, I was failing all my classes, feeling exhausted all day, couldn’t sleep and would go to sleep at 3-4am and wake up at 5:30 am every morning, would barley consume anything all day besides my daily energy drink that didn’t help at all, and started developing a complete disregard for my grades and overall future. I also had been self harming (cutting) since freshman year. 

My mom withdrew me from school due to my bad grades and extremely bad attendance saying that she’d switch me to this online school but instead she put it off for months while I sat isolated at home with no reason to ever leave my house since I had no school and no friends I was close enough with to hang out with (I had a best friend before leaving school but her dad forbid her from seeing me after she told him, her cousin, her grandma, and reported me to the school about my cutting after promising she can keep it to herself.) 

After a while I was enrolled in an online school. that almost catches the story up to the present and I can’t say things have gotten better, the school was the type where you do the work on your own time and pace with the rule that if you are inactive for some time you will be unenrolled. I’d put off the work for days and spend 95% of my time everyday in my room in my bed doing nothing but sleeping and using the internet, until my work was very late and I felt this overwhelming dread when I even thought about opening my laptop to see I’ve been unenrolled so I decided I was just gonna let them unenroll me and when my mom notices she’ll enroll me again and I can try to do better.  

My mom ended up not saying anything about it. after a few months I was sure that she must know, I was confused about why she hasn’t asked about my school but i didn’t wanna bring it up to her because I didn’t wanna hear how upset she’d be about it. 

I’m now at a point where I feel hopeless about life and can’t see a future for myself. I’ve always tried my best to hide how I’ve been feeling from my mom because I don’t want her to feel like a bad parent or cause her emotional distress and I don’t want my family to see me differently, but I’ve started to find it suspicious that she hasn’t noticed anything considering I’ve obviously been struggling in school for some reason, I’m awake all night and then sleep for an excessive amount through the entire day every day, my room is constantly messy and filled with trash everywhere sometimes to the point that you can’t see the floor, I often go weeks without brushing my teeth or showering and I feel so dirty and disgusting but I just can’t bring myself to do everyday things. 

I hate most things about myself and don’t think I contribute anything to society and would likely be better off dead but I don’t wanna hurt or traumatize my family, lately I’ve been thinking that maybe it’d be okay for me to just be selfish and end things so I don’t have to continue on like this 
 
Sometime after I left school I got a new best friend and she means so much to me for being there and being my friend, I really don’t wanna to let my problems make me  grow apart from her like my best friend from before. But it’s so hard for me to pull myself together and interact with even my own family, I’ve found myself preferring to be alone since socializing is so tiring.
I’ve also started smoking an excessive amount of weed, I guess I’ve been on a weed bender for the last 3 weeks being high almost completely nonstop. I also tried acid a few weeks ago which is something I would have never even considered in the past, I realized that drugs make you feel better until they don’t.

I also posted this in r/mentalhealth with not much interaction so far, thank you for reading.

throwawayanonymousB,Why did I do these things as a child?,5,1b6ou8l,8,"As I have grown into adulthood, I have started to realise some of the things I done when I was a child is extremely strange and actually very embarrassing. I have no idea why I ever done them or whether there’s a deeper meaning to it.

My dad was a cocaine addict and alcoholic, he wouldn’t do this stuff everyday but he would regularly disappear for days at a time and my mum would drag me in the car with her while she went from pub to pub hunting for him. When he did get home high and drunk, he would be very abusive towards my mum, I don’t remember very much from my childhood but I remember them having very explosive argument, where my dad would punch things, things would be thrown around, they would push each other out the house and my mum would regularly have to bring me and my siblings to our Nan’s house or her friends house just to hide from my dad because she was scared about how he would be. I often also found myself trying to break up their arguments and physically getting in-between them when I was below the age of 10. There’s a lot of other things he would do but my memory is very vague and I really don’t remember a lot.

There’s are a couple main things I remember doing as a child and I wonder if these are somewhat related, these are also very embarrassing for me to share. I used to wet the bed up until I was around 17/18, I tried every way possible to stop this and multiple doctors visits but it wasn’t until I was around 17 that I finally stopped, I also remember when I first started my period, I would hide my used pads under the floor boards which I realise Joe doesn’t make sense considering my parents knew I had started my period and we also had a bin in the bathroom. My parents later found the big stash of used pads and confronted me about it. I also remember when I went to my friends house and I needed to poop, if when I flushed the toilet, it didn’t go down, I used to hide it around their bathroom, I have no idea why I don’t this because I would surely know that someone would find this, is there a reason I done stuff like this as a child? Is this all a trauma response?",1709592704.0,

gratefulcloudyday,Should I drop my college classes,1,1b6yoc9,0,"I F19 go to community college. I recently switched my major to nursing as I was no longer interested in pursuing a long term degree in psych. I have a lot on my plate and I'm wondering if dropping my anatomy and asl class is the answer. 

First, my mom is emotionally abusive and toxic. She has had episodes lately of abusing me and taking money from me, which has not felt good. She has also put me to work around the house with deadlines (ex. you cant do said activity if you dont clean x by today) which has not been great for my studying. This has been my biggest barrier to studying for a large load class like anatomy. I had to reschedule a test because she was causing me great emotional distress. 

On top of that, I work full time at a shelter for abused children. My parents require independency from me, meaning I pay rent to them and pay back my car. I also pay for my own groceries. Im thankful they pay for my phone but I think they get it cheaper with a family plan. But my work has been very rude to me lately, calling me into the supervisor office for mistakes I have not made, such as not knowing my location for an hour (I was upstairs supervising sleeping children) and trying to blame me. 

I try to invest myself in activities I enjoy like coaching a sport on the side twice a year for 2 and a half months. But before this season starts, I was talked to for bad reviews last season from parents. Seeing on the paper ""coach was mean"" ""not helpful"" ""too loud"" made me lose faith that I am good at my passion.

I feel criticized in every area of my life, and it doesnt feel good as a person with bipolar 2 and bpd. My dad is deployed right now until fall and I miss him. I've been having health issues like reoccuring yeast infections since last August and yet-to-be-treated sleep apnea. My boyfriend keeps me happy, but I feel that I am going through too much to handle. I feel so depressed and helpless.

Should I drop my classes until I get things sorted? I cant move out, I don't make enough money.

bordelinealcoholic,Need advice/opinion,2,1b6sl5i,2,"Hi everyone. I'm a 23 yr old female. A few years ago I was diagnosed with MDD, GAD, insomnia, and some mood disorder. It was my first time talking to a professional about my mental health. I got put on Seroquil and Prozac. At the time, those did wonders for me. I stopped going bc life happened, and it was too expensive. I feel like I missed a lot, or didn't mention a lot. I also started noticing things that might be possible ""symptoms"" or something. 

I'll try to explain what I feel might be ""symptoms"", and if anyone could put their input, or something sounds familiar, it'd really help. So i have drastic mood changes. My highs are very high, and lows are very low. I'm super motivated and hopeful one day, the next I'm dreading my life. I can be super confident and love myself. Then I can doubt myself and hate how I look and everything about me. Things bring my mood down or up so quickly. Certain things trigger me, and I start to get super anxious. 

At times I want to be around and talk to people, other times I will stay inside for days isolating myself. I don't trust anyone. I always feel like people are against me. I feel that my bf is doing something behind my back. Certain days it will bring me down so much, other days I just don't care. What happens, happens. Or it can stress me out to the point where I'm sick all day. I want to trust people, but I just can't force myself.

At times I feel like my entire mindset is changed. I feel at peace, I feel feminine and beautiful, I think ""wait, maybe I didn't actually care about this or that. It was just my anxiety or something"". Then the next day or a few days later, all that goes away and I'm fearful, depressed, I care too much again. Sometimes these periods last longer. Then I hear my bf say he sees a change in me. Or I'm acting different. 

Sometimes I feel paranoid about the world ending and me going to hell. Or I feel like something is going to happen to me. Kidnapping or car wreck. It stresses me out. I can almost see it happening in my mind and I feel it physically. Like I have to shake the feeling off. I do this a lot. I keep thinking about terrible things that could happen, physically cringe, shake it off. Try to forget. Sometimes what I picture is very graphic, and now I fear that this or that will happen. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy. As if I'm trapped in this body, this life or house. I feel so overwhelmed w negative emotion. It makes me want to do something stupid at times, or drink alcohol. At times I'm so at peace I'm a whole new person. I'm glowing. At times I look at myself, and everything around me. And I feel as if I'm not alive. Wondering where I am.

when i attempt to recall anything from ages 7-10 theres only a few memories of just being bullied at school and constantly having anxiety. and when i try and think of anything from ages 0-6 i just have about 2-3 short mwmories from kindergarten, and 1 memory from a really religious school i only lasted a couple of days in as i was really afraid of everything there. other than that everything in my memory is black or too blurry to differentiate between memory and imagination

i really want to try remembering things from.when i was younger as theres been a lot of weird things going on with me that i cant explain???? one of them which i probably hate most is the feeling that someone is really close to me behind me, with their hands all over my body in a way i really hate and feel gross just thinking sbiut. sometimes itll go on for ages out of nowhere and other times it happens whenever anyone is close to me or touches me at all even if they arent doing anything wrong. it feels so gross to me and makes me want to just cry and stab myself often as i feel like thats the only way i could feel clean. im not sure if i carw about getting rid of the feeling at the moment but what i really want to do is find a way to remember something thatll allow me to know why im feeling like this. i feel like i dont have any reason for what makes me feel like shit or overwhelmed at all as i cant remember anything that would cause this.

Parking_Wolf_4159,Is it not common to try benzodiazepines with psych patients even if they've been hospitalized inpatient for psych issues related to anxiety? When did the trend start to be resistant to try them with a patient where severe anxiety is one of the main issues?,0,1b6r9pa,1,"Hi. I was diagnosed with severe OCD/Anxiety about a decade ago during an inpatient stay at a mental hospital after a breakdown. When I was there, I was put on an anti-psychotic (Risperdal) and then when I was discharged I was put on Lexapro. The medications sort of helped, but I would still have breakthrough cases of severe panic attacks where my body and brain could not calm down. Never once was it suggested to me to try benzos. I know they have a bad reputation, but I am not somebody who does drugs recreationally at all, nor have I ever had the desire to.

My inpatient stay at the hospital I believe mentions severe anxiety/panic issues (It was a severe panic attack that led to my inpatient stay), yet it was never suggested or offered to me. I was only ever put on SSRIs or atypical anti-psychotics like Risperdal/Abilify. Looking back, even with the risks benzos have, I feel taking them in cases where I truly couldn't calm down would have helped me. Is there a reason psychiatrists/people in psychiatry don't suggest them, even when the patient has no history of drug usage or addictive behavior, like me?

I am no longer on any psych meds, but I still have panic attacks from time to time where it takes a lot out of me to be able to calm down, and it usually ruins my entire day mentally and physically. I'm just wondering if at least trying benzos would have been reasonable in my situation. I understand fully that long-term usage is dangerous, I meant to take them in situations where the benefits outweighed the risks, such as in cases of severe panic.",1709598670.0,

Just-Ring-1427,Someone please help me out for my current situation with my brother.,1,1b6mp4q,1,"My brother who is in his early 20s recently had a mental psychotic outbreak and has been in and out of a few different mental facilities. It all started a few months ago when he was at college and then decided for himself without telling my mom or I that he just wanted to go off 20 mg of Lexapro cold turkey.

Then one weekend he fled to a different part of the country on a one way flight to fullfill this ""dream"" of his to go camping and being on his own. He came back and that was definitely a red flag but then after that he ran away from home again and then my mom called the cops on him.

&#x200B;

He has been cycled through numerous different SSRI's without much success and now recently he was moved to a different state with ""better treatment"" but this doesn't seem the case because he has been there for a month now with no success and he just seems like a zombie. It is very sad to see my brother like this and he threatens my mom he will harm himself if she doesn't pick him up out of the mental facility, but we don't trust his mental health to even get him out of there.

I have never suspected him to be gay or have homosexual thoughts but now all of a sudden too he wants to paint his nails and make a career out of drag.

Hi. I am a mid twenty something year old individual living with multiple disabilities (neurological and medical in nature) My doctors tell me on a disability scale, I am moderately functioning (I can walk and talk and I’m not blind or deaf, but some tasks like learning are hard for me). I can also disclose my disabilities if anyone wants more specific info. 

Just to be clear the reason I don’t want myy parents to control my life is because I like to be an independent person (which is why it’s very hard for my self esteem to have disabilities). I actually do love my parents. I don’t fully understand what they are allowed (or not allowed) to do if I have disabilities. I’m not opposed to getting some help from either the government and or my parents, but I don’t want them to have to have power of attorney or a conservatorship or something like that. Having my parents watch my money is also a hard thing for me because i want to be independent. it's not that i think they are going to steal it. This again is hard for me because i do love my parents but i also want to be independent. 

With that being said, I am wondering if I HAVE TO let my parents have some control over my life (like as a disabled person, am I legally required). I don’t want them to. However they are trying to get me enrolled in certain government support services. I am currently working part time remotely. However my parents want to enroll me in DDS and DES, and they said that I am only allowed to have under $2,000 in my bank account. I don’t like this. I am an adult and I want to be able to control my own life (including my finances). I am wondering if they are able to get me into a conservatorship or power of attorney even though I’m over the age of 18. I also don’t want to be forced to live in a group home. My parents were able to talk to DES and DDS without me even having to talk to those offices myself first, which I find really strange given my age. I don’t want either of those things. I am not a child (though my parents say that I am living under their house and I need to follow their rules). My mom also doesn’t think I will be able to hold down a job (even though I currently have one even if it’s part time). I guess what I am
