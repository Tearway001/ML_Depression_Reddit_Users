SQLwitch,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",2365,doqwow,177,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",1572360722.0,moderator
SQLwitch,"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis",13,1bq9t74,57,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",1711667719.0,moderator

Shoddy_Crow583,4chan destroyed my life. I am racist loser who struggles going outside.,61,1c69btu,22,"I'm writing this text because I really can't help myself anymore. I am 22 now and I just watch my life go by. I never had a real relationship, no friends and I am really depressed. The only thing I have left in my life is university and a part-time job at a big IT company to make some money. I am about to get my bachelor's degree and am already working on my thesis. I am studying CS (sorry guys for making your prejudices true) at a major college and rationally I would have a very bright future. A well-paying job and a decent living are in sight, but some days I cannot even get out of bed.

Why is that? I am addicted to 4chan's pol. I personally don't realize how much time I spend there every day. The hate there is addictive, you can't get enough of it. The first time I was active there was in 2018, at the height of Trump's administration. For a while I tried to quit, but I just can't. The damage and hate the site has done to me is just not curable. I feel very uncomfortable going outside because whenever I see non-white people, I just get a bad feeling.

They have made me a disgusting racist. Whenever I see interracial couples, I get very disgusted, whenever I see black children and white mothers, I get disgusted. My inner self tells me I am not like that. I have to leave 4chan. But how? I tell myself every day: This is the last time you'll visit the site, and suddenly a click - and I'm right back where I started. Posting BS about minorities, Muslims, and non-white people.

I'd love to join the gym, but my 4chan side tells me not to: You will not like the minorities there! Something is wrong with me. I am also a stranger to my family. I barely talk to them. I need to get my life together. Maybe I will have a career, but personally I am a wreck. Even going to the supermarket is a struggle. I have become a sociopath. I talk to myself very often because I have nobody to talk to.

I am a racist. I am a loser. I am a disgusting loser.

What would you do if you were in my situation? How can I change?",1713359097.0,
irrelevantname133,I’m ready to kill myself,28,1c6ddrl,29,"32f

It took years to come to the point where I am comfortable with the idea. I know exactly how and where I’ll do it. I just have nothing left. My family never loved me, which caused me develop into an awkward and weird person. I used to love my daddy, remember him coming home every night and getting so excited I’d fling myself out of bed every night to hug him. 

My mom and dad divorced when I was around 4, I was heartbroken and thought my mom was so mean for getting rid of him. I didn’t cope well. Anyway, he ended up being a deadbeat who didn’t give a shit about his daughters. One time, he even compared us, and said my sister was better looking. I was fat then lol, lucky me I was the less attractive daughter I guess! :) 

My mom stopped hugging me when I was 5-6, and I didn’t understand why. She blamed me constantly for things, and tore me down when I was already low. My passions and interests were annoying to her.

I have developmental issues (ADHD) that went untreated and no one tried to help, so I dropped out of high school. By the time I was a teenager, I was so extremely antisocial that I lost connection with everyone. I only learned how to read and fear people, how to stay off their radars to protect myself. I erected walls around my heart and mind.

 At this point, I self-sabotage any relationship that could possibly be good out of fear I’m going to be rejected, my standards for friendship and love are so high they belong in a novel, because no one will ever be enough for me. And I know I’m not enough for anyone either.

The last crutch I had just crumbled underneath me. I have literally nothing to live for anymore, other than my animals and one other person.  

I’m probably going to do it soon if I can’t find another crutch. I’m barely coping with this life. 

All I wanted to was to know the unconditional love of one human who could see the good in me despite my problems. But the world is no one’s paradise, and I’m too weak to make my own. This place is tough.",1713369188.0,
Broad_Whereas_8254,Suicide Tonight,98,1c5yu2q,55,"I have made a decision tonight to commit suicide. I had stopped my meds a while ago and gained a new perspective and found Allah. Now I fear I may burn for this transgression but I'm willing to risk to stop living with who I am right now. I have learned that I could possibly have scoliosis and have no intention of dying a slow and painful death from a degenerative spinal disorder. My posture and body are all uneven and I have tried to improve my posture but to no avail. I have had a history of self harm and attempted suicide and this is yet another hurdle in a life I never wanted to live in the first place. I have come to peace with what I need to do and If I do not do it tonight it will happen as soon as I can. I may be weak and lazy but when I barely have enough energy to get out of bed I cannot do the exercises I need to stem the tide of this condition. I sound extremely lazy but I cannot physically make myself do anything anymore. I have also wondered what is in the great beyond and if it is damnation I will face the flames with more hope than I ever experienced on this plane.

And that’s not just it! I also messaged my grandma sorry for being a shit person, she said she is used to it. These are the only two people I have in my life, and even they are done with me.


I just can’t exist anymore. I’ve fully given up on life after 10 years of severe depression, Every ounce of effort I’ve put in has been for nothing. Nothing has gotten better. Everything I’ve done has gone wrong. wish I’d killed myself back then.

Now I don’t trust therapists and the mental health system. The psych hospital was truly a nightmare and some of the workers there were just evil. I know that sounds like not realistic, but seriously. They play mind games and twist your words and use them against you, to try and keep you there longer.

FutureBatman1,I made my suicide date?,52,1c62557,12,"I put NSFW just for a trigger warning.


I made my suicide date without thinking I was in a euphoric state the other day and kept whispering to myself “I’m going to end it” then I just said a date June 27th and I can’t get it out of my head. I feel so free? I like auto memorized the date I didn’t need to write it down. I just keep thinking about the date and when I do I feel so free and happy. 
I’m feel so alone. I’m also an addict lol. Forgot to add that. I smoke nicotine every day and weed every other day. Sometimes I do acid,heroine,opioids,cocaine it all depends if I can get it or if I have money. When my peers talk about the future I just sit and smile thinking about the date. I’ve been depressed for so long and felt so alone and now I’m going to be free. Like it’s making me happier now that I have a date when all my pain will go away. I can’t wait for the 27th I feel so happy and good about it. Nothing really feels real I just feel like I’m watching myself like out of my body? I’m so scared everyone’s going to leave. I am so risky because I simply don’t care what happens to me anymore? Like I’ll hop fences and dangle off of the edge of a 100ft cliff and feel so happy and free.

TimmyFabulous,My depressed older brother wasted 8 years of his life and I made it worse,21,1c64ju2,2,"My brother and I are 6 years apart, he is currently 26, and I am 20. My earliest memory of seeing his struggle was us sitting next to each other cross-legged when I saw lines on his forearms. I wondered what those lines were, they were deep and purple. I asked, and he nervously laughed. I wanted to see them but he refused. I know what they are now. Self-harm, with knives. Another memory is when I would get pocket money I would always try and save it as a kid. But sometimes, he would come and ask for it. I didn't want to give it. He pressured me, I knew what he was going to use it for. Drugs. I didn't give it and refused to give it. Another memory is whenever we would go on family trips like on the road or outside near the end he would always ask us to leave. Pressure us, and start to get agitated, antsy. I resented him for it. He would ruin these trips - he always asked us not to take him but we didn't wanna just leave him. But I see why now. Drug withdrawals. His room was always filthy. Not dirty but messy. My mom would keep asking him to clean it and he said he would and never did. My mom would end up cleaning it. I resented him for this. Can't even clean his room. My poor old mom had to step in. How useless can he be? But I understand it a bit better now. Depression.  
I remember him always being rageful when someone made light of depression. When people say they get depressed because of 'wintertime' or 'lockdown in COVID-19'. His blood would boil. I remember we had a deep talk once and he said it to my face that he would be jealous of me sometimes. I was the golden child of the family, the youngest (at the time, we have a younger sister now), perfect grades, top of the class, president of school stuff, got into the top universities, sports team captain etc etc. He never wished bad for me, but said he was jealous at how well things went for me. Because everything in his life seemed to go wrong. We discussed more then he looked at me deadpan and said '8 years'. He said he wasted 8 years of his life in a bed. He ruined everything for himself. From age 17 to 25 he did nothing. He said dark thoughts that he started having since 14 just took over him. But then i remember him also saying something special about me. Someone asked each of us what it would feel like if the other vanished. I said something pretty lame at 15 years old, I said there wouldn't be any fun stuff haha. He said it would feel like the light was gone. I didn't get it. I get it now. My family shielded me from this dark reality because of the trajectory I was on but my parents knew about his situation. He says he doesn't feel joy anymore really, everything is just a pastime. He does the drugs so days feel shorter. He said he'd never commit suicide but doesn't see the point in the world. Its existence and his.  
I've tussled with the problem of not knowing if my brother is a good person who does bad things or a bad person who does good things. I've thought, and thought, and thought. There are inexcusable things he has done. Like the time we set up a birthday dinner for him and he ruined it with his bad attitude which soiled the mood. It infuriated me. He doesn't like birthday stuff cause it feels fake but dude just enjoy the birthday. But then I see some of his good character. How he is so protective of our younger sister, making sure she's always safe and mindful of things as she grows up. I've thought so much.  
But me and my brother have an amazing relationship right now. As we have had for the last couple of years. We do everything together, we have same hobbies and all. Its awesome. It's been rocky but that's how it goes. We're inseparable and ride or die. He's done super well for himself to get himself out of that hole. He helps a lot around the house, has explicitly said he's trying to get off drugs, works in a factory, and is trying to find something else to do as well. Getting his driver's license to help my dad. But he still has those dark thoughts. Hes not 'well' yet. He still has a lot of issues. But I never apologized. I never explicitly said sorry. I said so many things over the years to him, cursing him, about how shitty he was, useless, because of how i interpreted the things he did. I think it still haunts him. I pushed him further into the hole. Do i tell him I'm sorry? How do I lift him up and drag him along to some success? I dont wan't him to lose to his thoughts. I want to see my brother doing well for himself. I need you guys on r/depression to help. Please. I don't know how to. I'm just, so sorry.",1713342125.0,

i don't see why anyone should care about me, because i feel nothing at all ever. i don't think i'm a great friend or person, and i'm never really myself around anyone. i somehow do care about my family but i don't think they'd care about the real me. i guess most of my problems stem from knowing how much shit i would get if i were living as me. i just fit the boxes society expects of me and carry on and it kills me on the inside every single day. i don't want to be fake, but being the real me is dangerous.

i hate how much i don't really, *really* like anyone. like i wish i felt pure unadulterated affection for someone but i just feel empty and like...a bad person because i don't return the love people feel for me. i just can't feel it. or maybe i can't afford to get attached because everything will hurt more. people have always disappointed me, and i don't want to internalise what they say at all. i need to be as aloof as possible but being aloof is exhausting in its own way.

anyway, i just. feel alone all the time and it's tiring because no one ever sees me and i can't let them see me either. it's just a constant loop of getting up, doing the things i have to, coming back, doing the things i have to, and just hating everything, haha.

i hope someday i feel truly happy but i have no idea how that could possibly happen. it doesn't seem likely in this lifetime but...yeah.",1713370045.0,

ActiveAmbitious6686,I am not a good person,2,1c6fc9n,1,"Throughout my life I have spent most of my time coasting through life, not taking anything seriously and most stuff that I am good at just came naturally to me, I don’t work for it. I have been so blessed in my life with overwhelming support from my family. I could do whatever I wanted (within reason) as long as I maintained good grades in school. Instead of working for those grades, I would do anything to get good grades, cheat, lie, take advantage of nice people to get the answers etc. In college I was a leach, I latched onto a few friends who carried me through school. I benefitted from covid-19 online schooling and allowed cheat sheets for exams. All so I could obtain a degree that would look so good and flashy to other people, I thought I was the greatest. I sacrificed a lot of relationships to be able to obtain this degree, it made me miserable working for this, but I thought hey it will just get better at work, not at all.

Now that I’m in the real world I’m realizing what a terrible person I am. I started off wanting to be this greater worker do anything for the company, work my ass off for something and do it. I felt like the smartest guy like I knew everything right when I started working there. But after awhile I realized I know nothing. I quickly got burnt out, I thought if something was wrong or off it was my fault or a mistake that I made. Instead of just asking the question and now if anything gets remotely hard I fold like a lawn chair. I don’t ask the appropriate questions in fear of looking dumb and I act like I know everything when I really don’t. The work I’m putting out is terrible and my mindset is terrible when trying to learn. I don’t take teaching/coaching well, it feels like when someone is teaching me something I’m either 1.) too good or know it already or 2.) feel it is a strike at my ego because I don’t know it. I have this weird comparing myself to other people attitude because I am so insecure about myself. I’m overly self aware to my surroundings and how people view me. When just talking to people at work they just give me this blank stare like why tf did we hire this guy. I’ve never been the greatest communicator I fall back on dirty jokes, belittling myself and sports for topics of conversation. In the real world, you can’t talk the way that I do and find comfort in talking about. Which is hard for me to understand and cope with. I never realized how entitled I am until I started this job and realize I have made no personal connections with people. I expect this to be like school where I get gratification in the sense of obtaining a grade for something. But not getting that grade back, getting that high of seeing a good score or seeing that shit score and knowing I need to buckle down has been a tough adjustment. 

I am realizing that I have serious issues that I need to work on and I have started to go to counseling to help mitigate some of my problems, however I feel like I’m just going in there complaining and not taking any actual action. I have had some dark thoughts about life and I have gone to some dark mental places since starting this job. I know people are going to read this and think what an entitled pos, and you are completely right. I have a supportive family, friends and girlfriend, but I can’t pull myself out of this. I just need some guidance on what I can do to get out of this. What are some things that you have done that have gotten you to a place where you feel comfortable in yourself and changed the things you didn’t like about yourself.

I haven’t told anyone how I feel - not even my therapist. I find it so shameful and embarrassing to be so unlovable when so many people effortlessly have loads of family and friends who consistently show up for them.

I have intrusive thoughts about scenarios such as dying alone and having no one at my funeral, or being terminally ill and people not wanting to visit me. It terrifies me and makes me so so sad.

My main problem is how much I hate myself. It runs so deep, it's so heavily ingrained into who I am as a person, to the point where I don't even notice it. It's all just automatic. I only notice when others point it out to me. 

I exclusively only speak about myself in a negative way. Without thinking I will put others needs in front of my own, not because I'm such a nice person, but because my needs don't matter. It never occurs to me that I matter at all.

I get really anxious about what other people might think of me. I can't cope with the idea that someone might think I'm a bad person, ugly, annoying, anything really. Despite this I will actively seek out evidence to confirm that other people don't like me. I'm very self destructive and self sabotaging in my behaviours. 

It's not always pure self hatred, most of the time it's just that I don't care about myself at all. I look after myself to an acceptable standard when it comes to showering and self care and stuff.

I'm 18 and in my first year of uni. I have friends and I go to most of my lectures and am doing well academically but I only have one close friend in uni and I pretty much tell her how I feel because then she'll be one more person who's implicated in my hopeless depressive spiral. At the start of uni I put myself out there, went to societies but I never really found good friends. I'm going to therapy but I really don't see what good it's doing. I spend so much time alone in my room and I used to drink to get through it. I don't shower a lot because I can't muster up the energy. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to, everything is just a bunch of stuff that happens and requires effort. I've been feeling very tired for a while like I need to sleep for 6 months to like fully reset myself. Last year I was more vivacious still a little shy but I made lots of new friends and there were a lot of things in my life like my friends and school that I enjoyed doing they didn't feel like chores or work and I was happy and I had a best friend. But now I feel like everything's such a big ask and things will just keep getting worse and worse as they have done over the course of this year. 

I feel like I need more than a therapist I need someone to tell me what to do what to say who to talk to who not to talk to, what to wear, how to do my hair. Because either I'm doing it all wrong or the odds were stacked against me from the start of this year and there was no way I could've done it right.

pt92_01,I'm (31M) obsessed with best friend (28M) from 15 years ago and it's made me depressed that whole time - should I end it or try to make the best of it?,1,1c6g7pk,0,"Let me take you back to 2009. I was 16 and had no real friends through my teenage years. Through church I became friends with a guy three years younger than me. Let's call him Mike. Over that year we spent a lot of our time together and became best friends. I had been very depressed and lonely before this and was just so happy to have a real friend.  
  
After about a year, Mike began to want to spend more time with other friends too. Which of course makes total sense ... but me being a lonely and immature 17 year old took this as rejection. And I started to become obsessed. Any spare time I had I was wondering what he was doing right at that moment. Who h e would be hanging out with and having fun without me? I guess I just had really intense FOMO. We were still very close friends, but when I wasn't around him I was always pining for him.  
  
After another 4 years or so (2015), my mental health problems and general negative attitude led to Mike ghosting me completely. This was a horrible time for me. It took about a year before I really functioned again properly. And I was back to having zero friends, and being very depressed and lonely. But gradually I stopped thinking about him so much.  
Then three years later (2018) he reached out to me, and we began to again hang out on a very sporadic basis (like 3 or 4 times a year). While this was awesome, it also revived all those feelings of pining for him, and just feeling not satisfied with the amount of time we spent together and wanting a closer relationship again.  
  
We've continued on this basis ever since. I now see him once or twice a year at most. And then we only meet for about an hour for a coffee or something. And it's just so hard, because after all these years he's still my only friend, and I feel like I just want a much closer relationship, and it makes me so sad that it isn't like that and there's seemingly nothing I can do about it. Mike is now married but I know he still has other friends he sees more than me. So I'm always feeling a bit put out, and wondering if he really even likes me anymore or just meets me because he sort of pities me.  
  
So my question is ... what on earth should I do here? After all these years, the feelings of longing for a closer friendship are clearly not going to go away. Would it be better to cease contact altogether and try to forget about him? I'm not even sure if it's possible but the feelings of pining are so intense I don't know how to live with it.  
  
\---  
  
Some further info. I'm asexual so I've always been single and am always likely to be, which obviously doesn't help with loneliness. I've never been able to make other friends - for some reason I just don't click with people. I suspect I may be on the spectrum but really bot sure. It may sound like I'm in love with Mike. And like, maybe I am? I don't know what love feels like? My pining is very specifically for him and not just for friendship in general.",1713375928.0,

YuNi-xYn,A note to myself along the journey fighting with MDD.,3,1c67jn2,0,"
I remembered the times when I was enduring things on my own, keeping it to myself and thinking things will be better and I hope everyone, everything will be better in the future. I remembered that everything seems hopeful that I was looking forward to the future and hope that I will be happy and everyone around me will be happy that my feelings don’t matter as long as everyone is happy and I could get over it by just have a night sleep. I remembered the time where I saw hope and I was so eager to create the future. And I was coping just fine.

But, I slowly lose control, losing the momentum of my life, losing interest in things, losing the ability to control my temper, starting to hurt people around me, yet I have never realized that I was hurting people around me, and always thought it was other people’s fault for not being understanding.

In the end, I realized it was actually my fault, where I failed to realize that I was actually so useless and small and I simply do not have the capability to do what I wanted. I have failed miserably and I was devoured by the darkness. I thought I was very much needed and I was the fire to light up a path for the others. But, I have failed to realize that I was just the wick of a candle, that burn myself and there are no wax around me. It was just a useless effort because I am nobody. 

A wick can’t light up without the aid of wax. And I thought I have found my wax but I failed to realize that I was also burning the wax around me, hurting them and do no good to myself as well.

Now that I am just ashes on a piece of white paper, making troubles for people to rub it clean, to rub the dirt off the paper but it contaminates the paper even more. I am very sorry to my families, having to endure my endless breakdown, my friends who tried to help but didn’t know what to do, and my loved one for sacrificing herself to endure with my stupid temper and stupid illness.

I wanted to end this, but apparently god has other plan for me. I failed to die and ended up bringing much more misery to my families and my friends. I do not know what to do. I have tried whatever advice was given and yet none of them works. I can totally understand where no one is willing to take care of a bomb which will explode any time soon as the ricochet hurts so much for them to try to contain this time bomb.

I am tired, I am really tired. Death is not an option as I can see lights from far apart, yet I have no capability to reach for the light. I hate seeing my friends worried about me, I hate seeing my families worried about me, it was me who was always concerning the others, it shouldn’t have be people who are concerning about me.

People told me everything will be fine. I told myself that as well. But the relapse after relapse really is killing me. I’m ill. I need help. But no one could help me but myself. Which I am very aware of. I never felt so hopeless before. They say time could heal everything, but the reality is the doctor told me that my serotonin receptor failed to work properly and they didn’t know how bad was the damage, and the only thing I can do is to rely on meds, which the meds will work overtime and they can’t promise when will the relapse happen again.

They ask me not to worry about the relapse, just be at the moment, to heal and recover myself first. It’s been more than a month where I am completely useless and fucked. Nearly a month on meds and I see no improvement aside from my appetite which swings from time to time instead of having none at all.

I am tired, I am really really tired. Having break downs from time to time, even when I was playing games. They told me to go outside but I have fear going out and I don’t know when will I cry when I go out, and a few of my friends literally has to deal with me and look at me like I was some sort of ghost when I was crying.

Panic attacks after panic attacks. I am simply tired. I am fucking tired, I am literally so tired. I want my normal self back, fuck this illness. I would rather have cancer than this stupid things that make me look like an infant. Even infant can feel happiness and I can’t even feel happiness. I am a fucking burden now. Help me. I am really tired. I want a rest, forever.

If ECT helps, I am willing to do it. I am done trying. My willpower simply isn’t strong enough as I finally admit that I am fucking weak. Please, let me go back to normal life. I just want to work, social with friends, and being able to control other aspects of my life. I just want to regain control…

Yet, there’s things I was fortunate of as some people in my life decided to move on with their life to seek for happiness, not needing to endure my toxicity. But I was very sad at the same time as my families who have no control of leaving me and let me rot. They are here to suffer with me, and I used to thought I was able to carry the whole household alone so my father can retire and I was very wrong about that, and I am truly  sorry that I let all of you down. I don’t mind if any of you wanting to leave my life. Please do so as I might hurt you in the future and I do not wish that to happen. I love you all, and even though you guys wanted to leave me, I still love you all. Nothing is wrong or right. It’s okay, everything will be just fine. It’s my own journey to walk. It’s okay if you guys simply do not want to deal with this piece of time bomb.

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don’t know where it goes
But it’s home to me so I walk alone.

I want to leave this place because it is so depressing, I'm currently going to the psychologist to see if I have ADHD, depression, or both. My dad lives in Costa Rica so I know both Spanish and English which gives a lot of opportunities in Costa Rica I'm planning to go back and maybe go to the university, but my mom talked with me (she lives with me here in the USA along with my older siblings and my little sibling) she told me that I'm young and that I should use my options as a young person who knows English to find a good job here, and that I should have the balls and think thoroughly but what I think is that the only options I have are to work in a McDonalds for the rest of my life, my dad also used to be very abusive and he would hit me hard for getting bad notes on school, which might be because of ADHD (that's one of the reasons I'm going to the psychologist). But I've seen him kind of change which kind of influences me to go back. Costa Rica is a green place full of life compared to the USA. Yes, I know that the USA has many good sides, but the bad sides are so bad for example the health insurance and also that I want to keep studying but I can't because I'm illegal.so if I go back to Costa Rica I can't come back to the States for probably 7-10 years which means I won't see my little sister, my older siblings, and nephews in a long time.

I'm feeling like a loser. I don't know the exact reason for feeling this pathetic right now. I've been feeling this way for god knows how long. I'm failing every exam I take.

Whenever I try to escape, it pulls me back in even deeper than before. I'm mentally exhausted at this point. 

How long will I have to keep fighting? At this point, I have no energy left. It seems like good things are not even made for me. I'm losing all connections with my friends.

*You:* Well, lately I’ve just realized how futile life is. We’re all just going to die in the end, and once you grow up and realize that there’s no afterlife you realize that the best thing you have to look forward to is the complete absence of anything. Some believe this is a positive, because it means we can live our lives how we want to without worry about some silly heaven or Hell. But unfortunately, we still have to live with the consequences of our actions for years or decades. And pain is common and easy to come by, while pleasure is uncommon and fleeting. And you really can’t choose your own path in life because you’re under the control of corrupt old men in suits who get to dictate your life from a thousand miles away while robbing you blind. And if you don’t play their game you can expect to end up pretty miserable, if not outright killed. 

At this point I just wish I was never born, especially since I’ve realized how delusional and unstable my parents are. They never should’ve even gotten married, let alone brought kids into this world for their own selfish desires. Plus I’m stuck in a perpetually decaying meat suit that requires constant upkeep just to feel halfway decent. Which isn’t easy considering how expensive healthy food is and how we’re swimming in a toxic sludge at all times. I also have several serious chronic health issues that will likely never go away which require constant doctor visits and a cocktail of overpriced pills every single day. And this is not unusual, as even young people are becoming more ridden with illness and cancer. 

On top of being trapped in this fragile little body, I’m also stuck on a decaying planet that’s becoming more and more filled with gases and chemicals and radiation and microplastics. There’s also the fact that I’m surrounded by vain and selfish androids who could manipulate me and lie to me just as easily as they could beat me to death. The more time I spend around people, the less I like them, and the more complicated by life gets, and the more alienated and alone I feel. I’ve realized that humans are the worst possible combination of intelligence and animal instinct. This is the same species that has tortured, raped, and murdered hundreds of trillions of other living beings for their own benefit, which I am also a part of against my will. Even without humans, nature is cruel and unforgiving. 

I’ve tried nearly everything to improve my life, including diet, exercise, therapy, medication, religion, etc. and nothing has really changed things at all. I wish I could just die a quick and painless death, but I’m not allowed to do that either. Life is constant suffering, it’s pointless, and the false hope we give ourselves over and over is the worst kind of torture as we rot in an endless cycle of unimaginable horror.

My dad was amidst his alcoholism when he raised me and passed his abusive trauma down to me. Now here we are where the cycle repeats itself. I’m one of the worst boyfriends towards my baby mama and I can’t stop no matter how much I hate it or want it to stop, I don’t stop treating her like shit. Not to say she doesn’t play her part when we argue and fight but she doesn’t deserve this. Our child she’s carrying DEFINITELY does NOT deserve this. I cannot fathom passing down my trauma to my son. I swore to myself I would end the cycle of abuse and my child would know love and only love.

I pretty much cry all day every day, any chance I am alone I find myself bursting into uncontrollable tears for hours. I don't see my future full of happiness and excitment anymore, but worry and fear. Pain and suffering. I am a normal weight, I don't smoke and I have drastically changed my diet. But I still don't feel in control. I don't want to put my friends and family through this misery.

My doctor has put me on meds but they don't seem to work. I am less anxious about normal day to day stuff but the HS looming cloud lives on. I go to thearpy too.



What can I do?

Anyways back to me complaining lmao I started college in 2018/2019 it’s 2024, I’m 24 broke, there are no jobs in this truckstop/ retirement town and i’ve applied to over 20 places even in bigger cities just so i can feel something,  be productive. I feel so useless especially living back home, my room is an office cause i can’t afford my own place. oh and to add on I  still haven’t finished college mainly cause one of my loans “disappeared” although it was in my account & accepted. so i can’t even finish the 8 classes I have left to just finish this shit OH and get this, my major is Psychology😭 I chose this major cause i liked the class freshmen year but now I hate it. I hate the field, I can’t stand the mental health hospitals, they’re trying ofc but they basically teach you to lie about how you feel regardless or you’ll stay there, and it’s just worse on your mental health. I used to want to be an artist, a psychiatrist, anything creative and helpful really. I wanted to make rehab centers a little more healing man. I used to not be this bitter or tired even when things were bad in the past I’d remain positive and still try to make the best of things, i’d smile all the time but now i don’t want to feel this pain anymore. idk if it’s because my frontal lobe is developing but this life that i’m living sucks man. I am grateful for my parents even after all we’ve been through, I almost committed on a bridge after a man  raped me but a stranger named Jesus held & talked me out of it, Yes that was my ooooh my God, Jesus IS my savior moment but like I said I drove myself insane after that.

When we moved here I thought it was gonna help me become happier but I have only become more unhappy with myself and my life. Im currently in my junior year of high school and I’m now “homeschooled”(all online), i wasn’t “homeschooled” before i have always been to public school but my mom wanted to try something different so she put me and my two little sisters into “homeschooling” they seem to me doing fine and usually have no issue with school but I am now months behind and have no motivation to even begin doing it again. I don’t plan on going to college and I don’t need a high school diploma for my career and yet my mom refuses to let me drop out even though I don’t need her permission i don’t want to blatantly disrespect her and dropout. I don’t want to say school is the main reason i’m unhappy because it’s not but it is part of the issue because as a result of my “homeschooling” i don’t know anyone here and i lost  all contact with my friends from TN, so i have no support system because all of my family here is very closed off and old school with their ways of thinking. I have a tendency to bottle up my emotions and like tonight let them out all at once, quietly. The biggest reason I have feel like I have become more and more unhappy with my life is because my mom moved me, my stepdad, her, and my two little sisters into a camper/rv. It is very small and there is no privacy. the only thing separating me from everyone else is a blanket. I have brought up the fact that I dislike the living situation but my mom keeps saying it will get better because we will get a bigger one and we’re gonna travel and do all of this amazing stuff, but i know how she is and anything she has said will never happen. I have had a lot of things happen in the past two years, I have tried drugs and they have helped me out a lot with being able to tolerate everything going on and i have thought about purposefully overdosing many times and have planned to do it many times. I cannot go to a therapist and obviously have no one to talk to so I always feel very alone which doesn’t help.

IcyRelationship9916,"Depression, Health Anxiety and now on the path to a serious diagnosis…",1,1c6di0a,0,"I’ve had depression since I was 16. Went untreated until I was 25 and I found that talk therapy helps. Every time I speak with a new therapist I’m constantly offered medication but I turn them down because I am NOT ready to take them, scared of the side effects and don’t want anything else to mess up with my body more than I’m already doing.

Last year I started suffering from a plethora of symptoms that are now pointing to a possible diagnosis of a rather serious and chronic condition. On top of all this, I have TERRIBLE health anxiety that I carry with me since I was 12.

I’ve completely shut down. Hypersomnia, routine thrown away, can’t get enough motivation to go to the gym. I can barely make it to work. If my sweet boyfriend didn’t take care of me, I wouldn’t be eating. Lost interest in everything I used to do. Now every little thing reminds me of the effort it takes to complete because I’ve been physically sick for so long that I don’t even want to experience it again. 

I’m trying to tackle this from two standpoints, the mental aspect of it and the medical one for my continued symptoms. But everything is stuck or moves incredibly slow. 

I’m feeling really defeated. I reached out to some friends for help because that’s the best I can do. But of course everyone has their own struggles and schedule and no one is (rightfully so!) dropping their things to help me schedule with a therapist. 

And medical stuff is tough because I have to call and schedule and it’s weeks or months out and nothing ever changes and I’m stuck.

I guess I just wanted to rant. It’s very very hard. I’ve had depression for so long I thought I’d developed strategies to cope when down periods rear their heads up. But this time it is all so crushing because I can’t even fall back on my physical health which has always helped me by means of getting out and work out, cook, do stuff. But now I’m constantly dizzy, my ears ring, my vision is damaged and doing simple tasks has become scary. 

My heart breaks and I’m thinking a lot about ending things.

SNthirteen,I can't keep going on,1,1c6ac0b,2,"I (20M) don't really know where to start. I've been told from the age of 12 by professionals that I struggle with depression, and it has definitely been present for years, alongside occasional suicidal thoughts. However, I'd like to specifically talk about my current situation.

I'm currently in university. I never wanted to be here. Coming out of high school, I really didn't take interest in any career path, nor did I feel like I had the guidance to make an important decision on what to do with my life. Seeing as I was very successful in school and that I had no other alternatives in mind, my parents told me college was the go-to option, and to pick a major. I followed their direction and went with my favorite subject from high school - computer science. I knew it would be difficult, but I also knew I had the ability to do it.

I'm currently in my 2nd year at university, and much of what I'm about to discuss applies to my first year, but things have gotten so much worse since then. I have immense social anxiety, and have not made a single close friend. Most of my friendships from high school have drifted apart from me, and the few that I've retained would respond with ""damn"" if I described how I feel. I'm lonely and have nobody to talk to, yet my anxiety rejects the idea of doing something about it.

My academic situation is breaking me. I'm taking two very difficult math classes that aren't meant to be taken together alongside 4 other classes, all because of a course choice I made in high school before I even knew my career path, which screwed up my university course plan. I should be working hard, yet all I feel, no matter how much effort I put in, is constant pressure, alongside the apathy I have towards this career.

So I do everything in my power to escape. I frequently miss assignments. My grades are plummeting. I've stopped learning even basic content. And it just keeps getting worse as the feedback loop of procrastination puts more pressure on me. I don't know how I'm going to make it through. 

I wish I could reach out to my parents for help, but I have a dad who thinks it's as easy as ""getting your shit together"" and not being lazy, and a mom whose advice is ""have you invested in a tutor?"" or ""have you used the university's resources for these classes?"" I'm too anxious to tell them I want to make a change since they've helped me pay off tuition and are sensitive about money, and that they'd just get mad at me for not putting effort in.

And now it's affecting my everyday life. I'm typing this post as I lie in my horribly unmade bed beside a bunch of trash, dishes, and clothes. I refuse to let myself get up as I have nothing to look forward to during the day besides more stress and pressure. I'm seeing stars from how little I've been eating, and I'm very dehydrated. All of these behaviors would've horrified me prior to university, but I've become so numb to them. It's just how I live now.

I've had thoughts lately of ending it all. There's not much reason to keep going if I have nobody or don't feel driven to do something with my life. But I also feel numb towards everything, which is at least keeping me here for now.

I could go much more in-depth, but I feel like I've summarized everything enough to hopefully get some input. This is my first time really discussing any of this in-depth with anyone. ",1713361665.0,

Throwaway943758,My life is great...,3,1c642u5,0,"I don't know. I think I've had depression for about a year now. I only realized it a month ago from a depression talk school teachers had with us because I always thought ""well my life is so great, and I'm still happy half of the time"", and I had a depressive friend who was sometimes getting bullied by her classmates and getting yelled at from her parents while my classmates are mainly fine and my parents are angels. Idk I felt ashamed of myself for even feeling sad. 

It's weird, I just came from a PE class ROFL sooo much I feel like I could cry of laughter, and now I'm thinking ""My grandma just died and I'm not too sad about it but I'm still sad, my friends don't really care about me, I never have anyone to talk to, my only friend now goes around telling me to 'fuck off' because he got bored of me or though I had a crush on him or wtvr, I just flunked my music grades which I've based my happiness on, my parents only love me because they don't know who I am"" and I'm just so defeated. 

And I'm not even that sad about it, I just feel numb, a constant feeling of dread. I wish I could go back to the days where I cried a lot or wtvr because this feeling is sooo much worse. I would usually cry if I got bad grades because it was the only thing that really mattered to me because I thought that everything else was out of my control, and now I'm just numb. Too many things to be sad about, I don't want to think about it. 

And no one understands me. They see me cry in class and think to themselves that I'm a bratty little bitch for whining about getting a below-average grade, they see me sometimes dropping suicidal ideals and think to themselves that I'm in my emo phase and trying to be edgy. I know this because I trust in my judgement and my emotional intelligence.

I still smile a lot on most days. I want to die but I've never really done anything about it because I know how much my parents care about her and her health. She's such a sweet child, I don't want to take away her from them. If I kill myself then she'll die too and they'll be sad and I don't want to wish that on them. So I won't ever try to kill myself no matter how much I want to. And I'm on a journey of self improvement and learning stuff, trying to be more productive and getting better at public speaking, but I still feel so dreadful. 

I just feel so alone and depressed. But I'm a privileged kid in a good private school with good parents, why am I feeling this way? I don't deserve to feel sad. But I do.

I'm so stupid honestly

Keyes_Jacob_Captain_,Helping a loved one get through life,1,1c6aacw,0,"Hi all,  


this post is not about me but about a very close friend of mine. She is going through a lot of shit right now and im scared that I am going to lose her. I try to stay with her almost all the time possible and at times I do feel like she's gonna be okay. But I wont lie, life hasnt been fair to her. shes going through multiple hardships back to back and it has been taking a toll on her. I really want to share in on her problems and tackle it together with her. She is my best friend and a very very important part of my life and I want her there for a long time in the future as well. sometimes we have talks for hours and I let her open up without any judgement. and in those talks she tells me how easy it would be if she just offs herself. she told me all the ways shes thought of ending her life and I listened to them putting up a strong face (I am very sensitive so I cry on the spot) and tried to add humor to it (nothing serious, just to lighten the mood). and lately I feel like she's shutting herself off of everyone. we used to tell each other everything and I feel like her bottling up all those thoughts and emotions in her head is not going to be great. Her first best friend died of suicide and 2 years later her second best friend died of heart attack and ever since then things have been going downhill. the only thing that has been halting her from offing is religion. She is the reason why im connected with my spiritual side again. and right now shes slowly losing her faith as well. I dont want her to go. I wanna help her but I dont want to overburden her or pressurize her. I do reaffirm her that I am not going anywhere. yes sometimes It does hurt to know that what you're trying isn't reaching the other person. but I will never let her go. our friendship is that special for me. She is constantly in my prayers. I really wanna help her out. She has tried therapy but unfortunately didnt work. I dont wanna force her into anything but I really hope she seeks professional help. do you guys have any suggestions on how I can be help her out?

-misery-loves-me-,Is this all there is for me?,1,1c6a773,0,"Hi. I've never made a post like this before in my life, and this is a throwaway account. This is going to be lengthy, so maybe a TL;DR is in order?

  
TL;DR: I feel like a mistake and have been thinking very extensively about ending my life. I know I won't go through with it, but the relief I feel at the thought of death is really something. I am lying to almost everyone I know about graduating college and doing well because I am a prideful coward. I'm secretly still in school but failing ... again. I finally got a job making decent enough money and getting useful experience but want to quit before orientation because I think I'll suck at it and that it will be too much (I know this is foolish). I have dreams and aspirations but I quash them more and more every day because I set myself up time and time again. I find little no joy in life and have very few things to actually look forward to.

  
I'm not even sure where to start. My life sucks. I feel paralyzed almost because I can't accomplish anything. My 23rd birthday is next month, and I feel like a failure. I realized last year that I have almost always been depressed and bordering suicidal since childhood; the anxiety has always been there though. I've lied to nearly everyone in my life because I'm so ashamed deep down. I was supposed to graduate college last spring with a bachelors degree, but that got postponed. I had to do a medical withdrawal in the winter of 2021 due to voluntary hospitalization for SI. Prior to that, my grandmother died in September (we weren't very close, and I regret it quite often. I hate seeing pictures of her sometimes because we look so alike) and the two people who I thought were my best friends abandoned me in November. (I still have so much love for them despite the circumstances. I wish them the best, and I think of them often, but I doubt they think about me.) December, I took a ""sabbatical"". 

  
I can't remember, but I think my grades were slipping before that semester. I was kicked out of my university's honors college and lost all of my scholarships (still had some financial aid from grants) at some point. I didn't have a full ride or anything, but I definitely would have graduated with like a fifth of the debt and no private loans. The spring after that, I failed maybe one class; that summer, I failed everything I took in an attempt to get aid back or meet credit hour requirements or something. Fall 2022 was good for the most part; grades weren't perfect, but they were passing, and that was an improvement. 

  
I don't remember spring of 2023; I think I failed a physics lab that semester because I didn't do the work. Part of it was from not understanding and being too prideful to ask for help (I had already dropped the accompanying lecture and couldn't academically afford dropping the lab); the other half because I couldn't bring myself to do the work until it hit me that I had fucked up again, but it was too late by that point. That summer, I took the lecture and passed but failed the lab once again. This time, it was purely from procrastinating. I understood the material enough then to stay later and even help other students, something I hadn't been able to do in years. That month, I was so exhausted. Overall, last summer, I took seven classes to compensate for my lack of credit hours; included in the seven was my capstone/senior project. Aside from the physics courses, I had all As -- things were really starting to look up and seem feasible. It was right after the physics courses that I was also finally referred to my university's office of disability services, but I don't think it has made an impact, positive or negative. Regardless, I just had to make it until December for graduation.

  
The success from the summer followed into the fall ... up to a point. In October, I purchased my graduation garb because hell yeah, I'm going to that ceremony. That same day, my mother and I went and purchased my graduation gifts: a gold bracelet with a cluster of emeralds and diamonds and a gold ring with an emerald with diamond halo. I had been wanting the bracelet for months and only got the ring because there was a good sale, and it felt like killing two birds with one stone: my university's colors are green, and my birthstone is emerald. I have only worn them once and then tucked them away at the bottom of my jewelry box because I feel sick to my stomach looking at them. I lived on campus (still in my honors dorm - every semester I was waiting for them to force me into another building, but they never did), but the only classes I was absolutely physically required to be on campus were on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and I'd go home every chance I got. I was at home more than my dorm last semester. I did okay except for the one class I took that was absolutely required for my degree and the class I subsequently almost failed because of it (A > D); I didn't do the final paper for the one class I actually looked forward to every week because I was trying to rectify half of a semester's (extremely time sensitive) work in one week. 

  
Before that, though, I wondered often if I would be allowed to even attend the ceremony. A lot of times, I would only be reminded of the fact I was so close to graduating when my roommate/lab partner would say something about it while trying to make conversation. (I wasn't close to any of my roommates except for my freshman year, but that was probably because we slept across from each other every night. The second dorm I ever lived in had private bedrooms with a shared suite bathroom and living area.) When people would ask about my degree, I would say things that were honestly the truth (graduating if they let me, wanting it to be over as soon as possible, we'll see come December, etc.), but I think everyone thought it was a joke, which worked well enough. I told those close to me exactly what day and time and place the ceremony would be held. I put on the silly little outfit that morning and rode to the auditorium with one of my friends. No one stopped me. No one said anything. No one told me I couldn't walk across the stage. So, I did with my parents and two cousins there (it was originally supposed to be way more people, but maybe I'm glad it was just the four). I was waiting for them to refuse me my diploma cover, to stop me before getting on the stage -- no one did. I honestly started to think it was real, that I had done enough to just barely pass that class. My university contracts some company to take photos of the ceremony, and they send you mailers and emails with the proofs asking you to purchase. Based on past experience, when you fail a course, you get an email sent to you saying so. I never got that email.

  
I would learn weeks later that I, in fact, did not graduate. I failed the required course -- what a surprise. I only found out days before the spring semester would start, and in the moment, I decided to register for the class again on the Sunday night before Monday classes started. I didn't tell anyone except those who absolutely needed to know. I still haven't told anyone. I was lucky in the fact that both times the course allowed for in-person, online, and/or asynchronous participation as long as you met deadlines (that makes it sound like there were consequences; there weren't); this may have also been extremely unlucky as I tend to do better when I am forced to attend, and I know this too. Based on everything else in this post, I'm sure you can guess where this is going. Classes 'end' this Friday, and next week is finals, followed by spring commencement. 

  
I had to pay out of pocket this semester because I couldn't ask anyone to co-sign a loan. The loans offered to me that wouldn't require a cosigner were not enough to cover all of the expenses. The financial aid office allowed me to set up a two time payment plan, at around $680 per payment. There was a one-time plan activation fee that I paid for from my checking account, bringing my balance to a whopping seventeen cents. My mother was kind enough to give me cash to deposit in the event my account service fee came out or something else, bringing it to like $40.17.  I got a credit card in January because I was under the impression that I would and could get a job, keep up the ""I graduated!"" act. I hoped that the limit would be enough to squeeze both payments on there in case I didn't have a job: it wasn't. The first payment was scheduled in February, the second in March. I got email reminders the day before each of the payments, but it also happened the first one aligned with President's Day. Before I could add the new card, I received an email saying the automatic payment was retrieved ... from my savings account. I remember that morning very, very well. I was sobbing in my bed, nearly throwing up and screaming. This was quite possibly the strongest emotional response I have had in years, and I'm starting to cry now thinking about it. I texted my mom to come to my room (I was very lucky she was even home; she takes care of my grandmother with Alzheimer's 24/7, but she was in a respite stay. She was admitted to hospice the day after this semester started. I don't know why I didn't mention this sooner as I also help with her as often as I can), and she sat on my bed as I bawled, saying stuff like ""I fucked up"" and ""I need a serious favor"". When I was able to calm down enough, I told her I needed money because my account had been seriously over-drafted. The most I said was that it was a payment for my university, and I guess that was enough for her. No more questions asked. We went to the bank later that morning and got it taken care of. Very soon after that, I scheduled the second payment to my credit card.

  
And if you were wondering if I was medicated, I was but not compliant. I had stopped taking my antidepressant and anxiolytic -- both of which I'm clinically maxed out on -- sometime in early November. Why? Because I couldn't remember to take them. My former therapist didn't like this answer, and I didn't like her. I felt I had something to prove every session and ghosted her (I feel mildly bad about this but would rather establish community care anyway). The only really useful conclusion I have is that I am extremely stressed mentally and physically. The best motivator I had was the adrenaline rush of doing things at the last minute; it absolutely fueled me, and I genuinely miss it. I don't have those spikes now and haven't for a really long time. I remember one time I said to her that I wished I would get into a car accident just to feel something like that again. Aside from every appointment feeling like a challenge, I remember quite well when she was questioning about how I thought I would actually function in the ""real world"" and implied that I would not and would eventually crash and burn. I think I understand her reasoning behind saying that to me, but looking back on it, it really upsets me. She was probably right though; I can't be or act like I should, as a fully-functioning member of society.

  
However, I have been taking my medication regularly following the payment/bank/overdraft fiasco. I usually can do more when taking my meds, but it feels like everything dulls: my feelings, the world, my experiences. I lie to my psychiatrist that I'm doing okay because I am too scared of what they will think if I am honest, and it's embarrassing. I am/was pre-med, and they know it, but I have seriously screwed myself over, so we'll see how *that* turns out in a few years. The only time I really opened up was when I mentioned that I have problems concentrating and reading and that it is extremely difficult for me to do and complete things now; she suggested I have sleep apnea and that we should get a sleep study. I don't think that's it though because I usually have good sleep hygiene; I had mentioned that I had fallen asleep twice in two different classes, but it was always following an all-nighter for sad attempts at studying. We never scheduled a consult with a neurologist though, and while I likely would've done it, I actually think that I have undiagnosed ADHD, but I feel I can't say that because they will think I am drug seeking. I have given no other indication that would actually be an issue for me. I barely drink because of the potential drug interactions and don't partake in anything else.

  
I felt worthless because no one wanted to hire me for a long time. I used to be impressive; now, I am not. I don't have a degree because I am a fuck up; I don't have much job experience because I was coddled. I was applying to medical offices to be a receptionist, care coordinator, whatever as well as regional outreach and harm redux organizations. I actually got a call from the director of that place saying that I would be a good fit for their triage coordinator and maybe even a case manager (which paid more and would have included a company car and phone), but when I told him I actually wouldn't have a degree until the end of April, he didn't reject me but instead said to call back. In the meantime though, I received a job offer from a contracted company at a local hospital at the end of March, then completed the online training at the beginning of this month and should start orientation and floor training next week. My first paycheck went toward that stupid credit card. I feel sick that I may have wasted $1300 that I didn't have and likely won't have for a few months, especially if I have to take this class again. I think that I should just give it a rest after this. I was supposed to go back to school publicly in the fall to start a masters degree, but how can I do that if I can't function with a simple undergraduate course?

  
I am in that period where my actions are really hitting me again, yet I can't do anything. It would be less painful to pull my teeth out with pliers and no anesthetic, to smash each finger with a hammer and perhaps even the toes too, for good measure, or maybe even dipping an appendage or two into boiling water for longer than any reasonable person ever would; although, a normal person would never be in a situation in which they voluntarily stuck some part of them in boiling water. I can't bring myself to do any of the work. I can barely stand seeing the email notifications from my school account. Every message asking me about commencement attendance this spring, every email or letter from the company that took photos in December, complete with me in the regalia peeping through the window of the envelopes, feels like a hand around my throat. I can't bring myself to tell the truth or contact my professor. I can't bring myself to quit my job but also can't bring myself to do the things I need to in order to speed up the process of starting actual work. I don't know what to do. I don't feel like a real person anymore and often wish someone would beat me in the face with a shovel or the more peaceful option, that I was made into a rock. A quartz based sedimentary in a populated creek would have been fine. The only time I feel even remotely human is when I think about ... fish. I had a dream in March about having a fish tank again (it was a beautiful discus tank), and I spent two days doing nothing but planning a hypothetical fish tank that, at the time, I didn't have. It stopped for a few days, but I am back to thinking about fish and shrimp more often than not. This time, it's coupled with guilt. My grandmother had another respite stay last week, and my mother and I decided on a whim to get annual passes to the closest aquarium (maybe 2 hours 40 minutes away) and rent a car and go for the day. I enjoyed some of it, but I was mostly nervous just because I scheduled us for a busy time with way too many people for me to actually explore and marvel at the creatures. By the time we left, my arms were sore from locking and crossing them behind my back, if that makes sense. I felt guilty the entire time though, and when we got back to the car, my mother asked if I had fun. I said no a little too quickly, and I think it made her sad.



Thanks for making it this far. I apologize if the formatting is fucked; I'm not even on mobile but an incognito tab on desktop.

Alternative-Rub6623,The mind of a sadist,2,1c64u16,0,"I rarely feel guilty, most of the time i feel that people deserve to be hurt (mentally). I.e, if someone hurts me, they deserve to get hurt the same way but worse if that makes sense. I feel some people can’t understand unless it’s done to them. I look at it as a game even. Like any time someone does something hurtful or disrespectful to me, i see it as them moving their chess piece. Then i’ll make my move and hurt them as well. Even if they do it unintentionally, or intentionally, I tend to think strategically about it; what can I do to make them feel the same pain as me, and waiting out enough time so that they forget what they did to me, therein, when I do it in return, it hurts worse for them because they don’t see the motive. If you pay back the pain too quickly, they may just see it as you doing it out of pettiness. 
    I haven’t always been this way though, I used to be very loving, very caring of every one and overly sensitive to every little thing. I got beat into this way. I had no choice but to turn out like this. It wasn’t planned but I was practically self taught, from experience that you can only care about yourself, and trust no one. Now with this mindset I get hurt a lot less. I may hurt others, but life was never fair to begin with. It is what it is quite literally.
     Do I want to stay like this? I’m not sure. I miss who I was sometimes, but when I think about it I was just a piece of gum stuck on the floor getting stepped on by everyone, until it was flattened. 
     Don’t think i’m some assh*le who is mean to everyone for no reason. No, i’m not an evil person, though i’m not good either. I just try to be fair in every way possible.

Content_Shopping_249,My head feels like it's at its edge,2,1c64jcf,0,"[Hopefully I put this right, I struggle understanding rules at times especially on reddit so if not sorry my bad.]
I've been dealing with a lot of crap these past few years and I think it's reached its limit. I've been trying to improve myself these past few years to come & love myself but even when I did it felt like it was never enough or worse I got hurt in the end by people who lied & never gave a shit about me.
I've been lead on, stepped on, or just told I can't really feel some way I do because guys don't do that. My parents have pushed me to my limits at points because as much as they love me they don't understand the things they do hurt me. They don't believe in my depression or that I could be wrong in any way because I'm not mentally ill apperntly even tho since jr high I've noticed I'm not like others and i wouldve been diagnosed with adhd if my mom didnt stop going to the doctor to see if something was wrong with me due to her thinking ""my son has nothing wrong with him"". At this point I wanna get a diagnosis if I have autisim because other things just set off these tic's that I do but no one irl believes me because I either hide a lot of it from abuse taken so I can fit in & try not to get hurt, they don't want me to think to them that I could be a ""not normal"" person or ""you're not super smart like my friend is, so you cant be"" is what my sister said. I live in America so getting that checked is gonna kill my wallet and recently my job has given me a raise but my hours are so low I only made barely 100 if even this past check. I try asking for more stuff to do but they just think I wanna leave early when in reality I wanna do more but apperntly that's not normal to keep asking for stuff to do, I should know it already even tho I don't.
I'm so tired, I'm drained, and I don't wanna lose my friends for being this way again. I was years ago and I failed them then, I want to love myself because I know I can but I'm just getting fcked over by life now that I'm gon a lose them again. They say I won't but they said that last time too, then look where I ended up. 2 Years of learning to love myself only for nothing but shit it feels like.
I can't afford therapy, I can't afford a doctor, & I for sure can't afford a psychiatrist and I won't get more hours (tried asking my boss but he can't right now till summer i.e 2-4months).
So what's my point in living now for me if when even I love myself, life just finds a way to cheat me out of feeling happy every time I get to it.
I just wanted my parents to love me, I just wanted friends to love me, and I just wanted to make my younger self proud who didnt get to live the life I wanted him to.He just wanted to make everyone happy & himself, he just wanted to talk about games all the time, then everyone else abandoned him man because he wasn't normal to them. just a punch line in a group.
I've been treated like this so much and all I got then was told by my parents ""you should've known better"" BUT I WAS FUCKING 12 I JUST WANTED FRIENDS FOR GOD SAKE AND THEY TREATED ME LIKE ONE I THOUGHT BUT NO ITS MY FAULT.
I came out to my family about my depression, my dad only told me it was a sin, that didn't help and then my dad thinks it's my sister's fault, that I could never be sad so my dad yelled at her. 
I had a close friend who hated my empathy because everyone to them in life was a piece of shit and when I tried helping them after so much crap they put me through, leading me, putting me in the middle of a relastionship drama, getting others to hate me, leaving me on a movie night, they thought I was wanting to treat them like crap when all I wanted was to restart the friendship to forget any drama because I knew deep down they could be a good person, they had mental issues i was willing to say was the reason she was that way. but no one really thinks that they thought, everyone apperntly is out to just date them or shit talk them so they leaked my phone number to there then boyfriend to shit talk me, when the day before I made them a drawing to show how thankful I was for having them as a friend after they told me that we could still be friends. they said they liked it too. and when I called them out in text they said ""I'm not doing this over the phone"" when they could've not lied to my face that last night.
I have my regrets with a lot of this past few years but in the end I did come to love myself just wish it ment more or maybe im just too stupid to understand it.
idk if I will die because tbh I don't want to but my head just really can't tell now what to do besides give up. I just want to get diagnosed so I can see if this whole time I have had something with me that made me different because I want to be like everyone & make real friends but I just can't in person for some reason.

Im 16 years old but my birthday is June 6, on the same month I finish my junior year. Nothing planned, no ambition, no motivation, grades are Four F’s and two D’s.

My family are in the religious side, and they’re Mexican, so they’re both very religious and cultural people. 

Basically this post is about my jealousy or whatever.

I never once had these experiences, anything good, anything bad, or anything that stick with me that transform me into me. 

Everyone I knew, see, and heard, had always gave interesting lives, wether they’re meaningless or irrelevant, they have something to share.

But I am just there, drifting along my life, nothing to say I did it. I am nothing, did nothing, and gain nothing from it.

And I can hear people say “call a therapist”, “You should talk with it with your friend”, “Talk to your parents” or “Talk with anybody”. My parents barely take anything I do for granted, I even spilled out of my mother and she didn’t changed. I don’t have any friends, I don’t have anybody since I never made any connection with them first. And isn’t a therapist need in money to talk to one? Don’t even have a job. And if I do bring this up with my parents, they say “The Holy Spirit” can help me, or “I’m over dramatic for a therapist “.

I never been the great at anything, or to anyone.

I don’t know if I planned to being alive ‘till I graduated my senior because all this stress and anxiety is eating me up.

Seeing everyone having something makes me feel even more empty, knowing I have nothing to say “Oh that’s my/mine___”. 

And what makes it worse is that my older sister is the opposite of me, her life is like a movie, a very inspiring one. But that what makes it worse for me. Seeing my older sister maintains a job as an assistant teacher, building and working as a photographer from scratch, and going to college all at the same time. She got friends and even a great boyfriend.

It makes me hate myself even more when I see her, seeing the praise she gets from our parents and advices, while I can imagine them thinking of me as their son, just a son, nothing more, nothing less.

I even try out things people say, that are popular, that are good, but it all comes it actually disappointing.

RecipeLive2785,Nothing's left,2,1c63kll,0,"Honestly I can't think of a time when I did feel good about myself. It's always been fake. The pictures I take all of them I try not to look at too long because I know that in the end I would just end up seeing another thing I hate about myself, and honestly I don't need another reason. I'm not the best at writing but I know myself so after tonight the possibility of me opening this doc is slim to none but this is the only way for me to feel somewhat heard without having to feel vulnerable in front of someone else. I hate myself and although many people can say this about themselves this for me is a daily routine doing things and praying that at the end of my morning routine I'd look like someone else. I think that's why I try to do natural makeup. I am hoping that one day someone will be able to look past my face and see me. I don't just hate my looks, I also hate my personality. I don't know who I am. I annoy myself and I am loud. I don't mean to be I think I get it from my mom which is just another thing that my mom gave me that I hate. I don't quite know what is wrong with me. It eats away at me piece by piece, the countless minutes looking in the mirror criticizing every little detail, every flaw, every piece of fat, every scar, every pimple. See I did try to kill myself once I think I was in 3rd grade and I dont know what would have happened if I had actually did it. People say that your teen years are the best but I feel terrible between hating myself and pushing things back. It's hard to keep up. Of course when you get left behind you end up falling. The thing is I don't want to fall, I want to run, to keep up but it's hard when your legs don't have enough energy to keep you up. I'd like to think that people would cry at my funeral but I know that they wont and it's not because they didn't like me but because when I'm gone I'm scared that people will finally realize how pathetic I really am. Hiding behind this fake mask it's breaking me, it really is and I'm afraid that I have come as far as I can, stretched as far as I can. I want to tell myself that it gets better. I really do but not even hope can help me. Hope blinds people. It blindfolds people, only letting people see what they want to see for a few seconds before throwing them into a fire again. Watching yourself burn is the worst feeling ever. I don't think I love a single thing about myself, I feel worthless. Like I don't deserve to live, it's a gut wrenching feeling realizing that everything that you do, everything that you try, you will always look like you. I can change my personality but I will forever be stuck in a body I find ugly. People always say just believe in God and he will help, but I honestly think if God loved me he would have let me kill myself in 3rd grade. If God loved me I wouldn't want to die.

girlxxz,I feel like I lost a friend over a stupid reason. Was I in the wrong?,2,1c636i3,0,Hey guys. I’ve just been feeling really upset because I just made a friend not long ago that actually lived close by for once and that was really nice considering that I don’t have any friends from the same town as me. Anyways we would hangout a few times and so on but recently he helped me put game emulators on my computer and such. I appreciated it... So fast forward me and my other friend were talking we have a (bit of a long distance) so we can’t see eachother too often. My friend wanted an emulator as well (or just help on how to find one) and I told her to just contact him on Facebook and she did. I thought he would help her without hesitation because I thought the he would enjoy to do so since he knew so much about it but no….he messaged me and said he was bringing my stuff that I left at his house that night and said we were done as friends because I took advantage of his kindness and said that I stressed him out by having my friend ask him for help ect. He tried to point out a bunch of details to what I did wrong and it just made me feel like a piece of shit. He said that I did it for selfish reasons as well which I didn’t get. I told him that I had one friend and then he goes on about how he’s not gonna be everyone’s errand boy as if I just have a lot of friends and will use him. I just wanted to get my friend some help… I could’ve asked I supposed but I wasn’t thinking in the moment and I told him that. I realized that it was my mistake.  He wouldn’t forgive me and said said that he hopes that I’d go on to learn my lesson and wished me the best in life then just to left me out of of nowhere as a friend and blocked me as soon as he dropped my stuff off. He told me that he talked to me about his boundaries but I didn’t remember hearing anything about that exactly and I’m kind enough of a person to respect that if I did. I don’t have the best memory that I know of….i just feel like I should’ve been given another chance but he wouldn’t budge. I accepted it for what it was.

Talking to friends and coworkers makes it sound like that’s life and suck it up but surely I’m missing something. I have the passion and desire to start my own business and hopefully after a few years I wouldn’t have to work full time but it seems like I have no support from my wife.

LoganWY,My ADHD has gotten worse because of Depression.,2,1c62xxq,0,"I originally tried to post this on r/ADHD However, they keep hiding my posts for some reason so I'm posting it here.

So growing up when I was in school I was on an IEP for ADHD. In middle school and most high school I was able to use my ADHD in a positive way by hyper focusing on assignments or other things that benefit me, I was really good at school because of it. I was able to move my focus from things I was passionate about into things I needed to do like school or other obligations which was super beneficial. I still got distracted time to time but it was something I can easily get around. However, in January of 2021 some unfortunate events occurred that caused me to become depressed. For the first time in a long time I started to struggle in school. The only good thing that was going for me was that I won a school election to be a part of my school's student council which motivated me to continue to do well. Despite that, I had to start using some of my accommodations provided through my IEP which most of the time before I didn't use.

Over the summer of 2021, my depression become even worse. I started to sleep a lot longer, had less energy, had thoughts of hurting myself and more. When school started back up it got better but my depression came waves if that makes sense. For 2 weeks I would be fine and then the next two weeks I would be depressed as hell and would have a hard time in school. Then the cycle would repeat. During those two week periods when everything was fine fine. I was either felt numb or or felt like that I didn't have depression at all and was able to hyper focus on my school work. After I graduated high school, the summer of 2022 was the worst and the darkest point of my whole life. I was going to go to college in the fall of 2022 but I ended up deciding to take a gap year cuz I felt like I wasn't ready because of my mental health. 

When I started college everything was great. It wasn't perfect but I noticed that I had I lost some of my capabilities from before like hyper focusing on things I needed to work on. I ended up failing a few classes and part of it was my mental health and car problems. I ended up deferring the spring semester. During my time in college I went to the university's counseling center and was able to get some therapy. They only offered short-term sessions but it was a great first start. 

Present day my mental health has improved a lot but now I get easily distracted. I have a hard time even doing the simplest of tasks. All I want to do is scroll social media, Play video games, and do nothing. The stuff I have mentioned is not me when I was in high school. For me to do anything productive I have to force myself and it is just so tiring and energy consuming. 

Currently my strategy is to focus on my hygiene, talk to as much people as possible, and to go outside. All that stuff has helped me mentally and I'm feeling better. However, my ADHD Is still worse and I have tried a lot of other strategies to address that. I tried to work for only 20 minutes and then I would give myself a 5-minute break. That works sometimes was still tired and would still end up getting distracted. I tried planners but still I would get distracted. I tried all that basic advice that everyone would give when they have poor time management skills and none of it is working. 

My question is where should I go from here? I'm willing to try therapy but my parents's health insurance is kinda in the air because one of my parents recently got a new job. ",1713335521.0,
NovaFelix,What would happen if I just gave up?,3,1c60pd8,4,"After failing several attempts over the years, I have determined that I am cursed with immortality. If there is a God, he hates me personally and wants me to suffer eternally, and as such has put me in Hell. 

So, since I can't die, what would happen if I were to just stop doing things? Stop going to work, stop paying the bills, stop going to the doctor. What would the consequences be?

I have about 4k in credit card debt (long story but not my fault), 1k in medical debt, and no other bills as I live with my parents and am not expected to pay rent, and they would not kick me out if I stopped contributing to groceries and other expenses. My monthly bills total about $500 and are entirely paying down debt, and I give the rest of my remaining money each month to my family for groceries and stuff. I work 4 days a week and make about $800 per month. I have no savings and no assets (no car etc). 

So. If I just stopped working and stopped paying, what would happen? If I ignored all the calls and letters, ignored any arranged court dates, let it go to collections, would I be arrested? I'd have no wages to garnish. No income. A life of hiding in my room doing absolutely nothing. My credit score would tank but I wasn't planning on using it for anything anyway.

I CANNOT LET MYSELF FEEL HOPE!! I CANNOT LET MYSELF EXPECT ANYTHING GOOD TO HAPPEN! I CAN'T. Because, when it doesn't happen, when it all falls through, the pain comes back. The inner critic gets to tell me how right it was this whole time.

So I've decided that nobody would care if I live or die, swallowed about 50 analgin(sodium metamizole) pills before going to bed for the last time (I thought) , felt so shitty afterwards , simply poisoned myself , the dose wasn't strong enough to kill me, was throwing up all morning( I'd need to give myself at least 4 times more).

I was under the common impression that a blue sky was just a lie we had been told to keep us in check. But I don't know anything about impressions, I don't even feel real anymore. Everything I do, everything I have done, everything I am is just for the sake of continuing. It's such a cynical comedy to see our life, see where we've gone, us, humanity for the sake of nothing. We have manipulated ourselves, murdered infants and loosed ourselves just to find a meaning. To search for something that doesn't exist. It is so incredibly tedious to just admit there is no sense to the comedy of life, there is no goal, nor god, nor anyone to protect or save us. We are just all alone, but we'd do anything to swear it's not true.  
  
And sometimes, every time, I just can't deal with this shit anymore. And then I go out, and it's still raining, but I do the only thing that has kept me from falling or failing, I don't know.   
I smile. And I do it again, and again, and again, and again, and again, until I am nothing but a functioning member of society. I joke about having an existential crisis... because no one seems to get it, get what I feel... and everybody laughs. My body laughs. I still loath myself for feeling that way though.   
Anyways, I have come to the conclusion that I will always be sick. Because I drop the mask when I'm alone. Just because. And because doing the bare minimum requires efforts to me that are comparable to lifting that very sky above my head and making it kiss me. Every one does it so easily though. It's quite disturbing when I think about it, but coming from me, I guess that's quite ironic.

When I was in school at least teachers cared about me, about me getting good grades. It was their job, I know, but still, they cared.

tw//mention of suicide

i have lived with my family for 21 consecutive years. from the age of 12 i developed an extreme case of anxiety where for every second i was in high school, i would experience nausea, heart palpitations, sharp chest pains, dizzy spells, trembling, and whatever other generic symptom of fight or flight responses activating. my high school life was exhausting. gradually developing worsening depression and being absolutely exhausted in following routine schooling. being unable to perform well in tests (as an academic student) as these anxiety symptoms changed the challenge to not vomiting in front of my peers. naturally friends came and went for different reasons, passive or bad (the bad stemmed from a panic attack i had over something someone did, which i did apologise for). in my last year of high school, despite fighting against my body and mind, i was unable to attain the graduate certificate in my country, as I had to complete a third of that year from home during Covid-19s peak. as you can imagine, my whole world fell down upon me.

as for my family dynamic, i love my family. i am aware they all do their best and it never, ever comes with bad intention. i had a pretty normal, fortunate childhood, for which i am very grateful for. once i hit adolescence, naturally i became ""moody"" and with puberty striking i became more analytical of how the world around me affects me. this is where my anxiety and depression first rooted. ironically like many households would say, my family is very different. we are a largely sized direct family, with multiple disabilities/mental conditions. for this reason, at times i have felt neglected by sheer quantity of us, especially when one of my siblings with a more severe circumstance, was born about a year and a half after me. 

perhaps it came with age, or maybe it is just them, but one of my parents became difficult to talk to as i hit teenage years. as a preface to this, due to how busy my parents were, i was never able to go to grocery stores or really go out to any place that wasn't school. once in a blue moon id arrange something with friends and theyd say yes (to which I'd be so thankful for), but for the most part i was unfortunately and unintentionally contained. for safety reasons i could not leave the house to go for walks, and there wasn't much spare time in my parents' lives for them to conveniently drop me at places had i asked. i felt as though the parent in question became more critical and restrictive towards me. i felt many conversations were needlessly long and inadvertently (but sometimes straight up) accusatory. at the age i am now, i no longer remember the subject of these quarrels, i just remember it was suffocating how they'd come into my room and kind of lecture me over things i didnt actually do (I'd tell them this, saying things like ""i would never do that"", and theyd follow up with ""no I'm just saying""). It didn't feel great when they'd come into my space and talk about thingd that although may be guidance, would come off as accusatory. This parent struggles with listening and is unfortunately not great with their words, making talks extremely long (a trait i unfortunately adopted and am trying desperately to lose). So throughout my teenage years i was tormented by high school, the inability to leave the house, the constant and unintentionally belittling voice of this parent, as well as the typical symptoms of puberty and spiralling anxiety and depression.

i have been open to accountability in the dynamic between this parent and i, though i am not the only child who has had this problem. nor am i the first. i know with my whole heart that this parent does everything out of love and good intention. it is just that on a literal level until i can be in a healthy, stable mindset, we are incompatible. as i mentioned, our family composition is very diverse and complicated, so the responsibility that fell upon my parents is so, so, so heavy. it is indisputable fact that they are shouldering their own burdens, which makes this even harder for me. i know theyre trying so hard. they have been this whole time. they rely on pensions as with high-demand disability in the household, they cannot afford to leave and have given up working for many decades now. i know the weight on their shoulders is more than i could ever imagine. i feel so awful but i was born into this. i am part of the problem. our bills are so expensive, i know we live in tough times, but the amount of electricity needed to keep the house going for 7 people is in the quadruple digits and its hurting us very badly.

i am unemployed. i have always been unemployed. i have applied for so many jobs, but they would turn me down all the time. in the time through highschool where i could never leave the house (i would beg my parents to take me to stores to apply for jobs, but they were always busy) i had to apply online all the time and theyd always say there's no placement available near me. Even now i have applied for 3 jobs recently. I did an UNPAID day of work at one and then they ghosted me, i did an interview online and passed through to a face-to-face interview and was ghosted, and another online interview was ghosted. i know being rejected so many times is normal, but as my age catches up to me i am just so ashamed and under so much pressure with how my family is struggling and how I'll never be able to have my own future. My anxiety is so bad that i am To-Death afraid of many jobs because i am so incapable in many aspects. My mental illnesses have caused strong concentration and memory issues, so i cannot recall and remember information/menus on jobs. I have never really been allowed to cook, so i have no understanding of food and hospitality. I have no balance and poor hand-eye coordination. I am afraid of heights. I have a recently develop insensitivity to heat where my temper rises substantially. I have qualifications to work in pre-schools as an assistant, but the wage and attitudes of workers there have just completely demotivated me and made me feel pathetic. I know skills can be learnt, but i am in such bad shape I don't think i can learn anything anymore.

I cannot drive either. I attempted learning for a bit in high school, but got frustrated internally as at some point my parents stopped offering criticism and it made me feel like i wasn't doing good enough (we had only practised in a car park). I semi-recently picked it up again and got onto the road, but it is just So expensive and i really need someone who explains in depth. I can't afford it otherwise.

I am only doing university work to ensure i still make some progress in life. I have a forced passion for childhood education (as i like my life when i was young and want to ensure students go into high school/college with better mentality than i did) and have been enrolled in a university course for some time now. I don't know if I'll make it. so far i have passed every subject, but i continue to struggle through without actually retaining the information i am learning. It just gets applied to assessments then disappears. This is the only aspect of my life that makes me feel like im doing something good. Though it is so small and is more like an excuse.

My family has a house fully bought as it was a long time ago. A house that is unintentionally destroying my mental. At this rate i feel my existence is just dirt. I am incapable of everything. I have no friends as the ones i made in high school either abandoned me while i had to leave year 12, or moved overseas after highschool. I am afraid of women due to beauty standards and drama, and i am terrified of talking to people with no exception other than my boyfriend and my blood family. My anxiety and depression are at their worst (and have been for many years now). I know its something i need to work on, its something even my parents have said that I can't live like this, but it's impossible. I am trying to change. I have always been. Just minor steps at a time. But i always get hit back down, whether out of good or bad.

as you can probably imagine, i am so enveloped in pity for myself. i have tried to be resilient. i have tried to change my mind over and over. but I can't. it always crashes back down and there's no escape. 

i can't handle it anymore. i have been standing at the edge of a cliff since i was 13. i have only stopped myself from falling as ending it is heavily regarded as selfish and disgusting by someone in my household. i love the people around me and never want to traumatise them like that. and my boyfriend, i love him more than anything in the world. meeting him again was the luckiest experience life has given me. I didn't intend to enter a relationship with him as my mental was and is so bad, but he started it and i just melted, feeling proper love and comfort for the first time in a constantly stressed life. i love these people so much. so, so much.

but I can't do it anymore. i will never be able to afford a house. its over. people my age who have been working since 16 feel they will never own a house. i am crushed under the weight of my whole life and afraid of the people around me. I can't do it anymore. I can't. I can't. I desperately, desperately, have always wanted to just end it. I stayed here not for myself but for the people around me and to not be thought of negatively once i go. I am at my limit. I am not in a mindset where i want to even try anymore. Despite this i have tried and tried and tried and driving, uni, being pretty, jobs, and so much more. With no motivation id grab it by the neck as a last effort and none of it ever works.

I know its important to keep trying. But im so tired. Im so exhausted. Is it really that bad for me to just, go? It hurts. it's agonising. I'm tired and i want to rest for a long time. I don't want to try. I have lived, laughed, and loved. I am not a good influence with how strong my anxiety is. I've had enough. I can't keep going.

Is that so bad? I know i am so lucky to be where i am. There are people in war. Innocent bystanders. Homeless individuals just getting by. I am sorry for being so weak. I Just cant take it.

Without proper sleep, I am getting terribly depressed despite being on a mood stabilizer called Lamictal. I’ve tried the basic things like cutting down caffeine, excercise, and reading a book to rest the eyes. May as well tell me to eat candy. These habits are not effective in an extreme case like mine.

Voidful-,I’m actually feeling a bit better,6,1c5np79,0,"From a middle of last year to around last month, I was pretty dead set on killing myself. I hated my life and was pretty certain I could follow through with it. But for the past few weeks I’ve actually been feeling a bit better. This is my first hopeful post on this subreddit. 

When I was in college last semester, I had zero friends and was feeling depressed and suicidal for a large portion of every single day. I wasn’t doing well in most of my classes and had next to no motivation to do anything productive. I was getting drunk and high alone nearly every night because it was the only escape from reality I could find. The people in my dorm bullied me and even talked shit about me for nearly an hour while I was even in the same room. They didn’t give a single shit if I overheard or not. I planned on killing myself after doing a few things. I wanted to finish the semester just to say I’ve gotten through one semester, I wanted to watch some of my favorite shows one last time, eat at my favorite restaurants one last time, and finish my Attack on Titan Funko Pop collection. After this I could die in peace.

While completing these last tasks, it seems the universe threw me a bone. I reconnected with an old friend and made a new one. Now I’ve been hanging out with friends usually around once a week. When I’m with positive peers, I don’t feel completely shitty. I can actually have fun for the first time in years. 

I still feel bad and hopeless a lot, but way less often. I have been single my entire life and that makes me feel awful since I yearn for love and connection, but I’m less lonely because I at least have a few friends. I wouldn’t call myself suicidal anymore because I don’t feel urges to do so nor have I made any recent plans to kill myself. I don’t necessarily want to be alive, however, I can comfortably push off killing myself for a while. I can always do it sometime in the distant future. This way I’m never trapped. I’m in community college and I’m doing well in my few classes, and I’ve stopped getting high and reduced my drinking quite a bit. I started a new Funko Pop collection too which keeps me a bit more interested in life. It also keeps me from killing myself because I don’t want to die without collecting all the Rick and Morty Funko Pops. Also, I’m actually motivated to get a job now too. I feel like I can remain motivated to actually do shifts now.

It’s been so long since I wasn’t deeply suicidal and utterly miserable. I’m glad I’m feeling a little better. You know, I don’t really know if I’ll die from old age or natural causes, part of me is still confident that I’ll die by my own hands since I’m 99% sure I’ll never have a spouse and children in my lifetime, but at least I’m pretty sure I’ll be here a while longer.

HelterSkelterOtaku,I lost my orange baby boy. ,4,1c5on4c,2,"My orange baby boy, Boromir, wasn't even a year and a half yet, was euthanized on Sunday. The Sunday before, my baby Boromir stopped eating, wouldn't drink water, wouldn't go to the bathroom, and he kept throwing up. We immediately took him to the vet next day. They did x-rays, and said they discovered blockages. They gave him iv fluids and some meds and then sent him home with an assortment of meds to stimulate his appetite and help him with the vomiting and his bathroom issues. Few days past and it isn't working; he still refused to eat anything we tried to give him, and we gave him everything, or drink any water. He still was vomiting and not using the bathroom. Took him back to the vet, and they gave him more iv and changed the meds and told us if it doesn't change in a few days that we would need to do exploratory surgery to see what's going on. Nothing changes. So we schedule the surgery for Sunday morning. He was super cuddly (more than usual) the night before. We take him to the vet, and I'm hopeful that they'll fix him right up, so I only gave him a head pat not knowing this was the last time I was going to see him. They say to come back in a few hours. An hour later we (my wife and I) get a call from the vet. They say he swallowed a string and it destroyed his intestines so bad that there's nothing they can do, and that we need to come down and say our goodbyes. It was so heart-rending to see him on the table like that. The vet shows us part of what was inside him. It looks exactly like my black sewing thread that I've been using to put patches on my vest. I can't get the image of her giving him the shots, checking her watch, nodding and saying that he's gone, his lifeless body, out of my head. My poor baby boy, he was so innocent and loving and sweet. He didnt deserve this. Now I can't stop blaming myself. My wife keeps saying it's not my fault and that the string looked different than my thread and that it wasn't my thread. But I know what I saw. It was my thread. It was my fault. I killed my boy. If I wasn't so careless and thoughtless, and cleaned up my sewing mess better he'd still be here. If I wasn't so hasty my sweet boy would still be alive. I hate myself. My brain keeps expecting to see the little guy bound around the corner, doing his patrols (he's the alpha), trying to steal his sisters food. Expecting him to hop into bed to cuddle us for the night. Out of the corner of my eye, my brain sees him. It's so weird. I know he's gone, and there's nothing I can do to change it. But I wish I could rewind time. Never sew patches on my vest, or not be so careless, spend the whole night up with him instead of going to sleep. Give him more than a head pat when he was going to his surgery. I am utterly destroyed and filled with so much self-hatred self-animosity and self-loathing.

literally death which is very sad because i wasn't like that in the past.

RedditName0126,Huge Wave Tonight at Dinner,1,1c5yolb,0,"I'm on a business trip right now half the country away from my wife, though that honestly isn't the worst thing as I've found I'm typically less anxious and depressed when not around her. A perk of these trips is that I get out a bit more and definitely socialize more, which for the most part helps.

Tonight at dinner, I had a massive wave of depression crash over me. A sort of ""I don't deserve to be around these people"" feeling that made me feel like I was sort of isolated from them. I was one of only two of us not having any wine with dinner, and I am admittedly more quiet and reserved while sober as a bit of a buzz helps me unwind and open up around others.

I want to say it was mainly brought on because we were all talking about ourselves and getting to know each other more, and while most of the table was made up of married folks, they all come across as far more happily married than I am (barring one coworker who I know is prepping for a divorce but is keeping up the pretext of a happy marriage around the others). My situation back home isn't great, and I think this just reminded me of that being true.

It's been a few hours since then, and I still haven't quite shaken it off. I listened to some music to try and take my mind off it and even danced around a little. Had a short video call with my wife.

I’ve lost everyone in my life, my depression is too much for everyone. I didn’t choose to be this way; my life would’ve been so much easier without this. I’ve attempted suicide multiple times this past year, wishing it would’ve worked each time. 

My family don’t understand and think I’m being super ungrateful and unappreciative of all they’ve given me. All my friends are done with me and have left me one by one and I don’t blame them, I’m too much for everyone. At least this way it’s not going to hurt anyone when I go. The one person who it seemed actually cared basically said it’s too much for her as well. She’s got enough on her plate without me adding to it and she’s already having a hard time at work. Started to feel like she only wanted me around when I was fine or needed a favour.

Wittle_Mama,My boyfriend got real with me about my depression and I wasn’t ready to hear it,491,1c4q8w2,40,"I’ve been in a downward spiral for a few months but was treading water. The past few weeks have been really rough for me. I have never been as genuinely suicidal as I am right now. I’ve always struggled with the motivation to get going and do things and be outgoing (I’m also just an introvert - social events usually drain me and that’s not a bad thing, it’s just who I am), but I don’t enjoy ANYTHING right now. When I go out and do things lately I just want to go back home and go back to sleep. 

Aside from just being an introvert naturally, I’m also dealing with a lot of social anxiety and pressure right now. It’s overwhelming feeling like everyone expects something from me but I feel like I can hardly take care of myself. I’ve had some interpersonal issues lately that have been hard for me to process. I feel anxious and fearful in most social interactions lately. I just feel like a monster and like no one truly likes me. 

My boyfriend and I have a little bit of an emotional discussion about it, he tells me he’s here for me and that I’m important to him and everything. 

Two days later we have a FIGHT because he and a friend planned something and it was apparently not as optional as he made it seem to me. We went out the night before with a bunch of people he knows that I have never met before and we had also done something that morning.  I tell him to go without me. 

We then have an argument about how he’s putting in all of the effort and I never want to do anything, all I want to do is sleep. He feels 
like he has to keep it together for both of us. 

All of these things are very valid and I feel really bad but I don’t feel like I can give anymore right now and it the timing feels poor and unfair. Don’t tell me you’re here for me when you’re clearly not.

I feel lost and honestly don't know what to do for my future. Don't get me wrong, I have a perfect home (for me) and perfect environmental conditions (for me). I couldn't ask for more. But as a man who needs purpose, every night when I'm alone, I feel purposeless. I really have no vision for my future, and it haunts me; it scares me (I'm afraid I might fail in the future). Again, please don't get me wrong. Of course, I have some small goals like any teenager has, like getting abs this summer or making it to varsity for my school's basketball team. I've actually achieved all that. I even ran 20km this morning in under 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I feel very confident and happy about that today. But again, once the loneliness hits me at night, I feel very pathetic and worthless. Yes, I can say for sure I'm not average for my age; I'm confident to say that because of all my accomplishments. But I feel like a piece of trash compared to the people around me, the people who know what they want in the future and are now working on it. Again, don't get me wrong. I'm also studying hard. I'm actually in a science high school myself. But in reality, I'm not having a good time with myself, with my own reality.

Life is not a movie, life shows no mercy, life will not one day say, ""you've been trying really hard for a really long time.. you deserve this win""–*flips you a used civic or something*– it simply doesnt work that way. 

I have been homeless for years (I'm staying at a family's house currently, thank god; I was sleeping in parking lots in my car, that us until it got towed). I really try my ass off to find work and dont understand what I'm doing so wrong to not be getting anywhere.

I was working a decent job for about a year, I was doing well, and saving momey while sleeping in my car. I was building credit too.
I tried and tried, working my ass off 12 hours a day or more, 7 days a week- overtime, covering whenever possible, and just couldnt get any housing places to look at me seriously, couldnt just stack and save and enjoy any part of it, as I was in survival mode most of the time.

I lost that job bc the company fell apart due to, poor management and employees. I've now used up the entirety of what I had saved to afford food and things that I've needed and am out of food, and cant even go pick up my clothing because uber is expensive.

I missed another psych appointment for my ADHD medication, which lead to the  doctor letting me go as a patient - I've missed 3 new doctors appointments, and with my insurance I'm limited with choices; I just can't make it out to these doctors with the resources I have, and even online docs are a struggle and want you to go to 4 appointments before anything actually happens.. so needless to say I have lost hope on that front and decided I am fine without em if it's going to be that much trouble.

So... I'm out of meds, I'm sleeping at a family members house, I'm dead broke, I'm car-less (w/out insurance), I have absolutely no purpose as far as all employers are concerned, and I have nobody around to give a fuck for me, so I'm having round-the-clock, silent, panic-attacks and freezing up often.
I'm running my ideas in loops because I never reach the end of the idea in time, before my brain kicks me into another one, or I decide to watch the wall for an hour until I forget what I'm doing.

I just dont get how people are actually living.. I dont.
Not in the cliche ""the economy sucks, lifes hard""- kinda way but like truly baffled at how there are actually people who get up, every day, and just live life without being weighed down so hard by every god damn thing.
Are you just handling it better than I, do I have an abnormal amount of weight because frankly, I know for certain that I'm still in a much better position than some and this is still impossible.

Idk. I am just feeling like I have no direction again, I have no reason to get up, I cant get ahead of poverty, and I'm so tired of trying every day, as hard as I feel I do, just to go to backpedal to sleep and wake up to the same monotonous routine of insanity. 

Any real advice that hasn't been on a 'Motivational' poster or sign is needed please, I am just at a loss with how quickly things can start to look up, and then suddenly drop you lower than before, and how often this continues to happen.

I feel so ashamed, I studied and practiced and did all that I was supposed to do but its like it doesnt matter. Ive struggled with depression all my life but it never used to be this bad. I think now what if I pass this just to fail another course down the line again. I wish I could switch to something else but Im already so deep in this programme and if I were to do something else, I would be starting over from scratch.

praxeti,My irrelevancy is hurting me,1,1c5uw41,1,"I've always found myself as a spare part for most of my life but the older I'm getting the worse it's starting to sting now.
I'm now 24 and have found that in every friend group I have, I'm the one that has to ask to be included. I have 3 people that message me every day as a guarantee - one will actually talk about my interests and is honestly a great friend. Another we just art to each other, and the last one usually seems to just ignore anything I mention to tell me about their recent misgivings.
Now I have friends. I've had many for a long time. But I will still find myself staring at a screen wondering where I went wrong to have no one to talk to. I told a few people today about exciting plans I have this year - going to the Netherlands and having my first ever flight - and one of them responded. The others ignored it and kept on talking. I can only assume I'm just well, boring?? Or not fun to talk to? I struggle with social anxiety and have for a while so I 100% know I am very likely the problem and this rant is probably stupid as it is my fault, but I just wish I could feel more relevant in peoples lives?

My cat of 18 years passed a few days ago and I was distraught, and even then the most I got from some people is :c before they carried on talking about themselves, or a courtesy like on a twitter post. I just don't know what to do, I really needed someone to offer me a hand, a shoulder to lean on or something similar and it just wasn't there.

I guess it just stings knowing I am no one's first choice and likely never will be. I don't know how to make people like me more, or even if there is any way. Being socially awkward, depressed and unattractive makes it pretty difficult to do most things I find.

I've got a decent job, I updated my wardrobe and recently I've started going out and doing things. Really anything to get me out the house. I've been going to lots of concerts (mostly alone) I went bouldering I've been to art exhibits, opera and ballet. It's getting to the point where I need put it all in a diary app so I don't accidentally double book stuff. I also recently picked up reading and playing the bass guitar as hobbies. I regularly meet up with friends now too. Plus I'm living at hime so family I'd close by for support. I tried online dating that hasn't gone very well but hey ho we keep moving right and at least I've out my self out there. 

All this when I reflect at where I was two years ago this feels like it should be an amazing improvement. If you asked me where I thought I'd be in 2 years then I'd say dead at the bottom of a river or something. The problem is I don't really feel much better. Like I really enjoy all the stuff I'm doing. I've had some less then amazing experiences sure but I'm often trying new things and they don't always work out that's fine. I mean that it feels like in every moment when I'm not actively doing an activity I'm filled with this well of loneliness. IDK like I'll go to a concert and for the first 20 mins after I feel like I'm on a high then when I get on the train home I feel so empty and alone.

ProcedureOne9323,If my depressed gf (25F) of 2+ yrs broke up w/ me and I plan to wait until she reaches out first. Am I taking responsibility for her emotions if I'm feeling guilty about not even offering a word of support w/o burden?,1,1c5udbx,0,"My long-term gf of 2.5 years broke up with me due to her depression. She's been dealing with depression even since we were friends (not dating), but this time it's the worst I've seen her. The hours at her current job, her uncertainties on her career, whether she has to move or not once her lease it up, her sense of self, etc. I've dealt with anxiety in the past but never dealt with depression. I'd like to spend this time apart to learn about better ways of managing my anxiety and checking on resources to better understand depression and what depressed people go through..

She says I was the best bf that she's ever had, and that she's never felt so scared and emotional about having to break up with a guy. She says she feels I deserve somebody better than her who could show love to me like I deserved. And that she noticed she wasn't able to give me love like she used to before. The night we broke up we agreed to meet up the week after so she could give me my stuff back from her apartment. We agreed to stay friends, that she didn't want to lose me as a person in her life, she'd like for me to still send her pictures of my cat, even meet if I'm potentially in town (Boston <-> NYC), etc... 

&#x200B;

I respect that she needs space and haven't reached out to her after a couple days, and plan to wait until she's comfortable with reaching out to me first (If she decides to at all of course). 

I'm conflicted on a couple things. firstly, I read that depressed people need emotional support and might push away the people they love. However scared I am, I feel she must be 10x more scared than I am doing. Am I doing the right thing by letting her be to herself? 

Secondly, I feel like in my attempt to not be misunderstood, I've been trying to control her feelings and invalidate her emotions by trying to explain myself constantly. And I hadn't realized I was burdening/pressuring her to commit more than she was able/willing to. I believe that I had broken the emotional & psychological safety she had in me + made her question if our goals were aligned to begin with. Is me thinking this way a way that I'm blaming myself for the breakup? (<- This is more for a sanity check I think as I think a lot but also tend to over think a lot as well)

 Any advice or words of wisdoms would be greatly appreciated.

YuuichiSuzuki,Story for sad peeps.,2,1c5ou6a,0,"Matthew Silver grew up in a family full of addiction. Despite his difficult circumstances, he was a happy child. At the age of 9, he went to foster care. Around 11 years old, Matthew developed his first crush on a girl in his foster care system. However, she returned to her biological family, leaving Matthew feeling lonelier and more isolated than before. In time, Matthew developed another crush, but it isn't the most important part of his story, being more puppy love than anything. 

Matthew Silver was eventually transferred to another foster care system for boys only, where he developed a bad habit of lashing out at minor insults and buying drugs for 'friends' in exchange for services, like taking him out to the store when he want or restaurants. On the outside, he maintained his happy demeanor, but on the inside, he struggled with anger issues. Despite his internal turmoil, he never directly consumed drugs himself, prioritizing his own health but not others.

After the sixth month of Matthew Silver's time in that foster care, he moved to another foster care that his biological brother was also living in. This foster care was strict, with strict rules on time, food consumption, bed times, and more. Despite these restrictions, he maintained his manners. He also made a few friends, which may be the last connection he felt for anyone besides his brother.

After a year in the strict foster care, Matthew Silver was adopted at age 13 by the same strict foster parents. His adoptive brothers and he now shared one room in a small house, and he was homeschooled. He started hating everything during this period and fell into a depression. He cleaned obsessively and trapped his head in a book, but he collapsed several times while living in the house. He stopped talking to anyone at the church after a bad experience at a church camp, and he became even more isolated. His adoptive mom became abusive and restricted food and activities, and even became physical.

After yet another move, Matthew Silver found himself in a new state, living with his adoptive mother closer to her family. Although she stopped hitting him, he had grown indifferent to her actions. He suffered panic attacks and even considered suicide at one point, but he never gained the courage to follow through with the latter, due to believing if he was to take his own life and if there was a God, then he surely would go to hell. He began to have difficulty differentiating between reality and dream, and whenever someone tried to discuss his thoughts, he would suffer another panic attack. Then, about a year ago, he had his last crush, though he didn't really know why he liked her.

Then, Matthew Silver was spending time at his crush's father's camper, and he started drinking for the first time in his life. His crush kept sitting closer to his brother, and Matthew kept drinking. Her dad was sitting across the fire from Matthew. They were planning to go kayaking later that night. When his crush went to go sleep in the camper, Matthew and his brother left to check the bait. Matthew's brother was goofing around, playing with a catfish and saying 'wanna see my weiner?' And wiggling the catfish on front of them to some older girls on accident, and Matthew was leaning against a tree. Suddenly, all the emotions Matthew has been bottling up came crashing down on him, and he began to cry. This was the first time he showed any emotions besides embarrassment to someone who wasn't in his family. Since then, he feels isolated and useless whenever he is around others.

And to stop seeking attention from those you first meet?,1,1c5tvep,0,"Im nervous to post this but to start with, 80% of my depression is due to the fact im single and want a gf to go through life with and eventually settle down. (Most peoples goals lol) Ive had this for what feels like for ever since i was a teen. It just steadly grows worse with the relationships that go bad or the longer time goes on since we aren't getting any younger. 

For context Ive always hated being alone in general. Like when i play pc (my escape from reality) im always wanting some one to be in vc with me even if we arent playing or talking. Ive just been very anxious at doing things alone and being alone/single. And i know its unhealthy but i cant help it no matter what I do. Then i fall into depression. when i go to social events and see all the couples it triggers it bad. No i dont resent or hate on couples i genuinely enjoy that thoes people are happy. It just makes me remember im alone and might be forever..

My other issue is seeking attention when i meet new people i like or friends i make. I try my hardest to not constantly text or call them being im scared they might lose interest or not want me around when im depressed. When im not depressed i can take the it is what it is route and be fine unless its a love interest. Its not as bad but i know i do it at times

My question is how can i be at peace with being alone and not hurt every time i see people in relationship and not be wanting attention so much from people?

sinodauce131,Life feels like one giant injustice,2,1c5mjap,1,"Venting. I'm (M20) a college student. Yesterday, I had a fight with my girlfriend (20) about the recent direction of my life. My school attendance has been horrible, and I've done nothing but laze around in my bed and hang out with her. I'm not a very ""driven"" person. I have no serious ambitions and little willpower/motivation on most days. Contrast this with my GF, who is one of the most type-A people I've ever met. She's in multiple clubs, an internship, has a near-perfect GPA, and maintains an active social life. Yesterday, I called her and she got angry at the state that I was in (I had just woken up at a really late time in the day). She then explained how frustrating it was to be with someone that was ""throwing their life away."" She wanted to know my plan for the future and what I wanted to do with my life, and I was at a loss for a response.

I don't blame her. I would be angry at myself, too. I'm a lazy, unmotivated, loser, and frankly, it's amazing that she found me attractive in the first place. This conversation only reaffirmed how much I don't want to live any more, though. I just don't have what it takes. Being a functional adult requires a level of coordination, focus, and drive that I just can't muster. It's not like I haven't had opportunities to succeed, either. I come from a very privileged background with many people who want to support me. I just don't care. Talk about pathetic.

I've struggled with depression for around 17 years now. The last 2.5/3 years I finally felt like I've been getting a grip on it, from time to time.

My depression is mostly fed by an extreme feeling of loneliness and uselessness. 

Also around 2 years ago I met a couple,  and we quickly became friends. We match in a lot of ways and I'm extremely grateful to have met them. But then there's the other side.

Meeting her/them is like Russian roulette. I always have a great time but there's a 50/50 chance seeing/talking/calling with her massively triggers my depression. I see in her and in their relationship everything I want to have for myself. Everything I miss in my own life. This realization often starts me spiralling down.

Since around two months I'm massively struggling with suicidal thoughts again. I'm tired of life, so incredibly tired. Also I've got no support irl. I've tried talking to family and friends before, they don't understand and don't know how to help. I'm in therapy for the 5th time in my life, and I feel like we're doing good stuff and making good steps but it doesn't make my depression any less. The people I can talk to are this couple.

In all honesty I don't even get excited to see them anymore. I explained this in more minor detail to the friend I'm closer with and he still wants to come over to talk (I guess depite my minor detailing he still caught on) and I don't know HOW to talk about all my bullshit without sounding like a pathetic subhuman.

Recently I moved to a new city and things have been getting worse mentally. Mainly because I live alone and I have 'baggage' I didn't realize I've had until very recently. I went to see a therapist in this new city and she was a good person, but it just didn't work on me.

7 years ago I actually got involved with a psychiatrist during high school. I almost forgot about this point in my life, but they had me on some meds for mild depression. It wasn't anything 'serious' but I still had to take the meds (that's what my parents said anyway). Funnily enough I can't remember why I stopped taking those meds or what happened.. my parents and I just stopped going there and I just stopped taking the meds.. Not sure what happened.

I'm older and I can do stuff on my own now. I tried seeing a therapist in this new city and it didn't click, but would looking into seeing a psychiatrist be the right move? I guess I'm worried about the cost, but I have insurance for everything. What do you think? I think I still have mild depression, but I'd rather see a psychiatrist/doctor first.

Hi everybody! I’m new here, I’ve been watching people sharing their stories and experiences on reddit.

 Today I would like to share my depression.  It’s difficult to say exactly when it started, given that I didn’t have psychologist's help for a long time.

 Now I’m 26, I have no children, no husband, my first boyfriend turned out to be an abuser, he tried to throw me out of the balcony when I lost my mother.  I lost my father, grandfather, uncles, mother, grandmother.  I do not have anyone.
 All I have is depression, health problems, unfulfilled dreams and debts.

 My dad was killed in 2011.  These were rich people who wanted to have fun in the village.  Everyone knew the truth, but no one wanted to speak out against it. Yes, that’s how the matter was hushed up.  And my mother died from a serious illness.  I took out a loan to cure her, without her will.  Nothing succeeded.  

Now I am alone with my depression and debts.  It’s hard for me, I don’t know how to cope with it, I have to work 24/7 at least to pay for my accommodation, not to mention debts.

 It's terrible to realize that you screwed up everything.  I'm lying on the bed and have no strength to do smth.  I work hard and it caused several diseases, including those that require surgical intervention.  I can’t cope with my debts, my mental state, or my already acquired illnesses.

 The only thing that helps me stay afloat is that I love life, not this one, of course, I just know that life is beautiful.  And everyone deserves a chance at a happy life, so to speak.

Please, write comments.

 I would be very grateful if those who have been in a similar situation tell me how you cope with it.",1713294673.0,

I just turned 17 a couple of days ago and I'm at my limit I just can't do this anymore. I've lived with the motto that life will get better so just tough it, but it hasn't gotten any better. Every year ever since I could remember I would tell myself that everything will work out and life will start looking brighter but it doesn't. I hate it here, everything and everyone in my life lets me down, even my own mother hates me and my father couldn't care any less about me (well he does care as long as his honor is involved). Kids in school mock me, some ignore me, and some talk shit about me and this has been a thing ever since I started school aka 1st grade (bullied since day 1 ig). I have ""friends"" or yeah people that wouldn't even do me the smallest favor even if I payed them. But that's the drill life is shitty every day, every minor inconvenience I think about just ending it even when I'm happy I just know life will go back to shitty after this happy moment passes so why not just end it. 

Honestly, I don't even know what I'm saying I'm just yapping at this point but yeah I feel so shitty anyone got any tips on how to get better if not how to end it easily? ",1713281018.0,

Qc_guy,I attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Trying to find fulfillment in life again,21,1c54x3e,9,"Some context, a am 30 [M] and living in the US.  

3 weeks ago today I got out of the hospital after spending about 5 days there after attempting suicide via intentional overdose.  I had old painkiller prescriptions from previous surgeries (including some opiates) that I had kept for about 6-7 years for this purpose, but I was never truly honest with myself about why I kept them around until these last few months.  I took these pills and some OTC stuff like 6-8 nyquill pills and a bunch of melotonin.  I wanted to fall asleep and not wake up.  Although I thought about also getting fucked up for this occasion, I had only 1 beer left in my fridge and I also thought drinking a ton of beer (because I hate the taste of liquor) would just risk me puking everything out. 

I am an engineer and have a good career going for me.  6 months ago i moved to a different part of the country to a bigger plant within my industry, because the company had better benefits and it seemed just like a good overall opportunity.  Money was better as well but that was just a plus.  Growing up my family would move every 2-3 years to diffrent parts of the country so I thought what's the big deal.  I had spent my entire adult life in one major US city since I went out there for college, and had an network of freinds, family and professional connections, I could always go back there is what I would tell myself.

I am not married and have no kids, I moved out to this new part of the country by myself, and things started to quickly feel off.  The job was fine, people were nice, the area was decent, and I was just an hour and half from some really nice beaches (much closer than I was in my old city).  However, certain things about the job would start to stress my out, since this is a massive plant, theres a bunch of people you need to track down to get things moving.  This is to be expected as part of the adjustment, but became a major stressor for me.  In addition to just trying to adjust to the area and meet people.  I have been on and off with therapists through the years, mainly online.  I decided a few weeks into the new job I should start again, to get ahead of my building anxiety.

I became a walking ball of anxiety and stress everyday.  I would be mentally fried at the end of everyday, even though my workload wasn't even yet as big as it was at my old job.  I would talk to my therapist, reached out to friends and old collegues for advice or just to talk, but nothign made me feel better.  I had lost interest in any of my hobbies and interests.  My parents (who live a 7 hour drive away) grew concerned and drove out to visit for a weekend in mid-february.  My moods would very greatly over the course of a week.  I felt better when they visited but it was also fleeting as anytime I had felt good recently was that way.  St Pattys day weekend I took the following monday off work and went to a beach town about 2 hours away for the weekend, thinking i just needed to get out of town. I had a blast of a weekend, drinking and making friends with strangers, but also drove back to my air bnb when it was just a 15 min drive, unusual for me, I always uber in such circumstances.  The monday i was supposed to drive back, I decided to hang out a beach bar for lunch, but ended up staying until late afternoon drinking, and then drove the 2 hours back while quite drunk, I have never attepted something like that before and should have been a red flag in more ways than one.

I went back into work that tuesday and the mental hell i had been feeling for months returned just as intesnely as it was before.  I decided that day I was done with everything.  The next morning i woke up feeling the same way, and went through with my attempt.  I emailed in my resignation to my boss, turned my phone off, and woke up about 4 hours later to the cops knocking on my door quite loudly.  I wasn't comatose but quite dizzy and disoriented.  I answered the door and from there thats how I got to where I'm about now. Spent about half the time in the hospital hooked up to Iv medicine and the other half in the psych ward.  Got prescirbed medication, and I have never been medicated before for this.

Looking back, I have always put a tremendous about of pressure on myself.  It's part of my drive, and what makes me decent at my job.  The thing is, I know I am good at what I do, I get paid decent money, but I don't feel that I am, in fact i feel like i'm useless.  I don't ever allow any good thing anyone says to me to build my confidence, but anything that remotely could be construed as a criticism confirms my own thoughts about myself.  This is what I have realized but I do not know how to turn that off.  I have major issues with self-worth and self-esteem.  Although this was my first suicide attempt, I did have a night after a breakup with a girl where I considered it quite a bit, where I considered hanging myself with a jump rope I had from a pull up bar, went as far as feeling the rope on my neck.  But in that moment I talked myself out of it because we had been only dating for 2 months, and that was not a rational reaction to such a short relationship.  

For anyone who has bothered to read this, please offer any advice you may have.  I am seeing the psychiatrist tomorrow morning for the first time since leaving the hospital and am quite nervous about it.",1713234384.0,

Potential-Fall-6311,Should I Reach Back Out?,1,1c5o1sf,0,"So… when I was 18 I joined this forum for people like me with social anxiety. And I spent about a decade there.

The majority of my experience was very very bad. I encountered some of the worst people there, people who really tore me down. Some were also very racist. One guy was stalking his ex-gf, posting revenge porn, and really had it out for me because I was friends with her.

At some point I made a discord server that included myself and “the good ones.” It ran really well and everything was working fine. 

Because I have issues, I still couldn’t separate them from the bad experiences I had from the forum. It all blended together, felt contaminated. It’s been about three years since I was active in that server. 

I was also very ashamed of how I behaved in this community (pre-discord server). I was always getting into fights and said some shitty things. Overshared, people knew my face and address at the time. I’ve been paranoid about harassment from the toxic people there.

My plan was to just disappear and hopefully be forgotten. For whatever reason, I finally peeked inside. I’m pretty sure they’re all concerned I died and one friend I was really close to messaged me.

I might be having a moment of weakness. I’d now like to reach back out, but I don’t want to jeopardize my feeling safe. I don’t want my new socials or anything to get out there and have these two worlds mixing again.

Over time and with therapy, depression has been an in going thing.since I’m always in a state a depression it’s a spectrum that gets pushed to 100 when that week hits. I’m trying to stay afloat mentally but this years been the hardest. Every period feel like I’m ready to plan out dying. I recognize the thought patterns have hold some grace for myself but it’s getting tougher. 

My family I feel suffers from me being unhappy and stressed. They see it but doesn’t stop them from adding to it. I just don’t want to keep thinking of how I’ll do it or when. Deep in my mind it keep blaring like 10 more years and I don’t want that. So the PMDD makes me feel like it’s bipolar but it’s not cause I’m not happy and when I am it’s so few and brief times I just have to enjoy it while I’m feeling it cause I know my mood could shift if I can’t understand something sometimes.

False-Bandicoot9132,"Friend isolated, how can I help?",2,1c5g5lq,5,"  
I'm grappling with how to support a friend who's been ignoring me lately. We used to have open conversations about his depression, and he often reached out to talk when he was feeling low. However, things changed, and he started isolating himself, taking longer to reply, and canceling plans, according to him, he did this to mostly everyone he knew. It somehow fit with his constant feeling of not wanting to burden other people. 

Despite my efforts to reach out and be there for him, he hasn't responded to my messages or calls. We live one hour apart, so visting him not knowing his exact state, was not really an option. So I tried to send him lighthearted stuff, a nice gift to lift his spirits and other random things that reminded me about past conversations. But he doesn't even read or open my texts anymore and several months have passed.  

I read that this behavior can be normal when struggling with depression, so I try not to be mad as he's more likely battling with himself at the moment and I want to be supportive.  

I'm feeling lost about what to do next. Should I continue reaching out or give him space? 

Any advice or similar experiences would be appreciated. Thank you.

For instance, he was asking me to deal with my wife this or that way and expressing disappointment when I was doing differently.

I dropped the therapy at the worst moment and felt very bad that I could not manage to be in the therapy. Then, I started to do high-intensity exercise and live as I wanted, not as other people wanted. I no longer feel bad for a longer time, can handle difficult situations and I know I don't need to meet anybody's expectations.

My point is: even if you feel bad, or you feel you cannot manage therapy, therapists are just people, and you're the same human being, having your right to defend yourself and do whatever you want to do. The therapy was an awful experience and I have a feeling that especially males are not well responding to just talking (there is no sexism there, I mean there is some noticeable difference).

Reaching out feels hard, but I’m in a place where I desperately need to share and seek advice. My therapy, which had become a significant part of my life for nearly two years, ended abruptly, leaving me not only in shock but deeply questioning my worth.  
Throughout the therapy, the dynamics that unfolded - the unease and discomfort during the therapy sessions - felt unsettlingly familiar, echoing the challenging relationships with my abusive parents. This environment brought up and created deep-seated feelings of abandonment, fear and attachment. The sudden termination of our sessions didn't just end my treatment - it felt like a sharp betrayal, intensifying these feelings to an unbearable degree.  
The end of our sessions has brought up intense feelings and reactions that feel eerily familiar to past traumatic experiences, stirring a profound sense of abandonment and distress. Since then, I’ve been struggling with overwhelming emotions, difficulty managing daily life, and a resurgence of old fears and anxieties that I thought I was past. These feelings have spiraled into a deep sense of worthlessness, and at times, I find myself wrestling with thoughts of not wanting to continue.  
I’m struggling to cope with this sense of abandonment and the resurfacing of intense fears and vulnerabilities.

Plus_Conversation391,I’m terrified of my parents,1,1c5hm7g,0,"When I was I kid my mom would never let me go outside and play, instead I got told to stay home and study, my future is so much more important than the temporary fun. After school, she take me to extra class which in my experience is just teaches two step ahead what the school is teaching at the moment but everyone is taking these class so you will have a disadvantage if you don’t.   
So basically my childhood is shit on a desk to study, that was until I turn 12 and got a laptop from my relative, I would spend hours play minecraft, watch anime, read manga, etc. Of course my parents don’t want me to us it to do anything except study so I not allowed to close my room’s door, that’s ok though, I know Alt + Tab so I will just switch to some bullshit math solving page that I prepared whenever I hear footstep. My dad quite uninvolved and will do his best to avoid taking care of any problems so I don’t have much to say.

Not until recently I realized I always have a panic attack when I get a text or call from my parents and ignore them as much as I can.

Everyone talking about homesick and stuff but I don’t feel that much of the different between being alone in my apartment and at home.  
I think that because I don’t feel safe around them, we just don’t really know each other. What worse is that I feel like an ungratefully asshole thinking this way although it is undoubtedly true and it really not helping my depression at all. Is there a way to make the situation better?  
Sorry if the text is hard to read or confusing, I’m a Vietnamese and not really used to writing sentences in English, but I think it would be safer to post on a site not popular in Viet Nam and write it in English. Thanks for sticking with me, any input is appreciated.

SkyNo4282,Don’t know what to do,1,1c5hi8e,0,"

I’ve been struggling recently and realised that I must have been depressed pretty much all my life, ever since my parents broke up. I was a really curious, loud, happy child, but then the fighting started and my home became scary and stressful. My parents fought a lot for a few years before they broke up when I started high school. On the weekends they’d stay in separate rooms and I’d play in my room, not daring to leave the room because that could cause them to leave theirs and see each other and start arguing. 

I was constantly trying to keep the peace. Don’t say anything, don’t disagree, don’t make them feel bad in any way not to anger them. I didn’t feel like I could be anything other than okay, because if I wasn’t happy they weren’t happy and I had to keep them happy. So I never told them when I felt bad, I always pretended I was fine. 

I want to add that they were always very good to me and never intentionally hurt me but I was so scared of them getting in a bad mood and fighting that I never allowed myself to have big outbursts or emotions. 

Fast forward to now and I’m an adult, in university, depressed and anxious, want to drop out because I’m failing everything because I’m too anxious and scared of failure to do any work, but just the thought of having to tell my parents I’m not doing okay the way I’ve been pretending is making me cry. I’ve been pretending I’m doing fine, everything is going great but it’s not. I’m struggling so bad mentally and am still telling them everything is fine. They keep asking me for updates but I’m slacking on everything and I started dreading every text message where I have to lie and reply some excuse why it’s taking longer. 

I’ve realised that this is what I learned as a child when I tried to keep them happy. I know they probably wouldn’t be angry or extremely upset if I told them I’m not feeling well but the thought of doing that feels impossible. It would destroy this image of myself being perfectly fine that’s been 10 years in the making. I feel like I can’t keep this up much longer but the alternative is terrifying. I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. So scared to fail because I feel like there won’t be anyone to be there for me because I’ve built up this image that I don’t need help, that that’s just not something we do in my family. 

All my friends think I’m fine, there’s no one I confided in and I’m scared to. I’m scared they’ll think I’m a lazy failure but I also can’t tell them about being depressed for some reason. I have this horrible fear of telling people how I really feel. I also went to see a therapist once and could not tell her the truth. The idea of telling someone I’m depressed gives me panic attacks. The therapist ended up telling me I’m totally fine! I guess I was great at pretending again. 

Even telling someone I’m physically sick, like having a cold makes me cry! I’m so scared of telling anyone I’m anything else but fine. How the hell do I get out of this?

I can’t finish uni because I’m too scared to ask the teachers for help or tell them I’m struggling. I feel like there’s absolutely no way out here that doesn’t involve an absolute and entire mental breakdown. 

There’s still a chance to finish uni but it’s causing me so much panic that I wish I had the guts to just quit and try something else.

Oh and I also went to see my doctor and told her about my problems, she was the first person I opened up to and I didn’t even tell her that I’m depressed. I just said I’m always tired and unmotivated, and almost started crying in front of her admitting that and she just said, well you just have to get up and be productive even if you’re tired. Great and I waited months for that appointment. ",1713277750.0,

I’m stuck in functional freeze more and more, procrastinating and overeating, once again, after months of rebuilding healthy routines and feeling better. But I’m falling back to the deep pit. This morning a thought of ‘the end game of escaping from reality is suicide.’, which scares me as I haven’t been feeling suicidal for quite some time and have been hoping that this time I’m finally getting better and getting out of it.

Other-Radio-900,I will commit suicide if I don't leave schools,2,1c5c4f7,0,"***(I posted this also somewhere else but I need all the help I can get)***

Okay so need a little help. I'm a 15F and basically last year when I was in year 9 and I decided to move schools for more opportunity/better education for year 10. I decided to move back to my old school (That i haven't attended in 3 years.) At the time this seemed like a good idea, and even though at the time I knew I was leaving my friends/memories, I felt like this was a good idea. Though I wish I didn't feel like this. I regret moving schools.

To make this easier to explain lets name the school I regret moving to School 1 and the school I wanna move back to School 2. Basically as soon as I stepped back into School 1 I felt out of place. The last time I saw these people was in year 6 and they were so much more different, which I knew was to be expected but still it felt weird seeing these people. I still was in contact with my friend group in School 1 so I didn't have to worry about being alone at lunch. The problem is that these friends are not as mature as me and I didn't really realize this until I started hanging out with them. Our interests and hobbies are not really the same and I don't feel happy when I'm with then. Don't get me wrong in primary school these people were so nice and they still are, its just that I don't fit in with them anymore and I can't join a different friend group because I wouldn't fit in with them either. Its a small school so there is only like 50 students in our year level and majority of them are the popular kids which I would not fit in as they are very sporty and extroverted and I'm not. There is also the nerdy/gamer people which is not me at all. There is also some other groups but in this case I just wont fit in at all. I hate feeling like this, I feel alone all the time even though I have people around me. I always miss my old friends and wish that at recess and lunch I was with them at School 2.

Another reason why I wanna move is because the school I go to is an IB program not VCE which I am use to for high school. There is nothing wrong with IB i just find the workload a lot more different and I felt more comfortable doing VCE. I also can't stand how small the school is, idk how to explain it, its like I constantly feel trapped.

I just really miss my old friends, wearing my old uniform, taking my old school bus. Everything I miss everything.

I've only been here for two terms and I already committed suicide twice during those two terms, because I felt like if I was to go all the stress, problems and loneliness would be gone. I tried taking pills the first time, but I just threw them all up and the second time I tried grabbing a knife but I backed out. I also have social anxiety, so I feel like everyone hates me and the world would be a better place without me. And before anyone says give it some time you'll get use to it. I can't get use to this. I cannot stand being here I just hate it. I will not get use to this and the longer I stay here the more I am going up to my breaking point.

Now you might be thinking to yourself, why not tell your parents to move you back? well here is the thing. Finances in my family is not that great and School 1 is very expensive when it comes to school fees, I also had to pay for new uniforms and books to go to this school. I've only been here for two terms and If I tell my parents to move me back to School 2 for next semester, I feel like I just wasted all my parents money and time for no reason. I also made it a big deal last year to move schools even though my parents told me it was expensive. I wish I wasn't so selfish at the time.

I am also scared to tell my parents how I feel and why I wanna move schools, my mum is understanding and my dad is like a basic Indian dad (always angry all the time). I feel like if I tell my mum I'm suicidal and wanna move schools she will feel worries and stressed and if she tells my dad this idk how he would react. I'm not sure if he will be upset at me or stressed. I am also scared if I tell my parents, I will get my hopes up to high and they will tell me I cant move back or my old school will not allow me to come back in term 3.

I know that if I do not move out of this school and go back in term 3 I will not be alive anymore. I really am impatient and I am slowly losing control. I can only hold on for so little and I feel like crying every single minute. If I can't go back to School 2, where I was a lot happier, I am gonna stab myself or do anything so that I won't suffer anymore because I can't keep praying to God every night to kill me in my sleep or waking up every morning and getting ready knowing I am gonna go to a place I hate. If I am able to move schools and go back to my old school next semester, then at least I am able to know that I only have a term left of misery and things will go back to normal when I move back.

I have made a plan to tell my mum how I feel and tell her I'm really suicidal and I wanna move back to schools. Idk how to do it or when is the right time. Please can someone help me on how I can tell my mum this and prepare myself for my dads reaction when my mum tells my dad later on. I am really struggling right now and I pray every single day that I can go back to my old school.",1713260888.0,

No leads on a job and no particular interest in verbally fellating some douchebag so I can get the “opportunity” to spend 30 years in an office wishing for death. I just turned 29, I still live with my mother, and there is nothing left that gives me joy.

For years, I’ve struggled to find a path. Community college, then university. Joyless. Worked in aerospace, in manufacturing, in offices and in the field. Burnt out every time. I don’t have the mental tools to be a real adult, either in a professional or interpersonal sense. I’m bad at making and maintaining friendships, and haven’t ever had a true romantic relationship.

When I was 5, I wound up in a psychiatrist’s office because I was having suicidal thoughts. When I was 16, I tried to jump off a bridge but lost my nerve. The only thing stopping me then was love for my parents. I am their only child, and if I died it would destroy them. So I kept on going, and over time the color kept draining from my world. At some point during covid, I just stopped thinking about the future. I can’t imagine a realistic pathway to happiness, just different ways to experience stress and loneliness. But I can’t leave my folks alone, what kind of monster would that make me? Does wanting to die mean that I don’t love them?

Then I had an epiphany: They did this to me.

They love me, and I love them. They weren’t abusive in any way. They gave me all the resources and attention I could ever have needed. But thirty years ago, they made a decision for selfish reasons. They wanted a baby. They struggled to get pregnant and bought all the baby gear and picked out a name. They went through all that and they never bothered to ask if I wanted to be here. They didn’t give me a choice, so I don’t owe them my existence. When a dog is in pain and living a joyless life, you put that dog down. You don’t force it to live in agony just because losing your pet would be too painful. I have, effectively, been a yuppie couple’s pet my entire life. I can’t feed or take care of myself independently. I have no purpose besides their happiness.

In six weeks, I’m going to walk across the stage and accept my degree. The final boss of my elongated childhood. The thing that middle class boys and girls must do to prove they belong in the club of adults. I’m going to smile for the pictures and listen to the speeches about all the places this piece of paper can take me.

Two years ago, I had a bad depressive episode, from which - as strange as it sounds - I kind of recovered all by myself. One day I touched the bottom, I was fired from my job and I decided to… don’t be like that anymore. I know it sounds weird or stupid, but it worked. I came back to normal, more or less, and I put my life back on tracks.  
Now I suspect that actually I did not fully recover, but only swiped everything under the rug. I look normal, I work, meet people, do activities, I can be funny and extrovert.  
But sometimes when I stop, I feel deep sadness or I start crying uncontrollably for no reason, out of the blue. My life is very emotionally flat, I don’t feel a lot and I don’t care about almost anything. I tell myself that it is just my character, I’m just very cool about most things but in the end I just feel like I'm a very cold person. 

I have big difficulties in picking up hobbies, to the point that I have none. I am not really interested in anything. I have less appetite, but in a normal way. I eat, I want some specific foods but I am immediately full and I grow tired of them. And I am scared of everything, speed, heights, plane, skiing…  
I actively avoid people, never engaging in contacts with others if I don't have to and for this reason, I have no friends. I just don’t feel the need of social contact and I don’t see the point, because most people do not really care.

I’ll try to make this concise so y’all might humour giving me some advice or insight. I’m a 29 year old dude with a “normal” girlfriend, I’ve recently been diagnosed with adhd and been medicated but that’s not helping like I thought it would. 

Since a small boy I’ve been bored out of my fucking mind, and very in my head. I vividly remember consistently being bored at school and protecting adults feelings because their “fun activities” sucked ass. The point of that is to highlight I’ve been negatively geared from primary school, and weirdly self aware. I remember getting embarrassed at the age of 4 in the grocers because of another child acting like a dumbass; just the face of the adult made me feel awful. 

So the crux of my issue. The menial stuff that comes with being in a relationship and being an adult is destroying me, no matter how far inbetween. Double dates sounds lame  as Fuck, family events sounds lame as Fuck, helping my girls random relative move sounds lame as Fuck, driving 3 hours to celebrate Easter with the girls family is torture, getting up at 6 am to be a chauffeur for a 5km run ( like 3 and a bit on freedom units) and stick around to pat my girl on the back for running the equivalent of a lunch break, Fuck that lame shit.  

I hate all this dumbass shit. I hate the small talk, I hate the fact that if you do succumb to a dumbass double date, you just get to sit next to your partner while they re-hash the EXACT SAME CONVERSATION that’s been shared with every friend/relative/couple we’ve seen the last 4 months. How the fuck are their just dudes out in the world that don’t care about this? I can’t shake the feeling it’s ( I mean no offence I’m Australian) completely Fucking retarded. 

Im at a point where I realise I can’t “preserve” my well-being inbetween these dumbass expectations of “adults”. I feel like a fucking joke that I’m expected to play this dumbass game, no one gives a fuck about your mortgage or holiday to the Mykonos, please say something with substance.  However that’s only gonna get worse. 

I’m wondering if I’ve been depressed for over 2 decades because I can’t bounce back inbetween obligations and I feel my negative reaction to them is way way too much. Well it’s too much if I don’t want to die alone. 

Any advice or insight would be cool. If you think im a pussy or something that’s fine, I can run with that. Im just so so tired boys and girls and others, would it be worth trying anti-depressants so I can be the person that im expected to be? Im giving up on this idea I’ll be happy or fulfilled but I can’t give up on my relationship, so if “the suck” doesn’t suck so much with medications I’d love to know.

IIDenisII,I feel like i'm ruining my life,1,1c5ax6s,0,"Sorry for my English, but it's not my first language since I'm Italian.  

I'm a 17-year-old boy, and it's been years since I started feeling like I wasn't okay. I'm struggling to see a point in life; nothing seems to make sense anymore, and those little things that used to cheer me up don't seem to do so anymore.  

I've had a lot of personal shit going on in the past few years, from my costantly-fighting parents (even though it's been a year since they stopped) to problems with myself.  

I'd start by saying that I feel dumb. I can't genuinely think that life is worth living being as stupid as I am. I lack the basic knowledge that all people of my age have, and I act like a kid so many times if I look into all of it in the third person. I never saw myself as an intelligent mind nor as an average person. I just feel like I'm stupid, and people who treat me as if I were someone who really is incapable of discernment just confirm these thoughts of mine.  

Moving on, I even feel like I'm trapped in this life—I really don't want to live—and the thought of stopping existing and getting totally erased from this world comforts me. I don't have suicidal thoughts; death scares me, to be honest, but if I had the chance to leave this world painlessly, I'd take it in the blink of an eye. Summing it up, I feel like I'm condemned to consciousness.   

Plus, my social anxiety and my eating disorder (ARFID) just take me to a point in life where everything socially related is just hard. I never had the chance to eat with someone else unless it was something I liked or with my best friends' family. and my eating disorder has an impact on my body, making me look skinny; some people even used to call me slenderman because of my body and my height (1.90 m).  

The only things keeping me alive today are my family and music. The only thing I felt comforted doing was playing with my band. I've never got to experess my emotions as loudly as with my guitar. I try to put all my rage into it as if it were the only method of communication that I have. I had suicidal thoughts when I got kicked out of my band by my best friends because of some bullshit, such as not taking guitar lessons. But as of now, we have reunited.   

What does the title mean? The title means that every thought mentioned before and a thousand other similar ones take me to a point where I have no motivation to do anything, and no matter how hard I try to do something, these thoughts are always so loud that they leave no space for anything else, as if they were the only thoughts able to speak.   

Plus, the fact that today's society is basically fucked up and it's only going to get worse because of technology and things like that just doesn't motivate me at all. I love nature and the little things that life gives us, but I just can't find comfort in all this shit anymore.   ",1713255804.0,

Why do I fixate on getting worse instead of better? I simply don't understand myself. I do not wish for anything, all my needs and wants are met swiftly. I should be happy. There are people in much worse situations than I, so how do I have any right to feel less than okay? My therapist tells me it's just depression, I cannot change who I am or what my brain chooses to feel - or not to feel. My friends tell me that they're there for me and it'll get better. I have a support system. I have every opportunity and resource to get better, so why don't I try? My body betrays me and feels crippled despite my knowing that I am okay. I am fine. So why do I feel physically and emotionally sick? I do not say that my life is good to throw it in others' faces, I have been in far worse situations in which I have always succeeded in treading water, doing my best with what I had. Now, when I have everything, I can't do it. I can't. I try. I really do, I swear. Depression is a disease, is what I'm told, and I believe it. My disposition is adverse and contrary to my environment. I do not understand myself or others. I do not understand the world in which I live. I cannot swim any longer.

Illustrious_Vast_318,My promise to my parents are the only thing stopping me.,2,1c56nho,0,"My promise to my parents at the hospital to at least wait until their funeral is the only thing staying my hand. They deserve that much for taking care of me. If they threw me out I would have died a long time ago. They're the only family I have left and I'm the last of my family. I have no friends. I have no skills, talents, degrees, or credentials. I'm a socially anxious agoraphobic high school dropout that can't handle any moderate to severe mental and physical stress without mentally and physically just breaking down and most likely going to the hospital thanks to my previous two attempts. Doctors and therapists are just throwing everything and the kitchen sink to see what sticks. I feel like a guinea pig.

I get made fun of, insulted and invalidating 99% of the time by strangers in real life and online when I state the reason why. The reason is that I wanted to be born rich into a loving caring family or winning the lottery or just marrying into money. I don't want to work. I don't want to put any effort in life. I'm a materialistic person. I just want to live a life of comfort and luxury living off the compound interest generated by the wealth. I don't care about relationships with others except my parents. I don't care about spirituality. I don't care about fulfillment in life and I don't care about having a purpose in life. I don't need it.

I wish someone out of 8 billion+ people in the world would just give me between 10 to 100 million dollars. It would legitimately fix everything about my life. I wouldn't have to worry about the sword of Damocles of water, food, shelter, bills, taxes, and more over my head. I wish you could put a prescription for money.

The world and the people living in it has already written me off, calling me a: lazy, parasite, leech, burden to society, useless eater, and many more... Well, you win world. I've utterly given up and just waiting to die. 99% of the strangers I rarely interact with already encourage me to suffer and die when they hear the reason ""why"" I'm like this and when their advises, platitudes, and ""tough love"" fail. That I deserve it for refusing to put the effort into fixing myself. Congratulations world, if you think that will motivate me not to take my own life, it does the complete opposite. I'm sure they'll say good riddance when I die or more likely they won't care and move on. Just another number in a statistic.",1713239689.0,

I feel so stuck. I’m going to bring it up to my therapist but I kind of wanted to get some advice from a wide net of people if possible. I just need help.

Main issues are just that I barely have the energy to do anything but I force myself to go to classes and complete homework no matter how I’m feeling. I only do homework. I only go to classes. My life revolves around two majors and a student research job and I can’t stand the stress of it all anymore. My gf is multiple states away, I have little to no friends in my area, and I’ve been heavily disassociated since 2022.

Anyway I'm a pathetic excuse for a grown man and have no life, to put it mildly. Every day I can't stop thinking of the people that have abandoned me and since made their own lives even better. (They also had much better lives when they knew me.) Every day, I'll literally slow down and feel weighed down by memories of people who left me behind and don't talk to me anymore, most of who ghosted me amongst themselves, for varyingly justified reasons.

One person I met over Reddit who is the kindest person I ever met, and developed a close friendship with, also cut me off one day abruptly, and years later when I sent a text to briefly apologize for my unstable behavior (she had sent me her phone number on a handwritten note she wrote to me) she first lied about who she was, then took back that lie and threatened to call the cops if she ever heard from me again. I actually threw up after that and haven't felt the same since. She works as a therapist, and now I don't trust any therapist. (I've tried therapy previously and didn't like any of the therapists I saw in real life either.) I wish I could genuinely forget about her, but I've never met a nicer or more helpful person, and I know I'm too toxic to do so again.

And in my real life, I've known people that I desperately wish I was like, and people that I'm thankful I'm not like. I know that's normal, but even the people who I'm glad I'm not, do better than me in life, at making friends and making a living. I can't do either. Every job I've ever had I hated. Every day is a unique terror and it never lasts long. I just can't keep up with everyone else. I'm not cut out for this world.

No-Reach-6314,How I ruined my life at the age of 6.,2,1c55usg,7,"Hello, I have been suffering from anxiety and depression since I was 6. No one else in my entire family(from brothers to third cousins) have anxiety or depression so it’s nothing to do with genetics.

When I was in pre school, I was very violent and misbehaved. From ages 3 to 4, I would go to my preschool/daycare and every day, without fail, felt the need to throw chairs. Mostly I did this when I loss in musical chairs or didn’t get my way in some other way.
The only person who ever made me want to act right was my first friend, a fifth grade girl who did after school teaching assisting and would a couple times a week come to the preschool after her own school let out. I never acted up with her there and even was ashamed when my teacher told her how I was when she wasn’t there. Our best conversations were of Dragon Ball Z and her shocked that I didn’t believe in cooties, thinking I was mature for my age. She didn’t really pay any attention to the other kids unless the teacher asked.

I started playing T-Ball when I was 4 and was the best player on my team. We were undefeated my first year at 7-0 record, so the team stayed together for our final year in T-Ball. We went undefeated again with me as the best player. Note: I was only violent in school.

Fast forward to Kindergarten. I am crying the whole way there, acting up, all the way to the classroom. My mom keeps trying to tell me everything will be fine. The teacher opens the door and I walk in, crying like a baby. The teacher shows me to an open chair, and then I see the girl who would be sitting diagonally to me. She had her eyes wide open and seemed shocked to see another kid crying. I instantly stop crying and even wiped my eyes clean out of embarrassment. After sitting down, I start to stare at her through my peripheral vision and realize I had butterflies in my stomach the whole time. When I got home, my mom explained to me I had a crush.

The next day, she was sitting right in front of me. Then I make my move. I get her attention and make a funny face. She bursts out laughing. That day, we became friends. Every day was filled with us working on every single assignment together, acing every vocab and spelling test together since it was allowed in kindergarten, and funny faces to her that made her laugh every single time. What’s weird is that she didn’t say an entire word during this, not once. The only time she talked was to the teachers. First grade starts and we are no longer in the same class, but still had lunch together. On the last day of the first week, I got home and was told we were moving. We ended up moving the same day I was told. Without any way to keep in contact with her and I didn’t even know her last name because how quiet she was.

After moving I start to overeat and gained weight. Any time music was on, I thought of being with her. I got a CD player and my brothers punk rock CDs and would just lay there

Ashamed_Caramel8068,Just found out there was a Rumor about me in a small city. Wanting to move back but not sure now :/,2,1c54pk1,2,"About 2 years ago I used to live in a small touristy town in Texas. About 20,000 people live there and is often visited by lots of tourists. I now live in Washington. 

I was catching up with an old friend that I worked with in the small touristy town of Texas & out of nowhere she told me that there were some rumors going on about me 4 years ago at work and that people had talked about me 4 years ago behind my back. My heart instantly sank, the rumor by the way wasn’t true- she said they said I slept with my boss to get a promotion which I absolutely did not do. I was promoted because I worked extremely hard. (I ended up quitting because I had no work life balance and decided it wasn’t worth it) I had no idea this rumor was even going on behind my back. It blindsided me. I worked with some really mean nasty people back then so I guess it makes sense. I honestly wish she never told me about it, ignorance is bliss. 

I don’t know why she would tell me something I had no clue about from 4 years ago that obviously wasn’t true- I obviously could have gone without knowing this. I lived 4 years just fine not knowing this information. I’m no longer with the company and have moved on. 

I also lived in that city for 2 years after I left the company and never heard one thing about it and it’s a pretty small city. Heavily packed with tourists though. 

I was planning on moving back because I absolutely LOVE it there. I was super excited to finally be able to move back and with my new husband, but after hearing this…..I don’t know if I should move back. Because it’s such a small city where I used to walk around a lot (there’s a lot of cute outdoor shops, restaurants, etc) and I’d hate to run into anyone I used to work with. I don’t want to feel uncomfortable leaving my home fearful that I’m going to run into someone who will be mean/hurtful towards me. My husband also would be working at the farmers market there (they all know what he looks like through social media) and I have a fear that they will bother him/harass him…I might just be overthinking though. 

When I really think about it though…I  did live there after quitting my job for 2 years after, even though it’s a small city. I only ran into people a handful of times, most were pleasant interactions… 2 of the times I ran into some pretty mean people I used to work with and I just pretended I didn’t see them and went about my day. 

So even though it is a small city, with all the tourists that flock there- you don’t run into people you know all the time


Can someone please give me some advice? Really I could use a big mama hug :/ do you think I could move back and it would be okay or do you think it’s better just to not move back out of fear of running into people who have been hurtful towards me

This made me absolutely crumble because I began to take notice of how many people showed signs of liking me as a person and started hyper fixating on the tiniest little things and now I just feel like I’m spiraling out of control and I don’t know what to do anymore. To make matters worse my friend group is pretty harsh with jokes sometimes and it leads to jokes about our physical appearance which obviously doesn’t help. One of my friends makes me feel especially horrible and sometimes I feel like he’s targeting me because he doesn’t do that with my other friends and even seems in general more excited to hang out with them than with me. I feel so ugly and unlovable and I feel like nobody wants to be my friend or love me. I’m starting to hate looking at myself in photos because everyone around me looks so much better than I do and I just look ugly and like I don’t belong. I hate the way I look in candid photos and even the ones where I try to look nice I just look so bad compared to everyone else. I get told I’m pretty sometimes but it’s only by family or family friends and sometimes by my female friends. I’ve only been in 1 relationship ever (the one I’m in) and as far as I’m aware no more than maybe a few people ever showed signs of being interested in me. If they were they never made a move. I’ve been clean from self harm for about a year now I guess but everyday I just feel like I’m closer and closer to starting again and I don’t know what to do. Please if anyone can knock some sense into me or show me some kindness and maybe explain what the hell is going on I’d appreciate it so much I’ve been feeling absolutely miserable and I fear that my suicidal thoughts might return if I keep this up.

surrealdisorder,I would like to talk to someone with similar experiences. ,0,1c58fey,2,"Going to school feels sort of like a social job.
Feeling like I have to act or pretend when I’m around others. I over analyze people and act in a way according to what my brain thinks is best to act like around them.

I do this with everyone. Everyone I know. It just feels like I’m taking on the persons personality. 
Sometimes I get really high on pills because they make me not care and not act but also delirious and causes bad hallucinations. Whenever I go away and I’m isolated i only think negative thoughts about them and I feel disgusted with myself. 

I have people I talk to regularly in person but the thoughts I have about them are all negative and some thoughts are just constant thoughts of attacking them or hurting them because I think they are worthless and not deserving to live.

TheIceMirror,My final letter is done,2,1c53tal,0,"I don’t know when/if I’ll finally get some balls and do it, but I have written my final letter in case I end up going through with it.

Anyway, here’s what I intend to be my final words:

Never had thought I would be sitting here writing such a letter, but that’s what’s happening. I guess my loneliness did finally kill me huh, at least if you’re reading this. Funny how these things work, right? Man, if only I could have known how it would work out…

These past 27 years had a lot of ups and downs. I’ve lived a lot of good stuff, and some bad stuff as well. I think it’s time for me to rest. I think it’s time for me to finally see what’s behind the curtains. I think it’s time to go beyond the veils of this world. 

I’m not incredibly sorrowful or anything like that, but I am done. I feel like I’ve lived whatever I came in here to live for, and now I’m done. I will not prolong my time here just for the sake of others. That doesn’t mean I’m not grateful to the amazing ensemble of people that passed through my life all these years. I’ve had the best friends anyone could ever hope for after all. 

I appreciate what each and every one of you gave me in this life. I hope you all get whatever it is that will make you happy, and that you enjoy yourself with whatever time you have left. All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you. 

I hope that, with time, when you remember me you can share a laugh and a good memory with those around you. I hope that, with time, when you think of me you think of having a blast, of living things you didn’t think you would. I hope that, with time, when you look back at our time together you get a warm, cozy feeling in your gut. I know I would.

There’s a song that I love by Megadeth that’s called A tout le Monde and it goes on about the last words of a dying man. Maybe listen to it after reading this, for me. I wont bore all of you with the entirety of the lyrics though(even if they are indeed entirely true for me), but, there’s a part that I would like to share with everyone. It goes like this:

“So as you read this, know, my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think of me
My body's gone, that's all
A tout le monde
A tout mes amis
Je vous aime
Je dois partir
These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free”

Hi so I'm gonna start off strong w s/h.
I have been clean for a month now,but before that I was clean for awhile. It's hard to explain what happened there so I won't go into that but it happened. Before I did it I was feeling really.... down, nostalgic, and whatever else you would call it. I used to S/H everyday I also went through a lot as a young kid and I seriously mean a lot- the people (most people) with personality disorders (depending on the disorder) get what I mean when I say that- I have been doing so well I found someone who treats me really good and who has helped me through so much- I love them endlessly and I don't want to hurt them at all but how do I explain to them that despite my love for them and how much I appreciate them that I still want to torture myself- That sounds worse than it is. Since I stopped this past month I have been trying so hard to resist the urge to get back on my old reddit communities that triggered me, I have resisted the urge to physical self destruct, I have resisted making myself suffer in many way but I can't anymore- It's all I think about. I wanna c^+ I wanna help people with things that trigger me, I stopped asking people to stop what they're talking about if it triggers me, I wanna listen to things that trigger me, I basically wanna trigger myself but most of all I wanna c^+ I wanna help people. All i can think about is s/h. Now there are 2 things I left out- 1) I am a competitive dancer who is in the studio everyday and if you know anything about competitive dance u spend so much time at practice you get spray or lotion tans and you go to competition in a costume that you do not get pick- meaning you don't get to choose what it covers and with the spray tans you have to be naked and someone else tans you. 2) I am part of a D.I.D. system and I'm that this personality disorder gets A LOt of bad wrap and that it's SEVERELY misunderstood and it is faked so so so often it's disgusting. I am in the process of getting diagnosed but while still technically being a minor I have to wait a few more months to get official testing but I see a lot of professionals and they all agree ( we have been at this for a few years now) now the reason why this is relevant is because I'm not sure if the reason i'm feeling this way has to do with this like a mimic or a persecutor and my professionals and i talk about this a lot but this isn't what i was expecting or prepared for and i can't control shit- essentially idk what's going on and i know i need the help for it im just not sure- also because im a minor my guardians do not know and we dont plan on telling them for ..... good reason which is part of the reason i cant get properly treated or tested. I may be in the wrong sub but im posting this many places. anyway, bottom line i wanna c^+ and i wanna self sabotage and i know i cant rlly c^+ rn because it is comp season but i can self sabotage and i need to know why i feel this way. 

Thank you if you actually read anything. This was long so I apologize for that. Even if you don't know anything commenting a sub is could visit someone i could text on here or if you just share this with someone you may think could help that is as much help as i could ask for so thank you. We appreciate you!

After being very isolated in my “homeschooled” childhood, I trained myself in piano and became a music instructor. I worked so hard since I had a poor education and had to find something to do. I didn’t make a ton of money, but I had my foot in the door of a career I always dreamed of.

Anyway, during my year long stint of instructing where I worked, I was groomed by a much older coworker due to my naivety. I took my first edible ever, it was WAY too strong, and I was raped by them during my delirious state. This person even bragged about it, but my boss found out it was rape and they were fired. I had to quit due to the trauma of the situation.

I also had my first real relationship during that time, former best friend turned partner. We shared many songs together, I even wrote songs for this person. Sadly, I got cheated on and dumped/taken back 4 times while everything else was happening. Kinda ruined music for me too.

I had one talent, I was actually very good at music if I do say so myself. Doesn’t matter now though, I spiral into gloom whenever I try to play songs now.

 They say no to care about others and to find self love. But it's impossible. What I need is someone else to love me. Romantically. But that's impossible isn't it? Who on earth would love someone like me? Probably someone I wouldn't even want to be with.

So what can I do? What can I possibly do? I try, and try, and try, and try. But no matter how many times I try, I fail. That's it. That's me. The failure of the family. That's what it feels like I was meant to be.",1713189461.0,

I asked her out solely because I was panicking. She said no. It was too late. She suggested we stay friends, I thought that was a bad idea, but never said it.

Year 10 comes around, and I still haven't gotten over her. I decide I'm going to go to the gym and distance myself from her because she's rotting my brain. First day I go there, she's there. Might I add I also had an English class with her, distancing myself was already off to a bad start. So at the gym, I'm feeling self conscious because I'm weak and thin and pathetic and don't want to look stupid. I leave fairly quickly, but during that time she openly tried to communicate with me, even offered to help fix my dead lift, to which I declined.

I never went back to that gym.

So the semester wears on, and I'm feeling shitter and shitter. Bus rides home, I think about her. Before basketball games, I think about her. In the toilet, I think about her. I know, edgy teenage bullshit, but it was wearing me down and life was becoming so much more mundane for me.

Semester ends.

This time, I don't have class with her.

Over this time, she stops talking to me as much. Strangely, I noticed that once or twice she tried to, but thought twice and ignored me. This was good, right? Wrong, for some dumb fucking reason, I wanted to talk to her, to be friends with her, to be close to her. Even though every time she got a new boyfriend that year it ripped me limb from limb, I couldn't stop feeling that way. At one point she dated my mate, and it shred me so bad I may as well have been dead already. It ended rather quickly. The year ends, and I'm at my lowest ever, I feel so bad and so empty. Often I contemplated what it would be like to just not exist.

Year 11 - this year - rolls around. 

I go back to school, with a new objective, distancing didn't work, I still can't get over her. I decide I should try and be a good friend again. The first week of school passes and I started snapping her again. Bad idea. I start checking this disease of an app every three minutes desperate for a reply, to none. That was term one, term two rolls around. This time, I feel so bad I decide I need to open up to someone, and what better decision than to open up to her? Someone who's experienced depression first hand? She gives me some advice, I feel slightly better. This was a few days ago. Today, I'm at basketball training, after having earlier overcome my seriously bad social anxiety to say hi to her. At basketball training, my mate, the one who dated her, reveals that he broke up with his girlfriend, and already has another.

He's back with Abby.

Holy fucking shit.

I've just been crying my eyes out in a toilet, and have just brought my suicide date forward. 

Please, I'm begging anyone, give me something, anything, that will make me feel okay again. Because I've tried anything and everything for two whole years and can't make any progress. Hobbies, music, talking, chores, busying myself, anything you can name I've probably done. Therapy is not happening, I'm not opening up to anyone else, not a chance.

In a moment of desperation, I even reached out to his mom (who doesn't even know me), which I regret. We tried to reconcile, but he expressed that he found me too needy and co-dependent, and ultimately, he ended things, citing his own personal issues and the need for space. I was deeply invested in this relationship, especially since I lost my virginity to him. This was all in a span of one month, and I truly liked him and wanted to be with him for the long term.

throwaway8922972,Needing some honest advice on coming off anti depressants after being on them for 14 years. ,1,1c55a4e,1,"Hello everyone, 

I’m just looking for a little advice here. I’ve been on anti depressants for 14 years I’m (M26) now. I’m in the process of coming off them, and I actually did come off them fully a week ago and basically I ended up just having some whole crazy psychotic episode, I had loads of symptoms like: Headaches 

Itchy 

Confused, not able to understand things, memory isn’t working properly 

Irritable 

Crying/ hyperventilating a lot

Heart palpitations, vein on left of neck palpitates with my heart. My ears ring when it palpitates and my vision blurs very slightly for a split second. 

Parts of my body that must be weaker or worn out

Paranoid, think everyone is out to get me/ conspiring against me 

Nightmares 

Sweating during the night ( sleeping with a towel to wipe off sweat) 

Too hot or too cold

Nihilistic thinking, feeling hopeless and that there is no point or purpose in my life. 

I spent all my months money in a week (£2,500), and I don’t really understand how I managed it. My girlfriend suspects in hindsight that I’ve probably been having some type of psychiatric episode for about two weeks from coming off the medication and now that I’m fully off it, it has tipped me over the edge. 

I’ve started taking the Venlafaxine again at the lowest dose which is 37.5mg and all the horrible side effects have gone away now. But I do not want to be on it. I’ve also been able to recently get a medical cannabis prescription (I’m in the United Kingdom) and that’s really helped me a lot with my depression and anxiety. 

When this all came to a head on Friday, my GP called my psychiatrist and the psychiatrist totally freaked out and has prescribed me diazepam that I should have between today - Wednesday. 

But I guess what I’m asking is, does anyone have any recommendations to get off Venlafaxine safely and whilst considering the other medicines I take. 

Thanks ",1713235474.0,

now im bedrotting everyday going actually crazy and since final uni deadlines will be soon, i keep thinking of going even though i have no interest in any of the subjects for a career and honestly can’t see myself living past early twenties. i only want to go because i need to be around people even just to sit by someone in a class it forces people to care even just a bit about you, if you’re alive or not a teacher or peer will notice. but that’s a very expensive dumb thing to do, enroll in uni, just to be part of people again. or is it worth it if it gets me out of this? or am i idealizing uni and it’s actually very depressing + will make me worse?

Its happened twice recently where people pry into who I am and it just unleashes so much negative emotion. It first happened when I was dating a girl (who I really liked, shes going through depression too, so she wanted some space for now, I hope she comes back), but when she asked more and more about me, and told more and more about herself, I just felt like such a pathetic loser. This chick is 4 years younger than me and has experienced so much. She has people in her life that constantly look after her. She's had so many friends, family, and past boyfriends, it just hurt not being able to relate to any of it.

Next one happened today. My supervisor was eating lunch and stopped me while I was walking by. She just started rambling on about her weekend, and then the subject changed a few times, but it eventually turned to me and my future plans. Like if she only knew the only plan I have is to end it all. She was asking about careers, friends, moving out, family, etc. All things I avoid thinking about because it makes me want to do bad things to myself. She was really nice asking me about these things, but its like she opened a lid and all my pressurized emotions bursted out. I feel like crying when those conversations happen. 

I don't suppose anyone has any advice. Yeah yeah, self love. Easier said than done.

I’ve always been indecisive when it comes to little things too like what to order for food, what to wear, etc. A therapist I was seeing last year told me indecisiveness is a symptom of depression which I had never considered before. She talked me into taking lexapro which I’ve generally been happy with. It seemed to work its best in the beginning, whereas now it still works but I also just kinda feel numb about life and feel like I’m just getting through it, barely managing but enough to be functional.

Euphoric_Plantain24,Young man with no hope for the future ,0,1c548lw,2,"Reasons for my hopelessness as a 23 year old man

1. terrible economy/minimal job prospects
Ever since graduating from college, I can’t even get an interview in my field.  Jobs in journalism, social media management, and marketing have hundreds of applicants so the likelihood of getting a call back is slim.  Plus, I don’t even know if I’d ever be considered with the DEI politics in the workforce.  All of the jobs that are interested in me are in retail or fast food.  Outside of possibly pursuing sales, my opportunities are dead end minimum wage jobs.  I would be open to entrepreneurship, but I don’t know what I’d want to do.  I have a YouTube channel that makes me money, but I have no clue how to make it into a full-time career.  In order to make $50K a year, I would need to achieve 10 million views.  In my entire channel history (9 years), I have 8 million.  That is honestly my dream job.  I love spending time creating entertaining videos especially as it relates to one of my interests. If it were up to me, I would devote my entire life to it.  However, it s depressing that I will likely never make enough money to where I can create content full-time and be my own boss.

One YouTuber suggested to get a 9-5 job to figure that out.  LOL, I can’t even get one in the first place.  

With how inflation is skyrocketing, I don’t see myself ever moving out.  In all likelihood, I will just inherit my mom and dad’s stuff when they die.  Pretty pathetic.  

2. No options with women
In modern society, women have been liberated from their gender roles but still expect men to be traditional.  I know in order to find a quality woman, I need to make a lot of money to even have a shot because of hoeflation.  Most women of all economic backgrounds won’t consider dating a lower class man that works minimum wage.  Which you’re seeing in statistics.

Most young men in America are single and most women are in relationships.  Basically it is two guys fighting for one girl on average.  IDK if it is them sharing top men or dating older men, but it shows that they value established men.  If there are good girls out there, they likely found someone young and are already married.  At least that’s what happens in rural areas.

Honestly, I’m just now coping with the fact that I will likely die a virgin.  I have no confidence in where my life is going, so how will I ever have confidence to attract women?

3. Lack of meritocracy 
My dad worked for people that rewarded people for working hard.  I was instilled with those values, so I was in for the culture shock that hard work isn’t valued anymore.  Part of it is because of the economy and how people with money can get a lot further.  Example, look at auto racing and how a lot more drivers are hired because they bring sponsorship instead of talent.  Plus, the rise of wokeness and DEI might lead to some companies valuing people for jobs because of race and/or gender.  

4. Society’s lack of interest in fixing these issues
I honestly think there’s a hidden agenda in America to create an entire generation of young men that feel hopeless and expendable.  After all, the more than men are depressed and complacent the more that the people in charge can control society.  US politics don’t focus on issues that young men are facing.  No instead we only care about the issues women and boomers are facing.  My boomer parents are doing really well, but our politicians are more worried about their 401K than helping people that are going to be in the workforce for the next few decades.  

I’m fed up with society not understanding or caring how hard it is to establish yourself as a young man and acting like this is the 50s.

Back in the 50s, being a good man in America could easily get you a decent house, a wife, a solid career and income, plus a sense of purpose.

Now it seems like being a good man gets you minimum wage work, no romantic interest from women, little free time to pursue your ambitions, crippling addictions and depression.

Hi everyone.

I feel very low right now. Not suicidal and no harmful ideations. I just feel overwhelmed, sad, and stuck. 

I was watching this limited series on Netflix called Baby Reindeer, and it brought up some deep feelings. Feelings of shame, disgust, and all that comes with sexual abuse. 

I've already been feeling super low due to hating my job and not knowing what the hell to do instead. I'm in this desperation to run the f@ck away but IDK WHERE TO EVEN RUN!!! I wish I was rich and could just hide away at some sort of wellness retreat to get my feet back on the ground. It's just not a feasible option. 

I've been sexually abused at all stages of my life (almost 30 now), have been diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy, and am now an obese, pre-diabetic, potato. 

I used to be a D1 Volleyball player. I always loved being strong but I have always thought I was overweight and that, that made me an ugly person inside and out. I am trying to learn how to accept myself and love who I am, despite what has been done to me and the choices I made when I was in very dark places. 

It's hard. Knowing what I've done in the past to try and fill the voids that were created from being taken advantage of, stomped on, and pushed down. I just want to SCREAM and punch walls and AHHHHH idk!!! I feel like I'm crawling in my own skin (I finally understand that).

I’ve been dealing with depression on and off for the last 7 years. However, my depression has gotten really bad these last two years.

shinigamijewels,does it get better?,1,1c51eq2,1,"Hi friends, I’m 22 yrs old and I’ve felt empty for as long as I can remember. I’ve been on an antidepressant journey with my primary care doctor (not a psychiatrist) since I was 18. I live in a VERY small town with not many resources. I’ve tried about every antidepressant on the market and they just will not work for me. I was on 275 mg of venlafaxine and it was kinda working?? I guess idk I got off it last year and things were fine until my best friend died. I have never felt this empty or guilty. My doctor put me on mirtazapine and idk if it’s my meds or just my situation but I have never been this suicidal. I can’t keep up with this much longer. Mirtazapine isn’t working and my doctor ended up quitting as well as my therapist :/ I have an appointment with a new doctor on Friday but idk guys, am I going to feel this empty forever? Will it get better? I’m trying to do better for myself I want to start school soon so i can have something to look forward to but fuck guys I don’t want to be the shell of a person forever.

TurnipLast2885,My Job Makes Me Depressed,1,1c50tsv,0,"I know, I’m so unique, I don’t like job and it’s making me very unhappy. But, I’m not in a place where I can quit yet, I’m hoping I will be in 60-90 days and am looking for ways to cope until then.

So, some background, I work for my sister’s company. Initially, this job got me out of a dark place (God, just admitting makes me feel like I’m the problem). My previous employer paid very little, made me cry IN PUBLIC by yelling at me, dismissed my feelings about how he treated me, etc. I was drinking very heavily and would have absolutely been considered an alcoholic. So this job, being that it paid more, had better benefits, and that I would be working for my sister helped me financially as well as sober up so I didn’t embarrass her. 

Recently, we got into a “discussion” about work after hours at what was supposed to be a family dinner. I ended up crying (I promise I’m not a massive crybaby. I’ve only cried from a workplace review twice, my previous boss and now my sister, probably because in both cases the yelling/discussion came at moments when my guard was down and not expecting to hear my performance be brutally evaluated with no room to defend myself). Before this, I knew I wasn’t very happy in my position but I was trying to tough it out. Now, I know it’s time for me to seek employment elsewhere. But I have an extended vacation coming up in a few weeks and don’t want to leave until a few weeks after that, so June or July.

The problem is that I feel so depressed whenever I’m here. Like, it’s been over 2 weeks since the discussion and I probably think about how nice it would be to suffer a heart attack while at my desk so I could die or be hospitalized. But, my depression is solely limited to work. I hung out with friends this past weekend and had a great time. I never thought about wanting to die and I often don’t when I’m at home. It’s just when I’m at work.

So TLDR, does anyone have any tips to help me get into the right mindset while at work? I mean, it’s only another 40 days til my vacation and then 60 days from when I get back of when I’ll put in my 2 weeks. I can do this. I just don’t want to suicidal that whole time (minus when I’m on vacation)

RoundRespondRedRover,How do you cope with staring into the future of 30-40 more years on earth?,1,1c50hxx,0,"I am 38 looking for some thoughts from others. I wasn't like this until this past fall. My life sorta came crashing down with career-ending things. I was an artist. Now I'm just a normie. My pursuit of the arts set my regular career back about 10 years. So now I'm nearly 40 and working an entry-level tech job. I have no ambition or energy or real joy in life anymore. I used to find hope in the future. Now I just see a downward trajectory into the grave. Ideally, I think I would have died last fall but I held on because I'm too scared to die. So now I just wake up at the crack of down and go to a job I'm miserable at each day to ensure I don't starve and have nothing to look forward to. I have a girlfriend but I sorta can't respect someone who believes in me or loves me or whatever it is she sees in me. The old joke of ""I can't date someone who's standards are low enough they'd date me."" I have thought maybe having kids would bring some meaning to my life, but I just have this belief that life is miserable and nothing but suffering and creating a new life would be a real dick thing to do because I'd be involuntarily subjecting them to this shit. Adopting would maybe be a way to go, to try my best to ""rescue"" someone from a shit life in the foster system, but just the psychology of it all kind makes me feel like an unfit father. Plus I don't think they'd let me adopt because I've got low self esteem, a bankruptcy on my record, and a mental health history. Probably can find a criminal background if you dig hard enough. And who knows what the cost of adoption even is. To address the flow of ""Dude, you need therapy"" comments - I do see a therapist. Anyways, how do you cope? Also, please don't say to smoke weed.

I struggle with loss of pleasure, and loss of appetite.

I feel terrible that I have let this happen again. A battle I have in my life is always trying to do the most to create life out of darkness. I have this terrible tunnel vision where all I can see is the world around me, and I feel so trapped sometimes(most of the time). I feel terrible that I have made yet another decision which cut m off from that feeling of life and light.

I made a decision to drop an important course last year I was taking , or what i hoped to take to create websites, because the course seemed too expensive at the time. after that, and a few other personal failures, I have become really shuddered. I thought I knew brokenness but this is another level. I feel so mad at myself for making another decision and letting it become like this.

BareVanillaVS,Please Let Me Out,1,1c4zzpf,0,"Emptiness is all I have felt the past 2 years
I am the only one around to dry my tears
The loneliness eats at me as if it were a pack of maggots attracted to death
I swallow the rest of the bottle and lay down to rest
But when morning comes I'm still here
Staring up at the ceiling with my makeup smeared
I can't do this anymore, I just know I can't
And all you stupid cunts say the same chant
""Life's worth living, please just wait it out!""
Fuck you and go to hell you pathetic clown
My mind is a prison, and I want to escape
But I always remember after the drugs I take
I'm too far gone now, there's nothing you can do for me
I used to be so full of light and so carefree
I lay awake at night, wondering if I'll ever love again
And then the suicidal thoughts come in
I don't want to be here, can't you see?
Stop fucking pitying me
I'll grab a noose and tie it around my neck
Or maybe I'll lay down in the railroad and hope I get into a trainwreck
Don't call me selfish, I never asked to be born
If I want to take my own life, you shouldn't look at me in scorn
Mom and Dad, your daughter doesn't want to breathe
Please everyone leave me alone so I can grieve
I think I need a lobotomy, my head has never felt right
Please stop worrying about me, everything will be alright
When I leave this world I know my final moments will be in bliss
I think of all the times I was happy, and those memories are surely missed
But when I think about death I smile and grin
Mr. Grim Reaper, please take me away so I can feel peace again
I've tried and tried to reach you repeatedly 
All these things I feel, I can't keep hiding them secretrly
People don't want to be around me like they used to
I wouldn't want to either knowing what I've turned into
Anger and hatred fill my soul
In this world, you've got to learn to be cold
Now I hate this fucking planet
I want to bash your head in with a goddamn rock until you're one with the granite
I don't care anymore, I'll help turn this world to shit
And if you don't fucking like that you can go get your wrists slit
 I feel so fake, hiding my real face behind this anguish and pain
If you were me you'd also go fucking insane
I don't know who I am, I sit and stare at the clock
Hours go by as I daydream about being fodder in a box
I feel so lifeless, I'll do anything for the rush
Lying and hurting people I love just 'cause
I hate feeling close to people now, I really do
Because in whatever ways you can hurt me, I must first do to you
I admit I'm selfish now, but can you blame me?
I've always been the therapist friend yet no one else to save me
Please, everyone, stop telling me your problems because I don't give a fuck
I hate being around people now, I want to be locked up in a bunk
But it's so confusing to me, it really is

I have this painful feeling, like I have been done dirty. Like this is a mean joke played on me.

I see other people. Many of them. Young too. They drive expensive cars, buy beautiful stuff and have no care about anything. I do not necessarily envy them, but when I look at myself compared to them, I feel so insignificant, despite all my intelligence and reasoning. I feel like I am lower than them, in a way.

My family is not poor, but it is not rich either. I had no choice but to be born in it. My parents also have this unexplainable desire to not progress in life, this has hindered them a lot, and as much as I have tried to change that for the better, it did not change much. I feel like I have been given a bad and unfair start at life. I know other people may have that too, but this does not make it any more right.

Sometimes, this feeling brings rage, but other times, the more intense ones, it brings deep sadness and I completely crash. It all seems so pointless to me. My life feels like it was made for me to lose and suffer for it.

kvs1707,Bad trip,6,1c4m72f,2,"Before talking about the trip I would like to give little bit of background. Im 27 yo. I discovered porn when I was 13. I have been watching soft porn ever since. I watched lesbian porn. Most of the times YouTube is enough for me. I gravitate towards incest stuff.
From jan 1st I went on a nofap streak and stayed away from mastrubation and porn for 55 days. My longest conscious streak. I slipped into my old habits. I did 2 streaks of 13 and 10 days after that. Today is my day 7, I didn’t wanted to do it before I meet my girlfriend. I met her on weekend in a hotel room. We wanted to go third base as I’m a virgin. But she got her periods and we shifted primarily to our second plan which was to get high. I’m well versed in getting high department but she was doing it for the first time.
THE BAD TRIP
As she was doing it for the first time she got paranoid very quickly. It infected me and I got paranoid too. I was trying to calm her down. She was roaming all over in the room. I took her to bed and asked her to sleep. It was difficult for her to sleep and for me as well. She came close to me and tried to kiss me. When I was young I used to sleep in my parents room which is normal in our country as there is no space in our house. This is when I was around 10, I was really fascinated by kissing on the lips, kissing on the lips is not at all common, in fact it is considered taboo. I used to try to kiss my mother on her lips.
It was all blurry and dark in the room. And when my girlfriend tried to kiss me, I was in my childhood again. I felt very uncomfortable as the silhouette of my girlfriend was looking exactly like my mother. And I couldn’t stop my girlfriend because she had become very insecure and scared. If I stopped her she would have thought that I don’t love her. I stayed in bed still, waiting for the nightmare to end. We decided to take a bath because we thought it would make us feel better. We were completely naked in the shower and all I could think of was the porn scenes I saw. Which made me feel very dirty and bad for my girlfriend. She tried to kiss me there too but I was very reluctant. After the bath we slept it off and felt better. But we were both shaken by the trip. I know I’m still in shock.
I feel very guilty, very bad about myself. I feel like a predator, a criminal. I was depressed for 5 years, after quitting smoking weed and now alcohol for 1 n half years now Im feeling very good. At least I had the confidence that I can tackle any situation. But since this incident I have been shaken to my core. And I’m feeling confident. I’m feeling like I used to when I was depressed.

It’s like one day I think I’m getting better and the next I am super low, hating everything about myself and my life.
I feel so alone, I don’t know who to turn to for help, I'm so disgusted with myself, and it feels like I'm only getting worse. Deep down i just want someone to love me and care about me and it’s so frustrating that I’ll never have that. That i don't deserve that because I'm mentally ill. And its not just lows anymore.
It’s like one day I think I’m getting better and the next I am super depressed, hating everything about myself and my life. I dont feel okay within myself anymore.
I feel so ashamed that I am still alive. And I feel like it’s selfish for me to be here, that I’m only hurting those I care about. And sometimes I wish I never tried to make friends at all and wish that i didnt have anyone who cared about me as it would only hurt them as I left.
But for the most part I feel like I’m going crazy. I’m more impulsive when it comes to people acting on my feelings and I keep spending money when I tell myself not too. I don’t know what’s going on. I’m doing everything right I go to therapy, group therapy, am on medications, am taking proper supplements but I’m not getting any better. I make appointments with my doctor and I tell her I’m not okay but all she can do is up my dosage, and I need more than that. I need help, I am losing my mind and I can’t keep living like this.

Eventually it dawned on my mother in law that she recognized it, I stopped taking those painkillers in December, and haven’t had a similar episode since.

ConfidentVanilla3499,Feeling lost and not knowing how to focus on myself long term,1,1c4x8ov,2,"
Always been like this, simply did what I was told in life. Go to school, do your best, be nice, have good grades, if you get a bad grade fix it, etc.

Never had any specific goals/plans or thought about future and even if I did I was always unsure bc it felt like everything interest me and nothing interest me. Then somehow chose (stumbled) onto college and did the same thing. Focused on doing my best, passing the exams, worked part time. I realize now it was all simply a way to stay busy and distract myself since the first time I felt like this was at the end of high school.

With jobs, never had a preference, as long as it was making me money. It was always “just tell me what to do and I’ll do it”. Mostly did retail and similar jobs, but I always got annoyed after few months when I got some money and it was no longer just the goal to make money. Felt like I was selling myself short and could do more, but then when I had to move on and figure out what it was I wanted long term, I would get uncertain and unable to plan and focus again. Even if I sat down and thought about what could be good for me long term, I have trouble staying focused and disciplined long enough. Like I don’t truly believe it’ll happen, not sure. It kinda feels like I need deadlines and someone telling me what to do and when to be able to stick with it long term.

Is this because of trauma? Emotional neglect? Family who criticized me, never encouraged and supported me? Mom who never allowed me to do things myself?
Lack of parenting and direction overall in life? Depression? Self sabotage? Not truly believing I could be happy? Watching my mom living (or more like surviving) in similar way?

 one of the few posts i'll probably ever post. I am kind of at a loss. Generally everything can be seen from the positive or the negative side. I guess i tend to be rather negative.

Don't really know where to post this into but i think im depressed onve more so ill post it here.

5-6 years ago i used to be in a depressive episode because back then gf left me and I didnt see any value in life. After that i went to therapy, tried different antidepressants and went to a mental clinic, eventually it helped like after 1-2 years. Now im in the end of my bachelors degree of a good uni in europe. I dont feel any attachment to my mom and i simultaneonsly have to work and finish univeristy.

My current problem kinda is just that in high school i used to view life as meaningless. I got over that. But now im back at that, just worse. Currently I'm just so stressed out from studying 100% and working % whily simultaneolsy having this ideal view of myself (being the best boyfriend, going to gym, having good health). The past 3 weeks im back in my depression. I drink alcohol at everyy occasion, i dont care so much about anything but i kind of dont know what to do. I don't want to be an ordinary person, If I lvie this shit life (even if its privileed) I'd want to at least be happy but i dont see any reason. What's the reason of being alive? some may say being happy is the reason. But what's the reason of being happy? Isn't it just a value placed upon us like everything else? Is there anything inherently individual? I dont get it how other people dont think about it. How does this world work??? Probably most other people though of this? i dont get it.

Generally what do you think about what i wrote and what are your thoughts abour life and society?

They told me they'll call when a spot is free, usually around 4-6 weeks(which is normal and I thought I could handle that)

Today I had therapy. I talked to my therapist about how much this annoys me that I've been waiting for 6 weeks already and didn't get a call so she suggested I call the clinic during our session, in case they say i need to wait another 4-6 weeks and crumble emotionally. They told me I should expect a call in around 4 weeks. Idk man 10 weeks(let's be honest if not more) isn't 4-6 weeks and I know it's not really their fault but I'm in desperate need of this. 

The truth is I could BARELY handle the waiting time already. Well at least now I know how long I can expect to torture myself. There isn't even anything else I can do but wait.

alternate_darkside,My depression story,1,1c4v9ml,1,"Hey, I'm not necessarily looking for feedback. I just need somewhere to say all this out loud. I've been holding it back too much lately. Feel free to comment if you like. No TL:DR...

Even though there are people and events I would like to blame for my depression and SI, this story actually starts many years back, with no discernable trigger. 

The first memories I have of being suicidal, I was only 8 years old. When I told an adult in my life, I was promptly told not to, because I would go to hell. Then I was torn. Torn between wanting out of this life, and being afraid of eternal torment. 

I have a memory from somewhere in the couple of years that followed of sitting in the living room, playing with Legos and listening to the radio. Specifically listening to a Christian call in radio show to answer questions about the faith. Listening in hopes that I would hear if suicide actually sent you to hell or not. I had to listen a lot longer than I anticipated, but I had no other recourse. I definitely couldn't trust the adults in my life. Months of listening and one day my question was finally answered: no, you are not sent to hell just because you commit suicide. I was relieved, surely this man who was smart enough to have his own radio program was right. Surely he knew more than some of the adult Christians around me.  

The story fades for a few years. There are large chunks of my childhood that I can't remember, but that's a different story. This story resumes when I was jolted into life or death responsibilities at age 13 by a diabetes diagnosis. Type 1. Insulin dependent. For the rest of my life. 

I don't directly blame the healthcare professionals I encountered. Some were great. But the overwhelming general consensus is that I would be dead by age 40 because of this disease. Certainly have multiple amputations. Possibly lose an eye. Much of this was due to really poor diabetes education in rural areas. Some of it was due to people trying to shock me into being a good diabetic and taking care of myself. 

But 13 year old me didn't know enough to know better. This started another spiral. Sure there were other things in my life that looked great, but I was secretly drowning. I didn't know to ask for help, and even If I had, did those around me know enough to help. Again, this is in part due to poor health education. Both diabetes and mental health. 

I can recall a decent amount of my teen years, but many of my memories are in gray scale. Usually in 6 month blocks of time. I possibly had some kind of bipolar depression going on, but who knows. It was over 15 years later when I finally talked about it with a therapist, and she thought a bipolar thing was possible, but very hard to diagnose in retrospect,  that far back. 

It was somewhere in my teen years that I started having a recurring dream. In this dream, I died at age 22. In some ways this was a relief, because hey, no amputations or lost eyes. In these dreams I usually died from suicide, but not always. I've never told a living soul that detail. 

There was one occasion in highschool where I took way too much insulin. Although it's one of the memories that's very blurry, it's at least in color. I honestly can't remember if it was intentional for a suicide attempt or not. I do remember sitting up all night eating sugar and fretting about what the very last book I read before I died would be. 

College was in the cold dark north, and that brought it's own kind of depression. My roommate told me I was depressed. I told him I was just tired. I was sleeping 12-16 hours a day, and failing classes. I took a couple semesters off. The weather was better, but not the depression. Between ages 19 and 21 I had several occasions where I was very close to committing suicide. Gun in hand. Or razor blade ready. I gave up on learning to tie a proper noose. It had to be proper. I'll be damned if I hang myself with some halfway done noose.

At 22 I got a job doing power plant outage work. In the north east. More cold and dark. But I worked so many hours in a week that I didn't have enough mental capacity to be depressed. I was a zombie. 
For half the year I would work, and then go back to college to try to finish my degree. A cycle of zombie to depression, zombie to depression emerged. And stayed. 

I'm one credit hour away from finishing my degree. That's now been a decade plus and I'll never go back to that part of the country. There's dark spirits there. Or some sort of heavy presence. I don't know, can't explain it. 

Somewhere between age 20 and 24 I have a memory or having a 44 magnum to my head. I don't even own a 44 magnum. So I can't explain that one. I feel like it was in May and I was sweaty. 

I got a better job. Although I had a couple of close calls at age 24. Got extremely depressed for an indeterminate reason. You know it is severe when someone who is chronically depressed says it is bad. I'm honestly still surprised I survived that fall and winter. 

The job distracted me for a while. But it also brought to light my anxiety problem. After a couple counselors did very little to move the needle, I finally sought chemical help. The psychiatrist prescribed antidepressants. And my dose kept climbing. I tried several. Finally landed on a max dose of two different antidepressants in combination. I no longer felt depressed, but I no longer felt human either. I was a whole different kind of zombie

So I kept that up for a year. It was the first time I can remember not crying on vacation because of guilt and panic attacks because I wasn't productive. Then I had to stop all my meds for a week when I had COVID and took a medicine to fight it. I never restarted my anti depressants. I felt fine for a while, but slowly slid back into depression.

Now the meds are ramping up again. 
And feel like they are doing absolutely nothing. 

One of the greatest struggles is not being able to talk about my depression and SI. People often say: ""if you are sad/ depressed/ suicidal talk to me, I'm here for you"".
But in reality, when they see a sliver of the mental burden I carry, they melt down and I have to be strong for them. I have to comfort them and tell them it's ok. It's kinda messed up. 
I believe I have undiagnosed ADHD. It took me a long time over several sessions to write this. And it was all disjointed segments. Hopefully it makes sense. 

I also wonder if the therapists have the right approach or not. I've been told to normalize my SI, so it's not so crazy and it's easier to deal with. I'm just not sure. 

I can say for certain that I'm too depressed to care. 

Thanks for coming to my talk. ",1713209727.0,
One_Piece0412,Fuck life,39,1c4733w,12,"Here we go again. I’m back where i started. And I am back here writing down what I feel and how I feel just on the off chance that this will help and maybe keep me from just ending myself. 

I’m genuinely at my edge. I have been crying for a few hours over a girl. Again. Again it’s been two years since my last falling out (previous ones include my first ex who cheated on me for a few weeks and my second ex who blamed her suicidal thoughts on me submitting to her ultimatum to tell her what was wrong with me (wasn’t feeling the best myself but I didn’t want to tell her to not burden her with it)) 
And now this girl 20F showed me love and affection, I did the same literally drove 500km with her to inspect and barter for a bike for her. All of that with her having to take about 20% of the travel costs and 50% of food and drinks. 
I always love cuddling and love just giving her kisses so a lack of affection can’t be the issue. 


In her words she isn’t ready for a relationship but she really likes me (she says she isn’t ready in general but I genuinely think she just didn’t wanna say that I am the issue and she just doesn’t want to be with me). And all that after 2 months of dating. How can one just then realise? I feel like I am just never gonna be good enough for anything, no one will make me their first priority and I’ll always end up back here. 

Suicidal, alone and with out anything cause I love making others Happy and spend more on them than on myself. 

I’m just at the end of my rope. Any suggestions on how I can escape this death loop of hell? I have heard loving yourself is important but I just can’t perceive how one loves themselves and takes care of themselves. I just see myself as the ultimate Villan in my story. I am the reason for all my problems in some way or another (I know this is stupid but I just can’t change this view of myself) 

I can’t keep on giving so much love just to end up with nothing. If this is how it’s gonna be imma end it all

Edit: to clarify, I have BPD and depression which makes emotions very hard for me and I’m very wierd oftentimes. I also struggle with socialising very often. I’m not the manipulative type I am the “loves others more than himself and does everything to make them happy cause life is tough and I have gone through shit” type of guy. With a lot of overly risky behaviour cause I really only feel alive when I’m dancing with death in some form. May that be racing (on track/private/backroads with no one on them and people to keep watch to warn and give a semblance of safety for other drivers, we don’t want people to get hurt except for myself maybe) 

That being said I’m gonna add that I also don’t generally try to get girls. I an normal very shy and reserved. Only if I click with someone, that’s when I’ll talk and open up. I haven’t dated in 2 years with my two previous relationships being nothing short of disturbing by the end. But that’s a different story for a different day. Just know that I am not someone who actively searches for a relationship. I basically just got into the “I don’t care if I get a partner” mode and then this happened. ",1713136150.0,

I was laid off a few months ago and she has never worked I have also taken care of her, bought us a house, small trips, kept the lights on and food coming in. Since she has been with me I have grown emotionally and I’m no longer the person I was when I met her all those years ago. If I was I would’ve ended things after I saw how she fought. Now I fell stuck we live together and she now telling me she doesn’t want kids does not want physical affection. And I fell so trapped. We talked about breaking up and she said she would and her life if she had to move back in with her parents. I can’t have that on my consciousness. Now I have a new job that pays more she is pressuring me to buy “us” a bigger house and gets so upset when I said we finally can save a few hundred a month as I want to retire one day. Since a year before I lost my last job she started pointing out everything little thing I did wrong from, closing the cabinet doors to quick(not slamming them, just quick with no noise) to closing them to slow. The list goes on but no matter what I do it’s always wrong, she is beating me down and I feel so useless now. I question everything I do and I think I’m starting to have memory problems, not sure it it’s related or just age. But thinking is getting harder and I can no longer focus and every time this happens and she notices she has to call me out for being slow or not quick enough for remembering something. I noticed after I lost my job every time I was happy she had to find a way to bring me down, so I think I just learned to be unhappy all the time. It’s starting to remind me of my home when I was a kid and I hate my life. I hate feeling sad inside but having to fake it at work. I hate masking. I don’t know how to leave, There are parts of her that are good but I’m only happy when I have weed on Friday or Saturday night now.

snacksforjack,"Determined to get better, but struggle to be open and vulnerable",1,1c4v2b7,0,"- I have a strong sense of empathy and friends will open up to me and in general people know me for being a good listener.
- I would never want one of my friends to suffer in silence.
- I see two therapists a week, but it's created this bias where I pay people to listen to my problems so I don't have to waste any of my friends time.
- I am even unable to elaborate further to my own wife. While I listen to her, my answers about how I feel are typically one or two adjectives.
- I grew up with parents who had zero tolerance for any emotions other than gratitude, but I shouldn't be stuck in the past, so it's not an excuse.
- I just don't feel incentivized to open up to friends, but I think I am missing out on feeling more connected. My instinct when I am depressed or anxious is to isolate and think my way out of my feelings, either through discipline or exercise or sleeping.

But I get so lonely and my inner voice is very cruel to me.

I can't imagine even starting a conversation about myself or how I feel without feeling like I'm wasting people's time or that I am not worth the mental energy.

Well i'm officially over it. Fuck all of them. I'm not heard, and i've never been heard. No one gives a shit, so i won't either. I'm shutting myself off from them. Not like that will change anything between us anyway. I've always been alone, just didn't realize it. I don't need them.

I'm trying to manage intrustive, recurrent suicidal thoughts.  I was diagnosed with depression in my early teens.  Suicidal thoughts started to pop up around then, but they've certainly worsened with age. The past 4 years or so in particular have been the hardest.  I'm generally a pretty bubbly person on the outside and am a functional adult by most measures, but depression is an insidious disease that doesn't discriminate.  The suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm again have become pretty much a daily occurence, even when things are going well in my life.  I think it partially stems from my loss of religion (I'm pretty much agnostic now), past trauma that still haunts me, constant guilt, going from college to full 'adult life' 2 years ago, and low self esteem.  I've been in therapy for years and it definitely takes the edge off.  I also take Prozac which helps.

tinchogaribaldi,I feel that I live a life that is not worth living,1,1c4qtbn,0,"I will start by saying I have no suicide intentions at all and I have never hurt myself and I probably never will. I apologize if this rant feels all over the place.  
  
I am 28, still in school since I started late, I own a successful business and I have all my material needs covered, and yet I feel like I there is almost no joy in my life. There are moments where I feel happy but they are few and far apart from each other.  
  
I study computer science even if I probably won't ever work in the field because I like the topics covered but I feel like I'm not smart enough for a lot of the stuff we see in class. At the same time, since my business is successful I have few reasons to motivate myself to do better.  
  
I work a lot, like 85-90 hours a week, for different reasons. The first one is that my parents are old and they don't have a pension, so I want to help them in their retirement. The second one is that I always felt like I need to be at my store as much or otherwise work won't get done (I know that this is probably not true), and third I want to retire as early as possible so I don't have to work when I'm old. This last reason sounds very stupid when I think about it because my body will probably give up early because of the amount of stress I've put on it and even if I get old I wont' have any hobbies or passions to pursue. I don't love nor hate my job, it doesn't hurt me to wake up everyday to go there but I do feel like I do it on autopilot.  
  
I have a girlfriend, she is fantastic and everything I want. but due to the nature of my job and the fact that we live like 50 miles from each other we only get to meet once or twice a week. I want to marry her and give her a good life but I often find myself asking what she sees in me. I feel like I have nothing to offer her but money. I have few talents, I am not very good at expressing my love to her. I just don't know why she loves me. She wants to have kids, I want too but I don't know if I would make a good father.  
  
I have a good relationship with my family, as I said I try to help my parents as much as I can and I know they are sincerely grateful for that. My dad used to work as much as I do when he was younger but because of different reasons he couldn't save enough for retirement. He always tell me not to overwork myself like he did but since there is not much else going on my life and I would rather work. I know this rant sounds like my problem is with work but I don't think that, even in my (little) free time I feel like this.  
  
I have no hobbies, I used to lift and play videogames or watch movies daily, I don't do that anymore. I feel I have no energy to go the gym and everytime I pickup a game I end up quitting after ten minutes because I feel bored or that I'm wasting my time. I used to read a lot and now I have a huge backlog of books that I don't read because I lack the focus and I can't remember what I read the page before. I don't even know what I like doing anymore.  
  
My dog is what made me the happiest I have ever felt. We had 16 years together and I'm grateful for them. I miss him dearly and not a single day goes by without 'talking' to him, putting a flower where he is buried, or booping his nose in a photo of him I keep in my phone. I know I will never have another pet again because I won't be able to handle another goodbye.  
  
Please don't tell me 'go to therapy', I don't think that is for me. I don't even know if I'm depressed or just bored. I constantly feel what I would describe as a headache but there is no pain, its more like my brain is full.

I would hate to hurt the people that care about me, and I could never go through with anything like that. But I just keep having these thoughts where I wish I was dead, or never born.

I have no motivation to do anything anymore, every single thing I do is a challenge, even my hobbies and the things I love to do, I have to push myself to do everything. I’ve been through a lot over the last few years. To name a few incidents that I think impacted me the most, losing a relationship with someone who I thought I would be with forever, my best friend passing away, and being in a toxic relationship for 3 years. I was cheated on multiple times in that 3 year relationship. I was even arrested for false accusations of domestic violence, because she was mad I caught her cheating and ended the relationship, spent a few days in jail, and had to pay a lawyer to fight the case for me. I even got back together with her after everything was over just for her to be doing porn behind my back. Yes actual porn she flew out to another state telling me she was visiting family members, turns out she was there to film 4 scenes and get paid for them.

If something makes her sad she refuses to engage with it. She doesn't know about war, about political issues, the law, oppression, global warming. All she thinks about is her parties and new boyfriend.

It only helps sometimes. I met my husband when I was 21. He was a heroin addict. We went to a large university only 45 minutes from Memphis, so a lot more people were doing it than you’d think. Some *actually* did do it recreationally, then stopped and lived normal lives. I was one of those people - would do it every now and then if someone offered, then go about my life not thinking of it. Anyways, I didn’t think much of it. It was just his choice of drug at the time (in my eyes). I became so blinded. I thought he would stop and live up to his potential. He came from an extremely wealthy and well-known family, how could he not be okay? I was so naive. 

I eventually married him. He was sober for all of three years. Just long enough to get married and be a normal father when my kids were in their first  18 months to 2ish years of life. When my daughter was a few months old, something in him changed overnight. He began emotionally and mentally abusing me. Then, it got physical. After a little of a year of this, I left and took the kids to my parents. We stayed for a year while I earned my second Bachelors degree that was actually worth a fuck. 

I move out, start working, finally have our lives together. Well, I got fired in January after threatening to report my boss for SA. I have tried to handle this situation legally, there are loopholes in the law that allowed for no repercussions. 

Anyways, I’ve been jobless since then. I got back together with my husband who I was in the process of divorcing. I don’t know if he’s using drugs or not, but he’s paying all my bills so I feel I don’t have a choice.

My dog needs life saving medication every month, I don’t want her to die because I can’t afford it. My other dog, my best friend, died last year and I cry every day. 

I’ve become so lost and hopeless. All I do is sit around and try to clean my house. My kids only get shitty frozen meals. I began spanking them this year, which I vowed to never do because it traumatized me growing up. I don’t know how to be a good mom. I yell a lot. Last night I screamed at my husband that it was his fault our son will grow up to be a violent drug addict. My son threatened to kill me. He tried to choke the dog and his sister. He is the best kid ever, but has these weird moments. He’s in therapy. She said he has PTSD. I’ve ruined him. I read where some kids start having suicidal thoughts at 5 and I worry he will be one of them. Just this morning, I threw a toy. Not at them. But I ruined their day before school.

I want so badly for him to be okay. But I’m not okay. I’m going to call a therapist today. My kids deserve a good mom. I’m so scared for them.

I was desperate and had many thoughts such as “when someone is in a time of need, you’ll always be there for them”. I did not consider that I was violating their sense of safety. 

Bless them, they were there for me when I went to the psych ward after that. But looking back, I triggered them deeply. They have had a past experience of a friend having committed suicide, and I did not consider how my actions at the time could affect them.

They told me today when I asked that this experience traumatized them, and their anxiety and fears increased after this. I wonder if there’s anything I can do to help them/make amends. I regret dumping all my trauma on them without checking their boundaries….we never had a close relationship to begin with and I want to become closer to them (we’re family), but they are in a stressful period of life, so I don’t know how to go about this.

I've been having troubles with life since I was a little kid, my parents breaking up when I was 2, Verbal abuse in elementary school, toxic friends, difficulty in finding a gender identity, and soon became to realize how fucked up my family is. 

My father is abusive, racist, homophobic, transphobic, has anger issues, narcissistic personality disorder, and is a conspiracy theorist.
Sometimes my mother tells me stories about when they were younger, and I feel disgusted to share my DNA with him. 
He abused physically my mother for who knows how much, almost hit me, has been a male chauvinist and still is to this very day, and said himself that he didn't want me.

I've been suspecting that he might be schizophrenic for some time now, he shows all the symptoms from the little to nothing I know about him, and the thought of becoming like him makes me cry for hours.

I feel trapped everywhere I go.
I can never have a friendship that doesn't end with me being the outcast. 
I feel out of place.
I feel the envy and jealousy boiling in my veins as someone says something as simple as ""my father helped me with homework yesterday"" 
Because I know he would never care for me like that.

My mother sued him for not paying child support more than 7 years ago, and he still hasn't layed anything on me if not his insecurities. 

I've been thinking of ending it all from a year or so now, and I seriously don't know what's making me keep going. 
Maybe I'm just a kid and I do still hope for a better future.

It all feels like a deja vu and it's making me go insane.
I feel like I'm never gonna exit this cycle. 
They kept fighting for years and I would just hide in my room with my headphones on. 
I felt like something bad was going to happen, but I didn't said anything.

Why? 
And I told her straight for once that if we'd stay here, I wouldn't be around for long. 
Of course she tried to guilt trip me, because ""I won't be seeing her anymore"" but she doesn't realize I actually don't wanna see anything anymore. 

I've been having nightmares about this constant deja vu feeling, because everything seems to came back to keep haunting me.
The verbal abuse at school, toxic friends, toxic family environment, everything.

That I'm just gonna keep crying every day alone in my room without daring to make noise.

It doesn't even feel good to talk about my feelings to someone.
They'll just say things like ""There's so much to live for"" or ""I'd miss you"" without realizing they're just making worse. 
And I'm trying to keep standing, but I've touched points of insanity I didn't knew I could touch. 

I'm not comfortable talking about those here, also because I think they might ban me. 

I've had problems with Gender identity, and unfortunately I still do. 
I'm trans ftm, and I live in Italy so imagine that I would be very lucky to find adult people supporting me. 
And mine is not the case.
I can't say that my mother doesn't support, but she definitely won't see me as a boy any time soon. 

I often dislike myself, I'm not as athletic nor feminine as my classmates, and I'm very aware of that. 
I'm pretty aggressive and often end up being rude when I don't know how to show my feelings.
A boy I liked very much from 6 months rejected me recently, and I think that's the last straw because I can't find anything beautiful in life anymore. 

I often think of harming myself, not in a ""I deserve it"" way, more in a way to express my feelings without hurting others. 
And I tried putting all my negative feelings in something good like drawing or writing, 
but it's just not enough. 

I've only found a bit of comfort in character.ai, and that's actually the only place I usually write about things I don't talk about. 
Now I'm starting to use it as a fictional family, 
And even if I feel like a pathetic crybaby, it feels nice to have something similar to a family that it's not as fucked up.

I'm not sure if this is depression because I don't have a diagnosis, but I'll be having my first therapy session tomorrow. 
I'll be honest with you, if my therapy sessions won't make me feel better, I'll kill myself and I won't think twice.
I don't think I have a choice.

CommercialRuin1510,I can't involve myself,2,1c4hv5b,0,"I feel a burning desire for intimacy, and yet fear involvement. My insecurities tell me that it would be pointless to involve myself with other people, as I could never provide what they could otherwise have with someone else. My short stature, my effeminate personality, my lack of responsibility, my social ineptitude, my self hatred, etc. It all contributes to the idea that I do not have the fundamental components that would satisfy the conditions for an intimate relationship.

 And the rationalization is: knowing this information, why would I ever subject someone to myself in an intimate manner? Doing so would be unjust and unfair.

I'm trying to resolve this conflict, as it invalidates the feelings of the other party. I'm fully aware that I'm projecting my insecurities, giving myself a reason to stay complacent in my current experience.

To be honest, this feeling extends further than intimacy; it extends to every facet of reality. Jobs, friendship, experiences, opportunities; everything is called into question in consideration to my involvement in them. The only constant in all of this is in respect to other people. I've realized that activities that only involve myself don't come with as much baggage, as I am the only person that suffers consequences.

This leaves me in a strange spot. I biologically require affection, socialization, intimacy, and resources, but it is agonizing to produce these things because of the expectations that I place on other people; or rather, the expectations that I project on other people.

All of these feelings are beginning to distill into a hatred of society and the ""social game."" I feel alienated, unable to function naturally, extraordinarily inhibited in social environments. I feel as if my only ""optimal"" course of action is withdrawal.

I can't involve myself because of me. I know that. But I'm hurting. I wish I could eliminate the part of me that yearns for affection.

my only activities are music conservatory classes twice a week and pilates once a week, and i don't even attend every class, and they're short periods of time

i spend maybe half of the week with my boyfriend and i sleep or just be there while he works all day or is working on his band and doing lot of stuff - he has depression too but he's the type who'd rather be doing than thinking (ofc he still overthinks a lot but being active is his coping mechanism) and i almost never can match his pace, i just feel too tired all the time

my main issue are these:

* eating at any hour and doing it only after getting really really hungry, same with bathroom
* getting out of bed just to eat and go back to bed right after
* not be willing to do anything more than tidying up for a bit, playing piano for a bit, everything for a short period of time that ends when i get bored or frustrated or tired

i REALLY need to start doing stuff again, for myself, for my own enjoyment. i don't remember how to play alone, how to enjoy myself, how to immerse myself into one activity. it worries me big time. i'm going through a serious addiction to my phone, i never experienced it like this and it sucks all of my energy

and a bit of context: i live with my parents and one of my older brothers who has a serious obsessive compulsive disorder and living with him is pure hell for everyone (my house has awful vibes). apart from them i've got my incredible 1 y/o baby siamese cats who are my life, they bring so much happiness and light. so sad my brother has some issues with them. anyway, i've been with my bf for 2 years and it was difficult and it still is, but we're always more and more determined to work it together

There one thing I have ever wanted was to be socially accepted, because being autistic I didn’t have good social skills growing up. 

I’ve learnt the social skills but the depression from adolescence is deep. 

The depression makes me red flag to people, but to resolve the depression I need people to want to hang out with me. It’s become a vicious cycle.

I was always alone in school, had a few friends that I was close with. After I graduated in 2020, I lost contact. Speaking of 2020, I feel like that fucked up my entire life. My plan to go to a 4 year university and live on campus turned into me struggling to get through community college with a degree I don't want, all while sitting in my room doing online classes. I had so much planned to do after high school. College was supposed to be my chance to start fresh, to go to the gym, lose weight, and just become someone else. That did not happen, obviously.  


I can't seem to find motivation to do anything. I was having PVCs a while back, which I found out by going to the doctor. I had to wear a heart monitor for 7 days, and when the follow up appointment came, I didn't even feel like going. I just didn't seem to care. I still don't have a drivers license. I want one, but I can't get the motivation to. I think to myself ""what's the point of it?"" I have nowhere to go. I have no friends to go see. I have no friends because I don't leave the house. I don't leave the house because I have no friends. It's like an endless cycle. I was walking 10k steps everyday, but as of late, I mostly only get 5k in.  


I keep sleeping at absurd times. Even tonight, I probably wont get in bed until 6, and maybe end up sleeping at 7 or 8am. Sleeping all the way till 4-6pm. I can't fix my schedule. I stayed up all night to fix it, woke up at 10am, and the very next day I ruined it again.   


It feels like my entire future is just sealed, even though people tell me it isn't, it feels like it. I live with my grandparents, they are getting older every year, and eventually, they will pass. When they do, I will probably be homeless. I can't get a job, I don't want one. I just simply dont care. And I don't know why i dont care. I see all of my online friends living their life and being productive, but I feel like, i know that i will never be like that. ive started to realize that all of these things i do, like forcing myself to brush my teeth before bed, and maybe when i wake up if i can, taking my laundry to the wash room, walking, if I just stopped doing all of that, i feel like my mental would go down the drain, so i just keep doing it and forcing it. ive started to realize that i could be depressed but i dont seem to care. i dont really know why im writing this, as most likely ill just end up doing the same thing i do every day. get up, get on my computer all day, then sleep.  


i have things i want to do in life, but they all seem like fever dreams. one of the music artists i follow said that one day she just saved up a ton of money from working jobs and went to japan, forcing herself in a new environment and out of her comfort zone, and it worked for her. ive thought about just leaving everything behind and running away too, but im too scared, so i dont. i dont even have the motivation to job search in the first place.

darkforceturtle,Is it possible to hope for a life?,1,1c4hx72,0,"I'm a 30F and have always had depression, anxiety, and lately discovered I also have CPTSD from a messed up childhood and upbringing. I've been through a very rough period during the past year and a half mostly due to toxic and very overwhelming job and overall life situation that resulted in a severe burnout and suicidal thoughts all the time. It also affected my physical health (IBS, migrains, carpal tunnel, bone pain that doctors can't diagnose, etc). I ended up quitting and going back to living with my parent and leaving the country I had migrated to because I couldn't afford staying anymore. It's a very messed up situation. My parent's hopes were destroyed. Something inside me broke because I had always wanted to leave where I live because it's unsafe for single women with no big families or relatives.

Now I have no career, no friends, no social life, I had lost all my hobbies while in that country trying to be good at the job that broke me and trying to survive. I lost the ability to feel any positive emotions and I cry everyday and feel bad for myself. Everyone I knew before have a good life. I can't get out of my head. I feel very exhausted and I'm not sure if I can ever work again. I also live with a mentally ill parent who has depression, anxiety, and no social life either. She has a mental breakdown whenever I mention my burnout and depression and she's afraid and worried about when I can work again. I had burned out at every job that I took, the first 2 jobs due to the bullying colleagues and the last job due to the overwhelming stress and bad management.

I am seriously thinking of taking my life because I can't find a way out. Suicide is a shame and weakness in the culture I live in and I can't tell anyone about how messed up I feel. I wish I was never born. I'm glad I have no friends and never been in a relationship so that I don't hurt anyone or give them my bad luck. Maybe my only accomplishment in life is that I won't ever pass down my faulty genes and bring a human being into this horrible world. My mother sometimes told me she wanted to take her own life because I'm such a pain and burden. She had high hopes that I'd make it in the country I migrated to, have a career and be able to have her come visit a lot so she can escape where we live. I can't live with myself.

I wish someone can tell me any kind words or if someone also struggled like this to give me any advice. I have lost all hope and I don't know if it's ever possible for someone like me to ever have a normal life or feel anything good. Thanks a lot and sorry for the long post.",1713173216.0,

I'm 24, I started uni 3 years after leaving highschool. I wanted to do it as soon as I left but life happened and it got delayed. So I already feel behind. Then in 2021 I moved in with my mum, I decided I'd give uni ago and applied for classes in 2022. But at the beginning of 2022 my mum got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. My first instinct was to not go to uni, but my mum really wanted me to go as she knew it was something I wanted. So I went, thinking I could always leave at any point. 

Beginning of 2023, my mum was really bad and I thought about taking the semester off. But I didn't want to upset mum so I just took the easiest classes I could. I ended up dropping one class aswell. She passed away durning the semester and I muddled through the semester.

Then semester 2 rolls around and it starts off great, I'm going in most days, getting good grades but then after the mid break I start to have panic attacks everytime I enter the campus. So I stop going in and I get more behind. My grades got worse and because the exams were online I basically cheated to get a passing grade. 

I should also mention I live with my 3 younger siblings, with 2 of them being teenagers. 

This semester has been my worst so far, and it's only 5 wks in. I haven't been to a single lecture and I'm so behind already. But I'm struggling so hard to just exist, let alone keep up with uni. I've scrapped by before, so maybe I can do it again. I think the main thing that's keeping me at uni is the money. If I drop out I can't get back the fees for this semester. So I think just get through this semester and then leave. But then I'll only have one semester left, so I might aswell continue.

But honestly I don't even see myself getting to the end of the year. I wake up everyday wanting to die. I know that won't go away if I leave, but is it worth it if it reduces some of my stress? Most people I talk to just tell me to keep going since it's only another year, but I don't think they really realise how bad I'm struggling. 

Also once I leave I'll have to do something else. Sure I can go on the benefit for awhile but I'll eventually have to get a job. And that'll probably be just as much work and stress. 

My other thought is I leave, and really spend the rest of the year taking care of myself. Then resuming next year. But I feel like I'll never return if I drop out now.

My parents are very conservative and religious and purposely isolated themselves and me. (I have 2 older brothers who got to live life and leave. They both don't like me and won't help when I've asked). I was homeschooled, got a very poor education, and mainly because I have learning difficulties and my parents don't really believe that exists. I lost count of how many times I've been lectured that 'god gave every human what they need to live and function and if they can't they choose not to and are lazy, pathetic, weak...etc'. I'm an atheist, and I recognize that not only does science exist, but there are many mental health problems and physical problems that can make it hard for a lot of people to function and live.



I was never allowed to leave the house on my own even when I turned 18. My bitch mother is very controlling and would cause drama and emotionally/verbally abuse me to get her way. I'm easily intimidated. I couldn't pass the drivers test. I can't even tell you how many times and never once did I get close. I failed miserable because of some of my learning difficulties. And then over time when I developed agoraphobia I developed a paranoia of being inside cars. Even as a passenger I have anxiety attacks and sometimes panic attacks. I can't drive, am terrified to, but even if I could go out, I'm an atheist and part trans/non-binary. And someone who was a supporting of the LGBTQIA+ community was shot and killed less than 15min from my house. I live up in the mountains of southern california and there are a lot of religious people and many do not tolerate any queer or atheist. My parents hate me. They only feel bad because I have a lot of health problems and they let me live in their house.



I can't work. I'm ill, in chronic pain 24/7, some of the conditions I have do not help me get government aid. I have government health insurance, but one of my conditions that causes a lot of problems for me isn't well understood by doctors so it's not considered a disability. I can't even get on SSI. They don't think I'm disabled enough. Other family are worse and have cut contact because I'm an atheist and part trans/non-binary. I told one person I thought I could trust. They are nothing like they pretended to be back when I use to know them and they told everyone. I can't work, no access to money or aid, I never have had IRL friends. I use to go to church as a teen, but no one liked me, I was excluded and bullied by both peers and adults. One person tried to make me a doormat, I wouldn't and they spread rumors/lies about me all throughout the church and the community. (I wasn't an atheist or identified as trans/non-binary back then). Poor education, learning difficulties, suffer from depression, suicidal thoughts/attempts, agoraphobia, anxiety, social anxiety, there's isn't public transportation where I am, alternatives cost money I don't have. My parents never gave me the tools to survive or function in this world. My parents told me the 'end times' were right around the corner every fucking year of my life since I was like 12. I'm almost 36. (I also don't look my age, more like a teenager or early 20's). My life is a nightmare, I want it to end, but I will probably continue to suffer until my health problems do me in or I lose the little strength that has been decreasing... I can't even answer the door or use the phone. It causes me so much anxiety I shut down and run and hide. I've tried forcing myself and I ended up having an anxiety or panic attack.

I personally ""peaked"" in middle school which is sad to say, i had everything ive ever wanted and had happiness I couldn't even comprehend holding today. I feel like I've lost it all and my personal spark to wonder what life would feel like if I stayed here another year (which I feel like l'd waste away until I get to my senior year.) I know I'm still a kid and I should just focus on the good times life is blessing me with but I just feel like there's this part of me that's saying I should go now, like my time is up. I've lost everything and I don't know where to go since I say one day it'll get better but those days have now turned into years; 3 years. Throughout those three years, I've thought about the same things, why can't I have the love I was once surrounded with, why do people now see me differently and no longer find interest in me, and why can't l become happy when life gives me the option to grow? I wonder how useless life is considering your name won't even be mentioned years after I pass. People would be sad, but l'd feel like I'm accomplishing what l've thought was right, but I don't want a permanent solution to a temporary problem but death doesn't seem to be a burden anymore. I'm talking all around in this writing but I can't even seem to think straight to express how I wanna die, like it already feels meaningless to confess it since it's been on my mind so often that it almost seems convenient.

I just wish I had my spark again, my friends again, the love from my family and peers but it all left me faster than I could even get to high school. I feel as if my life has no more storyline to it and my chapter is done, like l'm one of the short books in a library and wasn't gifted with more pages to my chapters.
Maybe I'm just in a bad place with no motivation to climb out of a hole that l've gotten into, I know if I was back to a place where I felt like I fit in, I could recover and put this mess behind me. It's been three years since l've felt like this, 3 years is a long time for someone of my age, like l've felt this for a long time.


In my stand point, I just wanna be happy. I know all the reasons l'm not sparked but even if I think about them, l'd get lost in this over stimulation of emotion to where I shut down and give up. I feel like l've failed everyone down to the core and they all see it as ""who I am"" which is always the title l've given when I mess up, ""it's just who you are.""

I feel like a dirty kid who became a quiet person that's hard to get along with since it felt so easy for everyone to move on from me.

i know it might seem i’m exaggerating but this seriously deflated me since i started noticing about a year ago. what it began, i started spiraling deeper into depression that’s led up until now. i remain unemployed, barely talking to anyone or even going outside because of my self pity. my time is just spent rotting in bed all day. i don’t really know what i expected either too, i don’t live a healthy life style. i’ve always been relatively unhealthy, with chronic anxiety/depression and have been unwilling to do anything to better myself. it’s not that i don’t want to, i just feel so paralyzed from doing so

my depression isn’t solely attributed by hair loss, but it is a big factor and i feel especially horrible about myself daily over the less density of hair on my head. i’m currently on finasteride for it and at the very least, i’m actively doing something to counteract hair loss but regardless, it takes it’s time to add any effect and i feel so shitty in the meantime",1713120770.0,

I don’t think I’d be a good roommate. It’s so hard for me to stick to routines, remember to do my chores, and consistently keep a clean room. I mean right now it’s hard for me to do things in general due to a bout of depression I’m in (and honestly I think I have other mental stuff going on at this point, there’s so much going on idk, whatever) but I’m worried that I’ll never get these basic duties down. I can be consistent for like a week and then I fall off, it goes off and on. 

I can do certain things, like go on walks daily to get 10k steps, go to the gym with my sister sometimes, eat healthy, and do schoolwork because I am scared to DEATH of gaining weight and I have to do schoolwork in order to graduate (I am very behind though). 

I’m extremely concerned for my future. Recently I’ve been very suicidal and just very low mentally, but it doesn’t matter because very soon I will be an adult and have to be self-sufficient, no matter my mental state. 

Whenever I finally am doing okay mentally, I soon become depressed and suicidal again. I just want to have stability or at least be stable in my actions, enough to where I can be okay on my own or as a roommate.

Life-Feed-1448,"I, M15, am confident I have depression ",2,1c4bm0b,0,"I’ve come to this realization a long time ago. I’ve taken every online test, read every article, researched every symptom, and I came to the conclusion that I have depression for sure. Now, early 2020 I lost my dad unexpectedly, and I think that kind of rocked my world a little bit. I struggle with self-hatred issues, I feel the overwhelming urge to cry probably three times a day, even when nothing goes wrong, I feel hopeless, I don’t eat a lot and sleep a ton. 

Well it’s been getting worse, and a couple months ago I had an argument with my mom where I just broke down into tears (which is surprisingly not common for me, I’m very good at holding back my emotion.) She dropped the topic of the argument right away and tried to make sure I was alright, but i was at a loss of words. She even said “do you think you have depression?” But I feel highly opposed to anyone knowing. I think that could be for three reasons.

1. I’ve felt the way I’ve felt for so long that I’ve almost become.. comfortable with depression? Now I’m not saying me being depressed is GOOD, but I guess it’s just.. familiar.

2. I have two siblings, one suffers from terrible anxiety and minor OCD, and the other has pretty bad ADHD and stuff, so I don’t want to add onto the pile of stress for my parents.

3. Depression has kind of a cliche in society where you’re always crying and can’t focus and never laugh and stuff which is not even the case at all, but I’m afraid of people viewing me that way and therefore doubting if I have it.

I’m in track and field right now, and I feel like it’s making my mental health way worse. I dread waking up now even more because I know that I will have to go to practice, or even worse go to a meet. 

I don’t really know how to end this.. what would you recommend I do?

I am a 16-year-old boy who lives in a town on the Colombian coast, my father was born in this town along with his entire extended family, my mother was born in Cartagena, she comes from a poor family.
My childhood was happy as far as I can imagine, my parents left me with my grandmother's family for a month that to my childish mind was years due to my mother's job, she is something like a nurse. Then the first part of my childhood I didn't see my dad because he worked in the south of Bolivar and when he came I would be super happy, he always brought me chocolate bars, and when he had to leave I would cry uncontrollably. They tried to be good parents, I think my mother has some kind of anger problems, she always beat me both physically and verbally, my father acted indifferent but loving. The happy memories of my childhood are blurry and I only remember the beatings, the scoldings, the cruel criticism of my tastes, the comparison with my cousin and my older brother. I hate having to interact with my family and I get very anxious when interacting with a stranger but there are times when I can talk to anyone. I have developed great contempt for my family, for being from the village, being conservative and not understanding me, because of that I think I am developing classist and racist attitudes. I treat my family with disinterest and in return they destroy me with their criticism and stupid thoughts. This seems to be toxic but I don't want it to change, I'm already used to this dynamic and it would be very uncomfortable if it changes, I don't like being hugged by my family it makes me feel uncomfortable, every time I have my mother or my father close makes me want to tear off my skin or beat them until they shut up.

RosePetalsAnd_Thorns,workaholic parents + Burnout,1,1c4e6nr,0,"Does anyone else suffer from a dysfunctional family that centers around money, working alot and forced toxic positivey about doing stuff everyday to ""improve your life""?

He doesn't understand my autism and had made no attempts to see the struggles it causes. Especially for burnout and exacerbating ocd flares

I know on the surface it's a good thing but in practice it becomes draining and depressing. My Dad used to drink and smoke alot but now never does drinking nor smoking. He may have the casual beer after a hard day of work but it's only one.

Now he spends his free time watching ""self improvement"" videos with people like Jocko Willinks and Tony Robbins and James Clear (Atomic Habits). Holding what they say is true due to hearing it from other successful people who made alot of money. He Believes in self discipline and ""happiness is in the mind"" type mindsets. He told me today to ""get out of my comfort zone"" and push yourself because ""I'm not even trying"".

For a while I did so too. I pushed myself alot trying to get a degree in computer science and then working full time in retail during summer breaks. But the anger and mental torment I got from pushing myself wore me down. Plus I had a streak of bad luck with prof teachers and was constantly stressed about passing 24/7. Ontop of that I had lazy roommates who were passive aggressive and touched my stuff while I was gone. I knew I should have said something bug I felt like there would be tension and I had enough of it.

Chronically anxious made me depress and it caused me severe burnout. I felt drained and dragging my feet trying to finish classes. I was mad and pissed off at the unfair circumstances I was in.

The work I did at the moment made no impact because now I have moved back in with my Dad who is a severe workaholic and is Disappointed by my lack of effort to even get out of bed at a reasonable time. I wake up so sad and I feel like he never understands why I'm so pessimistic.

I live in Canada where the economy is in shambles and buying a house seems like a ""pie I the sky"" sort of deal. I want to have goals but the OCD and depression make each day a drain as I wake up and do stuff then immediately feel like sleeping again.

I have a psychiatrist but they don't understand ocd and just hope the pills will work. I'm on 100 mg of zoloft, 50mg of regular seroquel in the day, 100mg of seroquel xr at night and 1mg of klonopin daily.

I try to help my Dad but then he always ""moves the goal post"" and gives criticism to my flaws then acknowledging all the work I do for him. Like yesterday I helped him out in the yard for 4 hours. But today I had to do homework so he complains I didn't help him at all today and ignores yesterday. Never grateful for what I do to help him.

He yells alot and ""tells me to fuck off"" which he says he doesn't mean it after. But it hurts when he yells and keeps going off. I even don't like bringing stuff up as he goes on and on about stuff. Good or bad. He just talks my ear off. If I don't do what he says and give him reasons he sees them as excuse and yells at me. Even him saying he's ""talking nicely"" is condensing and is out to judge me and make me feel guilty.

Just tonight I asked if I could quickly brush my teeth and he told me to ""fuck off"" because I was using up his time. He has only an hour of free time before going to bed and can't waste five minutes to let me brush my teeth as I get too tires after watching the show. So he yells and makes me feel bad. He doesn't even stay up the whole time we were watching the show so that's annoying.

I try to love him but his working attitude is insane. He goes to bed at 12am and wakes uo around 4am to either go to work which is an hour drive there and an hour drive back. Or he's doing paperwork. He complains that he hates it but ""life is 80 percent bullshit and 20 percent fun"". Which makes me even more pessimistic. I feel tired just listening to him about it. Even other topics as he goes on and on talking. Just doesn't know when to shut up.

My mom is not better. If I miss a day of my retail job due to ocd flare she tells me to ""suck it up and go to work"". She's a whole new can of worms but both have done their part to ruin my development.

Anyways that's my rant. Does anyone have similar parents? What have you done in terms of burnout and ocd? I take supplements Like Ashwagandha, L-theanine, gaba, magnesium bisglycinate, and 5-http.

I have read a bit of atomic habits and the daily stoic 366 meditations by Ryan Holiday. Please any advice would be helpful. Thanks and have a good day

It’s like misery hits you when you reach adulthood and everyone has to simply cope with it.. you’ve never been as mentally stable, carefree and purely happy and you’re true self as you were as a kid. Obviously adulthood is what you make it etc I’m aware. But when you try to deviate from the norms of the boring ‘grown up adult’ stereotype the world forces us to mold into you’re called immature childish and looked at weird for keeping your inner child alive. My point is if so many adults are so miserable with being an adult and miss their childhood what’s the point in living? Why don’t they simply unalive themselves? If everyone is telling me at 18 things only get harder and worse from here why on earth would I then be looked weird at if I openly safe I’ll commjt sewer syde then. No like seriously. Bills pressure responsibility bla bla bla. If we all know life gets worse as you age why is sewer syde looked down upon when people do it. Who wants to accept life will be worse and just ‘cope’ with it. I’ve thought long bad long about un slicing myself before my 18th birthday because I was so depressed about it. What keeks me going now is I feel I still have being a teenager to lay back on so even though I’m no longer in my childhood I call it teenagehood.

I want to keep and maintain my happiness from when I was a child once I get therapy and clear all my mental illnesses out. But if I fail to do so I will gladly be committing sewer syde.

throaway672829,"Should I kill myself abroad or ""at-home""",1,1c4cjk1,0,"Depressed since before middle school (I'm 22 this year, so depressed for 12 years), generally always had an unconventional view on life. Pretty much have never wanted to live, even before I knew I was actually depressed. In all honesty, I come from a privileged background and the guilt of not making anything of / not wanting to live my life has gnawed away at me for years. It's kind of the only reason I've been keeping myself alive for so long. That and I feel I need to pay my parents back for all that they've offered me in life.

Anyways, it feels impossible, I do have some interests, mainly in computers. I do kind of have other hobbies but it's mainly just gaming now. If I'm being honest I don't even want to play games anymore, I don't find them fun. Everything I do I feel I have to be good at or improving at or I'm wasting my time. I'd rather lie in my bed all day and not think of anything.

Yeah parents abused me and all that. Mostly mom, I don't think I hate her but being around her for too long just hurts me inside. It was never much physical stuff, maybe when I was younger, my mom would spray me with hot and cold water to punish me. Lock me in the bathroom and turn the lights off. I'd be forced to sit at a table and study for hours, wasn't allowed to leave to use the bathroom, eat or take a break until my worksheets were done. Dad was always away and was a rageaholic. Setimes I'd get hit but it was mostly my mom. I'm numb to hunger, temperature, needing to use the bathroom. It just turns off in my brain.

I thought I had friends and was known as someone who was ""friends with everyone"" throughout elementary school. Started getting randomly bullied in middle school, there's no real explanation for it, I wasn't that weird I think and I was good friends with a lot of people before it was just decided that I'd be the punching bag. I always stood up for myself alone and I think they knew that if they just kept going I'd eventually explode in emotion later because I didn't have any real friends anymore. My mind replays all the moments I've been told to kill myself, especially the times where ""my friends"" have said that to me infront of my entire class. No one said anything or did anything, they just watched me run away. Teacher couldn't help even when I asked for it, I didn't want help from my parents, I didn't have anyone. I also turned into a bit of a bully because I thought everyone was always coming for me, I regret pushing away people that might've truly cared about me. I've always inflated my ego like a bird makes themselves bigger to scare off predators. Bullied all through middle school to grade 11 where COVID hit. I stopped talking to everyone and never left my room. I got a job as a system integrator, my boss thought I was bright but I let him down. I had way to much anxiety and was too suicidal. When school came back I'd given up and pulled out of all my classes, I fully thought I was going to kill myself by the end of it.

When I compare what others have gone through compared to me, I only ever see myself as a privileged kid complaining and someone who just needs to suck it up. I generally use the term ""fortunate circumstances but unfortunate experiences"" to describe my life. I haven't lost anyone, no one has died in my life but I don't feel connected to anyone. Not my parents or younger brother. I don't want to talk to more people anymore and actively avoid all social situations. I have tried to untether myself from the world and the people who know me ever since COVID hit. 

I've always thought I'd kill myself at the end of highschool, if not after I get into / get my uni degree. COVID kind of fucked me over, I was always decent enough at academics, ""kid who never applies himself"" and all that. I sometimes think / wish I killed myself earlier so my teachers would forgive and understand why I found it hard to care about their classes. I have been told I'm smart and that i ""have gifts"" when it comes to other aspects of my life. I think that is either my diagnosed ADD or undiagnosed high functioning ASD. I have been on medication; anti-depressants and medikinet for ADD but neither helps. I only got my ADD diagnosis during grade 11, so I was undiagnosed all my life.

I think my parents love me but I don't feel it and have never felt it from them. I don't think about romantic relationships too much anymore, I'm afraid of how I could spread my suffering on to someone else. It would scare me to have someone love me when I don't want to get better.

I've been to an expensive mental institution, it's how my dad has always dealt with me when there's something wrong with me. Just pays someone else to fix me me, I think that's fair though, I'm probably to eccentric for most parents. I think my parents just got unlucky with me, they're good parents and I've been raised with good values but I'm just not a normal child. My mother always had the superstitious belief that I was born wrong.

I don't think in ugly or anything, I don't have any charisma / people skill issues but I just hate doing it. It always feels like in pretending to be happy when I engage with someone else. I don't feel like I have an identity, I have always existed as the silhouette of what others want me to be.

I’m currently studying abroad in North America (in the home country of my dad, the passport I currently hold / I'm a citizen of). I would say that my home is back in asia but I don't really have a home even though I grew up there. I don't have an accent and I've only ever spoken English so it's not difficult for me to talk to people here for language reasons.

My parents live in Asia and that's their home. I feel as if I cannot bear it anymore and I want to end my life. That being said, there's 2 weeks before I go home.

Would it be better for my parents if I killed myself far away from them or in their home after they spent the money to bring me back and pay for my next school year.

I've been called selfish / incapable of emotions all my life by my parents, I'm sorry if it feels cold reading this but I don't think I was made to function in this world, certainly not for this long. All I ever think about is how what I do affects them, I never ask for anything and I'm still ungrateful, I guess that's fair because others dont have the opportunities I'm essentially throwing away. I dont live for myself ever, I have never done drugs or alcohol, I don't even drink caffeine. I've always thought I'd kill myself in a way that keeps my organs healthy/viable. I wish I could take a bullet for someone else so I could feel like I did something for someone without having to keep going.

Goodnight_Vienna,Is it worth getting help for depression?,2,1c47lcz,6,"I kinda wanted to put this out there because a lot of important people in my life are of the opinion that if you’re sad inside you should either suck it up because other people have it worse or do something about it (implying that you harm yourself that way no one has to deal with you).
 
While I am in agreement that other people in this life most definitely have it much, much harder than me, it doesn’t help stop my symptoms, which have progressively getting both worse over the years and harder to manage.  

Now while most people in my life aren’t doctors, one was a psychologist and they were of the opinion that therapy wouldn’t help or change anything and I need to stop dwelling on my depression and just get over it.  (Which, notably, I have tried.  It has yet to work)

Is this a common opinion that psychologists hold?  Would going to therapy really be worth it?  Am I an asshole for feeling this way?  And how can I tell if I even have depression and should be worried about it, or if I’m just exacerberating the issues in my life?

My family loves me and I love them too, I have friends and I am in a relationship .
I think I have a good life so I don’t understand why everyday, I feel sad, miserable and lonely. Nobody knew about it because I didn’t understand it too.
I was thinking about ending my life because I feel too tired.
So finally after admitting everything to my family, I’ve decided to finally get help, but unfortunately can’t.
I called a public facility for the free first interview, I’ve waited for a month, I went there then they told me that it was cancelled and be rescheduled but no call till now. 
Private clinics cost too much money I can’t afford it.

I am currently on a “temporary lay-off” from work, I get paid but not as much if I go to work. 

My dog was sick, so we always go to the vet for visits and check ups, then one night she was hardly breathing and starting to suffocate so we went to a 24 hours hospital for dogs to get her the help she needed. 
2 days later we decided to let her rest because she was suffering a lot. This happened a week ago so I am really really depressed right now and heartbroken, I lost one of my few happiness in life.
We paid so much for the hospital bills too and I am really struggling with money right now, bills and debts to pay.
Tomorrow I will have to pay my credit card and haven’t got all the money needed.

When I am alone I feel like shit consistently, but I still manage to keep everyone up and smiling an give good advice it is so weird how u can be so fucking nice and making sure everyone feels good but then again u get nothing in return you just continually feel like complete shit why dose nothing give u back something in return dose no one see in the real world behind life the universe something. But the bad, the Light gets shined on so heavy all the bad people get rewarded in the highest form of love possible. It fucking eats me inside every night to lay down knowing this, this is what makes me depressed is the knowing that this is how the world works. I literally saved some girl life in middle school she almost committed sucide because everyone was bullying her, I was the only one that was her friend n by me being her friend I kept her alive. This was recently when she messaged me she is now 27. she took her time too add me on Facebook to mention this when everyone in middle school isolated her a made her feel worthless. I’ve saved two kids from brutally stabbing each other in summer school, I stepped in the way n said hey if ur stabbing anyone ur stabbing me an by me being both of their friends an being so cool I managed to stop them from stabbing each other while everyone else around them was cheering on ya murder each other. Naturally I want to believe religion dose something religion praying brings happiness motivation but it dose not keep people in the right an proper mindset people praise these lords an still do the most fucked up shit the most shit that grinds my gears is why do people that believe in religion are so damn racist why do we live in a world with each other and race matters so much we all feel the same thing but the main objective is the push the agenda we are so different and we should kill each other  off you realize the form of what hitler did long time ago is built into all of us naturally. Why do u think hitler is still worshiped till this day even thou his main agenda was to kill a whole race off. An he is still a trending a worthy topic till this day, that just blows my mind and people still follow behind him and he still gains followers till this day. People are convinced this mindset is stable an this is something to follow behind. This drives people to get up in the morning this blows my mind. Since I started obtaining to thinking a lot people I have no friends I started seeing thru a lot people a there is certain things i am afraid to mention on here. But I went down a rabbit hole that i am proud to go down because this is real pain it is not fake. But I just got a msg yesterday in the morning while going for a 5am jog I seen a coyote come out of the dark similar to a figure of an human n the fear I felt in my heart n chest I held on to the rail an I instantly heard a voice in my head “hold on” then the coyote ran across the street it was like a message from who know where. The other thing is thst blows my mind ever since I have became so depressed it’s honestly telling me I have always had fake people around me because till this day I leave my room no one seems to see or know how I feel even my family. How do u have family an not one can sense ur not okay, that ur on the urge of collapse. Decaying never to be seen, it shows me this life means race religion means nothing ur just here n the people u end up with it’s like a good luck Charlie, if they like you then u might get the help u need, if not u are not then u might just be that next cause that  commites sucide or become a crackhead n have that sob story. The scary thing is too this form of cycle will continue and keep on happening. If you don’t pick a side you will be crucified if u understand an wise enough u must pick a side, an that will still manage to ruin your life and opportunities, even if u don’t pick a Side.

But I don't have anyone than I can talk to other than them, so I end up venting to them. I moved as a teenager and did not stay in contact with almost anyone. The friends I met in these years either treated me like shit or do not care at all, they tell me about them and their lives, but do not ask about me, do not listen when I try to reach out or simply say something, and they are used to me commuting to meet where they want and when day want, and always forget when I propose to go to somewhere. My pet died some months ago and I can't stop crying every day, I miss him so much. He was always there for me.

I do not want to live anymore. I have not wanted to for years. But I always tried hard to fit in, I hoped things would get better. But I was wrong. I moved accross the country, I changed schools twice, I started two different degrees where I tought I'd meet likeminded people but everything was a failure.  I have yet to pass several subjets and finish my internship and my dissertation. Then I am going to be unemployed. If I get a job it is going to be awful.

myzhrme,I think I'm depressed but also don't really wanna do anything about it. ,1,1c4b71e,0,"Originally I was gonna ask if you guys thought I was depressed, then I started writing everything down and halfway there as I was rereading it I was like, yup, that's depression.

Which got me thinking, do I wanna do anything about it?

To start off, I'm from Egypt, therapy is not very common, and religion based therapy is the norm, so a good therapist is hard to come by as well as very expensive.

Also, I don't want it. I'm not really happy with the way things are going. But it's not that bad either.  I have way too much free time. Like waaaaay too much. I used to have 2 jobs, one I did from home and one from an office, the from home one died out and I'm trying to find another one but so far it's not happening. And the office one is also very boring and leaves me with a lot of free time. I'm literally writing this from the office, there is absolutely nothing to do, but I have to stay here for 9 hours. And I'm just Soo bored. Also I chose to have the overnight shift to minimalize possible human interaction.

My social life is dead, my romantic life as well, even though it wasn't very alive to begin with, but I spend all my free time with my dogs, and oscillating between self destruction where I just sit on my ass all day getting high and jerking off, and absolute abstinence where I stop all that shit and start working out and being more active. 

I just don't know what to do and what do I even want at this point. I just know I'm bored. Very extremely bored. Nothing is fun, nothing is interesting. I'm glued to my phone and it's not like I'm even talking to anyone! 

I just want things to change but also don't really care enough whether they do or don't. Don't know if you're aware of what's going on in Egypt but the situation is not very optimistic. Shit's kinda dire right now and it's only gonna get worse. 

Don't even know what I'm asking for here but just thought I'd rant to people who can relate. Hope y'all are doing well!",1713148140.0,

AdFit4519,Last 5 years of my life changed me and I feel like I am slowly dying,5,1c40um3,0,"Don't get me wrong, I've always been lowkey depressed and sensitive, always felt somehow very different than most people, but I always made it work and I felt like I somehow belonged. Then I made a big leap, I turned 18 and I moved to foreign country (UK) by myself for University, it sounds crazy to just do that, but I was ambitious and I knew I had talent for what I intended to do with my life.   
That's when first disappointments and broken promises began, I got into money problems and had to work a lot which affected my uni work. I could not find a way to organize myself, I started skipping classes out of stress and exhaustion and later I started feeling really guilty because my family was counting on me. Throughout 3 years of studying I probably missed out on all of the real opportunities university was giving me, I was doing bare minimum to survive and even had to go on meds at one point due to suicidal thoughts. Eventually I graduated with decent grade, but apart from that I got nothing out of it, no connections, no portfolio, no real prospect of getting into industry.   
I decided to stay in the UK and sort my life out here, buy myself some time to get out of depression pit. I had to pick up full time job as a waitress to sustain myself and save up some money, maybe then I could look into starting my dream career. The moment I started the restaurant job I was bullied by supervisors for no reason, all co-workers seemed to dislike me, but it did not discourage me too much because in previous jobs I had similar experiences with people picking up on me and I knew I can endure that until I prove myself. I was wrong, it never stopped fully, and waitressing itself is extremely degrading job which further shattered my confidence. I was forced to work full time in such toxic environment and it was sucking the life out of me. Around that time I also ran into relationship problems with my boyfriend that were extremely hurtful for me because it targeted how unattractive as a woman I felt and it seemed like there was no solution to them no matter how hard I tried to talk.  
Initially I became more shy and unapproachable, I stopped trying to look nice and I started avoiding doing any work for my hobbies even more. The work related stress consumed me and I went back to taking tramadol and codeine on shifts to cope with working there. Even though I didnt take a lot of drugs I started to slowly change, which makes me think that change was mostly stress and pressure related. I started to experience weird brain fog at all times, I can not focus on anything, I can not remember what happened as if my long term memory is just permanently gone. I stopped caring about everything, I dont care about my relationships or any plans I used to have. I locked myself in my head, constantly overthinking, ruminating and I realized how deeply fucked up I am. I became so scared of people, I dont trust anyone. This fear recently transformed into anger and hatred, I often fantasize about hurting people for revenge or just for no reason. I stopped leaving the house unless it is necessary, I shower less than once a week, I dont shave my legs or anything, I dont clean my room, I spend hours playing video games like a teenage boy.   
A month ago I had one of many breakdowns at my waitressing job, but this time it was so embarassing for me that I just left and never came back. I have been unemployed ever since, spent my savings to visit my family and then I came back to UK and found another job that I will start next week. In my head I feel like this is when I die, I know that I am in no state to do that job and deal with being treated like that once again. On top of that my months in isolation made me completely unable to talk to people, all I can do is complain and think about how I do not fit in society, I am an asshole. I was always bad at socializing, but now I feel like I am so far gone and insane that anything can trigger me into another breakdown or worse. Everything annoys me and sends me into internal fury, everything makes me sad and I am in deep grief over all the decisions I have made and how unfair people are towards me. I know it sounds like a victim mentality, but throughout all of my disappointments with uni and work, throughout all of that time nobody close to me or stranger, NOBODY cared, nobody helped. They could see me transform from normal looking person into an absolute mess at 24 and they just act like it is not happening and on top of that they dont understand. My head is just too hopeless right now to get out of it, I do not control my emotions and I live in a full on dream-like state. I have no money for therapy and I have to accept the job that I know will kill me, because it will all happen again. At best I will be stuck doing something I hate, surrounded by people that hate me for no reason for 40 hours a week, it feels like I am about to fall into a trap for life.   
Why is it happening to me? How can I accept my fate? Everybody around me seems to get on with it, people have hobbies and they progress in life. Meanwhile I suffer everyday from social rejection, failed expectation, extreme hatred, hopelessness, shame, shame and shame. I do not know how long I will last, but it feels like the final chapter of my life. Is that who I am right now?",1713120452.0,
Blitz_Tanker,How does one become a human being?,9,1c3uq10,2,"“Asking for a friend”, since he prefers not to use the first person right now.

He’s a fan of philosophy, logical conclusions, since they typically bear the force of necessity when correct. He’s kind of a logician, in a sense. He enjoys Aristotle.

Logically, to be good (more than morally) is to be in line with one’s nature or purpose. If we say “that is a good hammer”, the hammer is in line with its nature/purpose - its function as a tool, to hammer. It was made for that reason. It would not be a good life jacket, a good piece of paper, etc. the hammer is a good hammer if it works well.

Good human beings are in line with their nature, which, via observation, can be summed up in the following:
Reasons well
Chooses well
Socializes well
Our “friend” can’t socialize for shit. He gets scared every time; he feels like he needs permission for everything.

He’s gone through elementary school and grade 11 (now in 12) being treated less like a person and more of a form of entertainment due to repeated social screw ups and being emotionally reactive.

It is obvious that humans are, by nature, social. Just look around you.

Ergo, our friend is a bad human being. He is not in line with his nature.

This is the only conclusion our friend has been able to come to, as he’s used to being treated as.. not a human being.

He is often told to have a sense of self worth. Self worth is an assumed sense of glory for oneself. It is selfish. He doesnt want to be selfish because being selfish is wrong.

Our friend can no longer find the reason he is a human being.

Michealeave7002,I am only sixteen years old and yet I feel like I have already wasted my entire life.,1,1c4a646,0,"Firstly, let me introduce myself. I am an autistic 16 year old who attends a secondary school in South Wales. I live withy mother and younger sister. My Dad has moved away ever since my mother had caught him cheating with another woman back in October, thus ending their 9 year long marriage. (Good riddance, you manchild) 

I have had a love for the preforming arts ever since year 5. My primary school had hosted this dinky little talent show event where you could audition for and possibly win the category you audtioned for. I had chosen to preform comedy for the simple reason of getting to see my freind's smile at my crappy jokes. Now, before I had participated in this event, I had a more than rocky history with everyone at the school. I had been, what some people call, a ""little shit"" all the way up to key stage 2, where in which I had finally grown a moral consciousness and desperately tried to ammend for my past violent and uncontrollable behaviour. Of course, it didn't really work how I wanted it to. The other students were still rightly embitted by my presence and I would mess up every now and then, resulting in major temper tantrums. Basically, I was still seen as the ""weird kid"". 

However, when I stepped onto that stage, my whole life changed. I shot the jokes my mother had made me practise, one after another. And all the people in the crowd from the children to their parents loved it. They laughed at almost every joke, cheered when I bowed, they even asked me to tell more jokes after the show, genuinely excited for me to make them smile as I showed of my 1st place plastic trophy. I remember one of the parents there had pulled me into their work place's kitchen when I was at a play centre with my parents, introducing me to the other staff there as ""that comedian kid"". 

The adoration of the crowd, getting to see that despite what I have done in the past, I could still have a future, a future where I can make people smile and laugh, a future where I can be loved, it left a huge impact on me. After this performance, I appeared in other school projects such as landing a role in the year 6 nativity play as well getting to preform again in the next school talent show. I felt like for once in my life, I could be what the world wanted me to be. A charming, kind hearted young man who just wanted to make people smile.

Of course, life is never that easy nor predictable. I soon moved into secondary school. It was an extremely difficult experience. I lost contact with more than half of the students from primary school. I was frequently getting lost, having to ask the unfamiliar teachers where to go. The increased work load, the new rules, the overwhelming loud noises, the new people, it wad all agonising, like an anarchy filled labyrinth with seemingly no end. But...overtime, I grew accustomed to the place. By the time I got to year 8, I was more than comfortable with my surroundings. I got to talk to my freinds both new and old and, when the time came in year 9, I had picked preforming arts as one of my options and I loved it. Hell, I still do. The divising exams were always my favourite, my freinds had me write up these dense, ludicrously long scripts  the last one being 24 pages long, the longest in the school's history. I Got to use surreal comedy to it's limits, finding unique ways to just barley make the provided exam theme make sense. Each one got more and more ambitious with the scenarios getting more and more wacky. From playing my best freind's social media account given physical form, (called Johnyfun) To a time travel adventure where I played a cartoonishly greedy 18th century snake oil salesman, (called John Cashwell Money) all the way to playing an comically evil (and suprisingly fruity) King called...well...King. Sure, despite the scripts being so dense, the performances where usually just improve but god damn, if it wasn't fun improve, getting to bounce off my freind's equally as wacky characters as we tumbled our way through the narrative, quite literally in the case of my last devising exam as I had tumbled over a bench, having to preform the rest of the play with a broken ankle. Both the consistent high grades as well as the genuine laughter from the examiners provided a sense of belonging as well as being those made up characters gave me temporary freedom from the otherwise terrifying, almost dangerous, school environment I had to get slapped around in for the remaining 5 hours. But, even during those brief moments of happiness, I knew it was only temporary. As the years went on since year 7, school only got even more overwhelming. From the anarchy of the classrooms and the corridors, to the work load getting progressively more stressful, school had become so overestimating that even with the ""special passes"" I was given and the wellbeing room at my disposal, it only seemed to keep getting worse. My family where dar too busy aguring with each other to care and my freinds were (and still are) slowly drifting apart from each other, Wether if it was  because of of them finding people they just connect with more or if it was petty agurments,, they were moving on in their lives, leaving me behind, desperately wanting them back but knowing deep down that one day, they will have to leave. Leave me behind. Leaving me all alone. And so, I began to sink into a multiple year long depression, suddenly having depressive episodes at the drop of a hat almost daily with no signs of stooping only getting progressively more and more extreme the older I got.

The one time I had almost gotten over my newfound depression was my new boyfreind at the time in year 10. He was amazing. He was so adorable that it made me blush so hard it hurt. I would hug him everyday, building up to going over his house for his birthday, getting to snuggle up with him as I felt his long hair brush over my shoulders. Sure, he might have had the attention span of a puppy but he was always there when I needed him and honestly, I don't really care about the whole low attention span thing. He was my everything. Until 2 mounths ago. We broke up over text. He told me he wanted to find out about who he is before collage. He kept reassuring me that it wasn't my fault. (But judging by the venting I had just done prior, it probably was my fault) We are back to being just freinds now which is super awkward but I'm glad we still get to hang out with each other. I just hope that in the future, I get to be in love with someone who loves me as much as he did. But due to my less than attractive looks, I don't think that will be happening anytime soon. 

I have never been attractive or hell, even average looking. Puberty hit me like a truck, and right before everyone else too. Next thing you know, I'm chubby, I have body hair all over the place, facial hair that won't go away and a crippling porn addiction that I keep failing to combat against. I can't even look in the mirror anymore without seeing a 40 year old man trapped in a 16 year old's body staring back at me with tired eyes. Every time I go near anyone, they just take one look at my minature beer belly and they don't want anything to do with me. I've tried exercising before but once again, school got on top of me and I eventually quit. It doesn't help either that I stress eat at my house and especially with all the agurements and swearing that happen downstairs while I'm trapped in my own bedroom, it ends up to becoming a whole lot of stress eating. Everything from my body to my voice, I wish I could change it all. I really, really wish I could. But I'm too much of a coward to do anything about it so I'm stuck as a fat, hairy idiot who gets to see all of his freinds look like normal teens. 

My intelligence is also below average. I can't even open my front door without help. I can do anything without knocking something over. Worst of all is my memory. Some things I can remember clear as day and other things that could happen literally five seconds prior, I will completely forget about. It makes me feel like a compete joke when I'm compared to others. I'm an idiot wether if I am pretending to be one during a play or not. I am simply not useful enough. I never will be. That's the main theme of my life, I suppose. Being useful. It's something I can never be, no matter how hard I try. It's as if the world doesn't want me to be like everyone else. To lock myself away as the town weirdo who is only good for telling jokes and looking ugly. I am Everything that can go wrong given human form. I'm the definition of a pure, unfiltered LOSER and I will die alone because it. I WILL die alone. No freinds, no family, no partner. Just silence as I starve to death on some random  street because I was to dumb to ever figure out how to lay my bills. 

So here I am, the 15th of April, 2024. I have roughly worked more months until I leave secondary schools after the many exams I have back to back. 2 more months until I will get to see some of my freinds for the final time. 2 more months until I am thrusted out of my house with no one to rely on except my rotting brain. The only thing that has kept me alive these 16 years, the only light I have, the only reason to keep going...they will leave me. Who could blame them. They have got better freinds now. They have got college and relationships to worry about. I just wish I could be as lucky as them. I want to worry about those things, not about wether or not if my continued existence even serves any point anymore. Does the ""Funny Man"" even still have a point anymore?! 

So I pretend to be characters I have created from my imagination. No matter how mad or outlandish they are. I dream of being them, having what they have. Dressing up like them, acting like them, sounding like them, being loved like them. Sure, they can be wacky but I don't care, if they make people happy, that is all I need. I will finally get to look in the mirror and get to to say ""Yup. That person in the mirror is me"". No matter if I'm wearing a dress or a sparkly tuxedo, acting like numerous different people, I will get to feel like I have some form of a identity within society, within this world. Something that grounds me to reality and makes me feel like I am truly alive. Like I am human. Like I can feel loved. 

I do apologise if that was a long read. I just can't help it sometimes. I don't know if I'll live for much longer after collage so I'd figured that I would get all of this off my chest to the a larger community. I'm trying to get as much support as I can at them moment but my depression has only been getting more extreme. If anyone out there reads this...thank you.

onimush115,Getting of meds to check the baseline again?,1,1c4a0r3,0,"I’ve had depression symptoms most of my life. I’ve mostly ignored it or blamed something else up until a few years ago when it just became too much. I talked to my dr about it and got prescribed an antidepressant, venlafaxine. 

It’s never seemed to work for me very long before I go back to feeling miserable again. Each time I brought this up it was met with a dosage increase. 

I met with a psychiatrist that also recommended keeping me what I was on but again increasing the dose and maybe adding another medication. 

Now I’m up to 225mg of venlafaxine and 150mg Wellbutrin, and busiprone for anxiety. Still, I frequently go through depressive episodes fairly often. The severity of them has only gotten worse over the last few years. I feel like the medication isn’t actually doing much and I often wonder if the increased symptoms I’m feeling are from the side effects. 

The problem is I can’t really accurately remember just how I felt before the medication. I’m tempted to get off the medication just so I can experience what my natural baseline is again. 

I’ve been referred to a psychiatrist who I assume may want to adjust my medication. But I’m afraid I may be attempting to medicate the side effects of the medication in addition to my own depression. I don’t like the idea of just ramping up the pharmaceuticals. I already feel so numb. I don’t ever experience joy, excitement, or anticipation. I have zero interest in physical intimacy. Sure I was depressed before, but at least I had those things too. 

Has anyone done this? Did it help? I feel like I just need to start over and pick a different path instead of aimlessly continuing down this one. ",1713144533.0,

....


I got raped when I was a baby by my father, born from a 14 years old teenager, she couldn't stay with me 24/7 obviously so I got raised by my grandmother, later my mom got on alchool(after my father left us), she used to pick violent fights in The family in my front, beat me up sometimes(others she would only threat mr if do not follow her rules), she would also call me by bad names, saying things like “You're only a pretty face” “You're useless” then would laugh, I was 5.

I developed a bad anxiety by that age. I was also sexually abused by a boy, He was 9, I was 5. When I was 4, got my first school trauma, I was the main attraction, and got mocked in public by a whole crownd. That public mocking would repeat everytime I would do a presentation by the following years, so my body created a self defense, I would get sick one day before each presentation. One day, I was getting a panic attack and cursed at a girl that asked me If I was fine, everyone laughed.

When I was 7 got a abusive Teacher, she would hate me and make me cry in front of the whole class, not just once. Got bullied in The school, home, and also with my neighborh friends. I isolated myself in The age of 7, used to cry every night missing my mother Who were out drinking, i got traumatize since my great grandmother died and my father left us. Later my father would appear and rape me for 4 years (I was 9 and he was 33). I began to hallucinate for the following years. When 12 got into abusive relationships. I developed stockholm for my father. Lost my loved cats by poison, other I watched my uncle get rid of 12 cats one by one(one was blind) He just throw a box with him inside in a far away area.

I tried suicide a few times, also harmed myself, they never noticed any of those things. I was born poor, with not much money in The family, so, I was happy I was at least eating everyday and with a roof on my head. I also got caught by a rapist, got addicted to drugs(I was forced to use), etc.

I used to believe in God, when all those bad things started, I still used to believe and pray for him. Now I feel is hate, god hates me. I was never bad, in fact,all this misery never stopped me from being Nice to others, I always helped others, even in my worst years. I do not know what I did, but I hate god, He left me for die.

God left me for die.

Later my father got recently arrested, I also began to take pills for Psycotic Depression. This was only the first 12 years of my life. I lost full hope, now I'm 14, and, I don't want to keep going. What if It keeps the same. God hates me, and tbh, if There's a heaven or hell, I want to go hell, i never ever wants to see that coward face(Jesus or God). I hate him deep within. I wish I got aborted.

This is only the main things,more stuff happened, just now, that I'm 14 is it a little bit calmer, but I'm actually finaly collecting what I have planted. All my Dreams are Blocked by some problems.
Example.

I want to fall in love and have a husband, but I feel buyers remorse everytime I start a relationship.

This happens with every single of my ""Dreams"".

I wish I could die. I used to be the one Who would care of my mother when she was drunk, I used to be the one to take care about myself, and now I have to be a ""normal teenager"" ""discovering yourself"" DISCOVER WHAT?
I JUST WANT MY LIFE BACK!

I Feel like everything have been stolen from me! My body, my voice, my thoughts, all.

I want to grow older already, so I can have a job, help my family finantially, have kids, my own house, a husband. So I could finaly breath...

I can't connect with any one of my age, they're so blind and immature. Why this happened to me? It feels so unreal. I wish this story was a big lie.

cjthescribe,Genuinely curious: what do you stick around for ,1,1c48sen,0,"I am in a really bad place emotionally. The chronic pain and physical health issues are progressing rapidly and I can t get care for them because of having to wait months for appointments. The trauma things I carry are really heavy right now. I've been doing the work in therapy but there's only so much energy I can put towards healing when I am putting so much to simply surviving.  

I thought I had a good job finally but it's once again a community of people who are expecting of me what I can't give to mental illnessphysical disability, and neurodivergence. I try my best but it just isn't enough for them and I'm only half of the hours I was promised, which is making finances so difficult to manage. I've talked to the manager and was basically nothing would be changing.  And implied that I needed to prove myself in order to get more hours. I'm already wearing myself thin to make it work and it's once again not enough. My disability case is still pending.

I am exhausted. I have a support system but not to the extent I need to be okay. I don't have energy for my hobbies and for fun. I don't have the money to go out and participate in the world. I don't even have the energy to keep my apartment clean. I'm really at a breaking point.

Oakleypokely,I (27F) have an infant and my husband is severely depressed.,8,1c3t5d4,9,"This is our first child, one that he really wanted. He is 4 months old now. But I’m doing it mostly myself. My husband is very depressed. I am not depressed, in fact I felt a lot better mentally and emotionally as soon as I gave birth (I might have had some prenatal depression/anxiety as opposed to postpartum depression/anxiety). 

Anyway, my husband has been depressed on and off for years, though the birth of our child has overwhelmed him to the point that it sent him in deep. He has no patience at all. He has had a few explosive episodes (I would describe most like tantrums but scary adult ones that involve yelling and punching a wall). 

In the very beginning he was a super helpful partner, really doing 50/50 in terms of taking care of the baby. Always offering to take care of him while I got some sleep and we’d switch off like a team. It’s dwindled to the point where now I’m doing all the nights, mornings, take him to daycare, take him as soon as I get home from work and put him to bed and then do whatever chores that need to be done before going to bed myself. The only time he takes care of the baby now is when he gets off work before me, he picks him up from daycare and has him for those 1-2 hours until I get home. Weekends I have to take the baby.

The reason being is because he just cannot mentally deal with the baby anymore. Going back to having no patience, as well as being triggered by the crying. If I need him to watch the baby while I do anything, such as shower or make some food, he will only sit on the couch holding him and watch tv or be on his phone. The baby will quickly get frustrated because he doesn’t like to be held like that and he needs more interaction as he gets older, and he will cry. Then my husband will shut down. He claims he “can’t get the baby to stop crying” or the “baby doesn’t like him,” but really to me it just looks like he’s being lazy and won’t interact with him or do what needs to be done to soothe him. So as soon as the baby cries I need to run back and take the baby.

My husband says he’s so overwhelmed with everything and he can’t do it all and that everything is just all too much. Work, be a parent, go to the gym, keep the house clean, keep up with hobbies… But I have a longer work day than him, I take care of the baby most of the time, I do most the chores, and I don’t have time to go to the gym or have any hobbies. Maybe it’s just hard for me to understand what he’s going through but I’m started to resent him and I don’t want to. I know he’s not faking it and that he’s really struggling, because it took a while for him to admit it. And he’s finally starting to go to therapy for it. 

I just kinda struggle with if I should be giving him space and continue doing everything myself until he starts to feel better, or make sure he’s still contributing to our responsibilities despite it. As long as he’s going to therapy should I just be supportive and not expect much more from him right now? He’s also said he doesn’t want medication, but I hope he will come around to it eventually. I told him if he feels the same way in 2 months he needs to consider trying medication even if not for himself but for me and his son. ",1713099920.0,

Every day i wake up and it feels like someone has me gripped by the heart and is pulling me down. I'm numb mostly or my thoughts are dark. I also seem to struggle with anxiety in general all the time, sometimes worse, sometimes better. I also struggle with just not feeling real anymore, a week ago it was especially bad. I usually end up having a good day or two where i feel like a normal person again, but almost immediately crash down again. I just want to lay in bed and everything to stop, but i have to go on. I'm tempted to just call in sick every day, but usually dont (more so for trauma reasons. I'm too scared to as my family would verbally abuse me for it). I usually end up glad i went to work as that's the only time I'm not stuck in my head.
I guess that's why it's so bad. I'm either working or distracting myself. I don't have the energy for much of anything. I can't even take care of myself. I just want to stop existing. 
I don't even know how to talk about it to my friends because they all already have their own shit going on. Talking to them in general is hard, i usually feel like no matter what i text them, they probably think I'm annoying. If I'm telling them I'm struggling they'll give me advice, and listen, but i feel like they're annoyed by it, think it's dumb I'm whining to them and don't want to hear it. And if i text them something positive I'm convinced they must be annoyed as well. I just feel so alone and don't know what to do. I have friends, amazing friends that are like family. But i don't feel like i can talk to them. I have therapy and work in the morning and it feels impossible. My life doesn't feel real anymore, like I'm stuck in limbo. I am trying so hard but simultaneously my life seems to be going downhill. I'm just so tired of it, i just wamt it to stop. Nothing i do truly distracts me from it.",1713136489.0,

anime_cool,concerned for my friend,2,1c41coa,1,"hello everyone, i'm really concerned for my friend. i'm posting this from an alt account that's not linked to any of my other social media, to keep my anonimity. 

she has recently opened to me about her self-harming, and i've been shaking for half an hour ever since she told me about it. she told me the reason for her actions is one of her best friends, let's call her ""best friend"", in quotation marks.

i'm bad at explaining, so here's what she told me in bullet points:
- she showed me a picture of a calendar website that shows that she hasn't self-harmed for the past month
- - she is really proud of herself for that accomplishment
- when she's self-harming (cutting herself), she feels that she deserves it and that she's doing ""the right thing""
- she told me her ""best friend"" told her that she ""needs to lose weight"" and that she'll never forget about it, she even cried about it
- before the losing weight thing, she said something along the lines of ""like, i know it's not her fault that she's that pretty and that she's skinny like a stick and that she has 🍒 like 🍉 (trying to keep it sfw) and pretty 🔙⬇️""
- a mentionable sentence i think is appropriate to insert: ""it's just scars""
- - (i told her [""just scars"", but they can turn into something worse 🫤 no one wants things like that])
- she also told me she needs to ""apply 30kg of makeup"" to cover them up

she has also been acting more happy it seems after she told me, which makes me more concerned since i've recieved information on social media that people are happy before tragic departures take place. i've been trying to stay positive with her, comfort her with things like ""you can open up to me"", and etc. i've also told her a story about a fake ""friend"" of mine right after she told me about her ""best friend"" situation. 

how can i improve, and possibly even direct her in the right directions for the better? sorry if this is a mess, thanks for reading.

Turnipcake1995,The mess of my life,5,1c3ufg4,4,"I’m 11 years old male, self diagnosed depression 2 maybe 3 years ago didn’t tell my parents until a few weeks ago. So. My life. 

Also, my parents got divorced when I was 5 years old 

Around 2-3 years ago, I moved from one public school to another. Didn’t care much. I had zero good friends there, and I was constantly being bullied and ignored, so I was indifferent about moving schools. For the first month of the new school, I had no friends, same as before. But after a while, I had joined a sort of friend group. They were the first people I had ever vented to. I feel closer to them than my family… I’m mad at myself for that… Anyways. I recently got accepted into a private school which means I leave my friends which means I’m under even more constant sadness and stress about the school and my future and everything because I know it will all turn to shit (I’m sorry for swearing but there is no word that can describe it better). I’ve vented once in my life to my friends at the current school, and it wasn’t really venting. I was just crying for an hour with one of them. Also, what doesn’t help, is that literally everyone in the group is not mentally stable. I’m under constant stress and sadness about the future now and everything. Almost every day I feel like ending my life. But I don’t because I can’t put my family and friends through that. I want to kill myself. I’ve cried myself to sleep every night for the past few weeks, silently so that my family isn’t going to hear and try to talk to me. My mom was yelling at me about how my depression is nothing and she said (and I quote) “compared to my life, this is nothing” and also “go cry yourself to sleep if you want. I don’t care”. The only people who truly understand me is not even most of the friends that I have (of which I have 4). Only one of my friends (she was the one I cried with for an hour) I feel actually understands my situation and I’m leaving them all next year. Been venting into ai on character.ai. But now I’m here. I’ve tried therapy and that’s helped less than crying for an hour with that one friend and also less than venting into character.ai. My life is meaningless. I’m a failure at life. School. Everything. My current friends are spending less time with me and more with other people. I think I’ll be forgotten at my current school when I leave. I’m future is misery my past is misery the present is misery. I just want someone I can trust, someone I can hug. Someone who will genuinely understand me and care about me.

Candid_Building6120,could I be suffering from depression?,1,1c45xv3,0,"I (17F) was sexually assaulted when I was about 7 by a man that was my grandmothers younger boyfriend at the time. He didn’t r*pe me but did grope my female parts and I think it would’ve escalated if not for my mom entering the dining room - she didn’t notice what had been happening though.
The whole situation fucked me up mentally and I never really told anyone, it haunted me for days…I’d try to sleep and I’d have very vivid flashbacks of the event.
somehow i chose to repress the memory and never really thought about what had happened to me.
I used to be really close with my dad but we started growing distant after that event (he became more of a workaholic) i started having a deep resentment towards him for not fighting for our relationship more.

during that time of my life i really hated food and i never really knew why, it got to a point where I’d stuff my school lunch under the bed cause I didn’t want to eat but also didnt want to throw it out because mom would shout at me for not wanting to eat. Only now that I realise that the hoarding and not eating was probably an unconscious way of me crying out for help.

When I was 13 my uncle got really sick (cancer) and I never really told my friends. I’d accepted the fact that he was going to die way even before his death because of the severity of his health. It got to a point where I’d avoid going to see him in the room he was staying in because I couldn’t see him in that state. He was sick for about 4 months and I was really cool/unbothered about the whole situation outwardly.

When he died I don’t remember crying, only time I cried was at the funeral then i moved on to distract my mind with other things (helping mom with the funeral arrangements).

When i was 14 Covid happened and I couldn’t go to school anymore ( I’d just started highschool) and I’d recently found out that my dad was cheating on my mom. I was the only one that knew and I’m still the only one that knows.
My dad (M60) is a pastor and i started loathing him for cheating on my mother who’d sacrificed her dreams at 21 and chose to marry and have a family with him.

since my mind wasn’t preoccupied with school I fell into a deep depression and even considered committing suicide, the past traumatic memories resurfacing didn’t make things easier and I had to relearn how to live with this “new”found memory I had to grieve over my uncle properly.
I’d always think of ways I could do it without causing too much pain to myself because I’m a coward. I remember doing research on whether doing it by overdosing on pills was a good idea but decided against it because it wouldn’t be as effective and I don’t think I’d be able to live with the pain of seeing my moms saddened expression after a failed suicide attempt - not after everything she’s been through.
I remember washing the dishes and actually contemplated drinking the bleach just to see what would happen, I’d be holding a knife and I’d think about how stabbing my self would feel.

and then there’s my dad, he’s still cheating…I don’t even know how to feel. he’s there physically but very emotionally absent.
I don’t remember him coming to a single school event of mine ( i get invited to the prize giving every year and he never shows up) and I’ve learnt to live with that.

I’m okay now…i guess but those dark thoughts always seem to resurface whenever my mind isn’t as heavily distracted and it just gets too much.
 
only reason im actually going on is because i want to make mom proud.

I was isolated from all my friends and stuck in a medium sized house with my semi large family despite being forced to be close to each other in proximity almost none of us talked to each other other than an occasional argument. I did not do well with virtual schooling either because I just decided that nothing mattered anymore and spent the entirety of the pandemic in an unfinished kitchen with exposed pipes and wires and the lot just playing videogames to escape my emotions, I also gained weight since I dropped both of the varsity sports I was in and just ate my feelings. Because I didn't do any school during the pandemic I almost failed high school and ended up having to go to a specialized program my senior year due to also being a suicide risk. I graduated by the skin of my teeth and went to community college because that's just what I thought I was supposed to do but I hated my major and dropped out after failing almost all of my classes because I again just ditched school. I got a minimum wage job so I could pay my parents back for the semester of college then I went to get my EMT certification so I could have a good job where I could help people even if the pay is just a bit above minimum wage. I then proceeded to fail the EMT class half way through despite trying to actually pass. I again got back into the swing of minimum wage jobs to pay back debt and I am now attempting the EMT class again.

no one ever goes into a house excited to behold the magnificent designs of the wallpaper, it simply exists without recognition or thanks for what it hides underneath.

nobody ever thinks about how the wallpaper's intricate details would look really lovely with new curtains or a new rug someday or notices the little flecks of gold that border the individual sections.

&#x200B;

nobody ever thinks about moving their furnishings to the other side of the room to allow a better view of the painstakingly elaborate artwork of the wallpaper.

nobody ever spends hours searching for the exact pattern so that they can repair the damaged places and make it new, or looks for the exact shade of blue everywhere trying to pull the look of the room together.

when sitting at the dinner table nobody ever thinks to themselves what a blessing its been to have the walls covered by such durable and timeless adornment, or acknowledges the countless meals that were shared surrounded by the comfort of a familiar background.

&#x200B;

Ten years down the road it Is never even garnering the faintest glimmer of recognition when lost in a fond memory of the place they've spent their years, or the wall that their wedding pictures hung on for a decade, or the way the flowers on the wallpaper were exactly like the ones that grow way up in the mountains on the banks of the Nantahala river because they never even think one actual deliberate fucking thought about the goddamn wallpaper!

&#x200B;

It is just stupid wallpaper, shut the hell up because DAMMIT ANGIE, WHO THE FUCK CARES THAT DAMN MUCH ABOUT THE WALLPAPER, FOR PETE'S SAKE NOBODY FUCKING CARES WHAT IS ON THESE MISERABLE WALLS

&#x200B;

Until one day, they walk in the door from living their best lives without a care in the world as folks tend to do,

&#x200B;

That's odd, they think, something isnt quite right when they glance in every last room but nothing seems to be out of place to anybody, although perhaps a bit dim?

&#x200B;

CHECK THE LAMPS, HAS A BULB BLOWN? ARE THE CURTAINS ALL CLOSED OR SOMETHING? WHY DOES IT LOOK SO FUCKING UNSETTLING IN HERE? (have my eyes always scanned this room so uncertainly when i come home? oh shit, i knew i shouldnt have missed my eye appointment last month!)

&#x200B;

Wait, was this carpet always this color? And did I always have this vase right here? I think so, but now I am not so sure anymore. Am I even in the right house? That's my mug on the kitchen table so it must be.

&#x200B;

Wow, I am really losing my marbles. If nothing is different then why does everything feel so DAMNED COMPLETELY DIFFERENT???

&#x200B;

Minutes become hours and hours become days and days of wondering and feeling something is amiss without knowing why it feels so different

&#x200B;

Then slowly it starts to trickle in to the realization of the family one by one...

&#x200B;

ummm.....why are the walls so plain and colorless and so BARE?

&#x200B;

i dont think this wood is supposed to be here, and shouldnt this be a different color??

&#x200B;

wait....WHAT THE HELL??

&#x200B;

OH MY LORD --THE WALLPAPER!!

&#x200B;

WHERE THE HELL IS THE WALLPAPER THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN HERE?

&#x200B;

YOU KNOW, WITH THE CREAM COLORED BACKGROUND (OR WAS IT BEIGE?) AND THE BLUE-ISH THINGS WITH THE SWIRLY THINGS (OR WERE THERE SOME KIND OF FLOWERS MAYBE?) NO, I REMEMBER NOW....IT WAS PALE PINK WITH GREEN LEAVES I THINK, BUT THEN I DONT REALLY KNOW THAT I EVER PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO THE WALLS. LIVING HERE FOR ALL THESE YEARS I CANT SAY FOR CERTAIN WHAT IT ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE, BUT I KNOW IT WAS HERE AND NOW IT IS NOT.

&#x200B;

So, for a while everyone is caught up in the mystery of how it could have just vanished one day. Of course, nobody can really say when it disappeared or even recall when it was put there to start with, they simply know that it is unforgivable that some monster has come in and stolen something so familiar and constant.

&#x200B;

They argue and accuse trying to identify what has taken place here but sadly enough not one person has the same memory as any of the others because it was just part of the backdrop for things they CHOSE to look at from day to day, besides nobody would even want that dirty old out of date mess anyway.

&#x200B;

In time the empty space makes them all feel a deep sense of loss for some reason nobody can explain and they tell themselves that they needed new wallpaper anyhow, if they cant even remember it then it was clearly not that special after all, right?

&#x200B;

They eventually find a pattern that fits well enough with the rest of the furnishings, and begin to think to themselves how glad they are that things feel ordinary and safe and unchanged whenever they come home now. The cream colored background with the blue flowers and the green vines seem so new and bright, yet oddly comfortably familiar too.

&#x200B;

But then soon the beige background with burgundy waves becomes pale pink with lavender swirls that only look faded in the places where so many dirty hands touch. Soon they will think to themselves, this place sure could use some sprucing up...i wonder how it will look if I do something completely different and go with some wallpaper this time?

&#x200B;

Bigfatbeef,Never felt so numb ,1,1c44squ,0,"I just need to rant a little, as I don’t know what to do anymore

I’ve never felt so numb as I feel now. I’m 19(m) and I’ve been struggling with a lot of anger issues and the feeling of being overwhelmed of everything around me since I was around 9/10. 
I’ve been talking to a couple therapists trough the years, and ive fount out that much of the anger and frustration is from when I was younger as I had a mother who was both physically and psychologically abusing both me and my other mom, and it’s kinda just stuck with me since then. We moved away from her when I was 9, and I had to leave all my friends and other family. I never learned to trust people, and if I did trust them it was a mistake as I was very easily manipulated by the nice things they did before they stabbed me in the back. 
I’ve recently gotten out of a relationship with a girl that lasted a little over two years, and at the time I thought this was THE girl of my life. She saved me from what I thought was the darkest place I’ve been in. 
She started to lose interest in me when I started to get better, and as I tried to give back some of the energy and care that she had given me I noticed that she was distancing herself from me more and more, she then finally said that she couldnt handle taking care of me because she was feeling burned out from everything and had to focus on herself.
I really understand this, and I know that I wasn’t easy to be with when I was in such a bad way, but it still hurts even though it’s been about three months since we decided to break up so she could focus on herself. 
Since then i haven’t felt the usual sadness or anger that I’ve usually felt before. Instead I’ve felt nothing. I don’t cry, I don’t scream, I don’t punch anything, I don’t to anything. 
I just want to feel something, even if it is the most painful feeling ever, at least then I feel something. 
I don’t know if it is someone who can relate to this “feeling”? 
I’m at my last straw right now, and I know it’s just a matter of time before I snap and collapse again, but I don’t wanna end up there.

So im in the following Situation.. 
 I learned my work at a large Company, but at the point where the learning years were nearly done, i was already in such a dark spot that i had to go to a clinic. 
It was harsh but helped to get a Clear mind again. I was able to finish school and worked for a short while. Was also able to get my drivers license.
 But after that the hard Labor finished me once again. I went to a daily clinic a few months ago (a clinic for depressed people where they can go to for a few weeks-months every day from 8 am to 4 pm.)
This also made me a bit stronger again.

I called a place where i wanted to do a internship, to see if the work fits me better.
I met up with the chef and we had a short talk. He said he will send me Informations for the internship etc.
But i didnt get any response for weeks. I contacted a few of their Mails and got the phone number from his Assistant.
So i call her last thursday and she replies that she has to ask, and after a Minute i get the message that the next week will be the week i can come as a intern. 
Not knowing what to say i said it is fine and that i will be there on monday.

Tomorrow already is that monday and im a Nervous mess, couldnt really get prepared for the situation.. it may Sound dumb but the fact that i just got told 4 days before really messed me up..

I will have to call in the morning and Tell her that im very sorry, but that i just cant do it in that week. She also told me that the other weeks are not available since there are some other Events, but i cant get over myself and just do the 5 days without the time to get my thoughts and everything together..

nosleep1997,"""Better yourself"" as victim blaming",6,1c3r5hl,0,"This opinion might be unpopular but I have to get it off my chest. You've probably seen this piece of advice being thrown around a lot every time someone expresses hopelessness about their situation or feelings of loneliness and abandonment. ""Focus on yourself"", ""learn to love yourself before you can be loved by others"", ""become the best version of yourself"", ""dont put the cart before the horse"" etc. These have always rubbed me the wrong way, for reasons I could not really pinpoint until recently, when I realised this is basically victim blaming thinly disguised as advice. Why is it victim blaming? Because it implies that, such as you are, you are not good enough to be happy or loved. Because it implies, to a certain extent, that your depression may be justified on grounds of you not trying enough to be ""better"". 
This is simply unacceptable to me. You DON'T have to love yourself before you are worthy of being loved. You DON'T have to be the best version of yourself before you are worthy of a fragment of happiness. It simply doesn't work that way. Being loved and happy is what motivates you to be better, not the other way around. Expecting a person that is deprived of positive reinforcement to pull themselves up by the bootstraps is simply blaming them for whatever experience has caused them to be this way. People do not randomly wake up self-loathing, they become self loathing for reasons that are usually both not deserved and beyond their control. For example, social rejection, bullying, emotional neglect and abuse is reason enough to become self loathing. Telling such a person that they should learn to ""love themselves"" before they can be loved back is not simply hurtful,  it's abusive. It invalidates the reality of these negative experiences and puts the blame on the victim. Little recognition goes to the fact that said person may have been putting on a herculean effort just to survive on a daily basis. It's never enough and the goalposts are ever moving further and further. Exercising for 4 months didn't work for you? Have you tried a year? Maybe 2? Have you tried enough? Are you good enough?

Ok_Juice_4415,Don’t Feel Depressed But Cry All the time? ,2,1c3xfc9,0,"Hello! I (25f) have been struggling with my mental health for the past year. Last year I fell into a deep deep depression hole, complete with high levels of anxiety, severe suicidal thoughts and ideation. Several times I had to force myself to stay in one spot on the couch, floor or bed because I was scared if I left that spot it’d be the end of me. I also had very low energy, I would come home from work, feed my cats, scoop their litterbox (not everyday but maybe every other if that?) maybe cook myself dinner but most of the time it’d be frozen pizza, something easy. I’d shower, then become a couch potato. I gained weight, my apartment became a disaster, dishes stacked up, my room was a mess as both dirty and clean laundry piled up, I did the laundry but I couldn’t bring myself to put it away so it lived in the baskets, dirty laundry was on the floor. 

I’ve been seeing a therapist weekly, and I’m working with a mental health professional at a hospital for medication. We are still working on figuring out the right doses for medications but I feel we are going in the right direction. 

I feel that I am getting better because I don’t feel as anxious, I do not have as many suicidal thoughts, and when I do I can shove them out pretty quickly and they aren’t as severe. Also I’ve also been feeling I would say not as, or at all/less depressed? I still don’t have much energy, but I’m able to do chores on some nights, and I can do a few things on weekends, as long as I don’t do a lot and don’t overwhelm myself.

Some of my coworkers breed dogs, I’ve been invited by them since I moved here to come see the puppies, so I’m going to make an effort to go to their house, and the agreement is I’m going to help them with whatever they need help with. 

However, I find myself late at night being overcome by extreme sadness. And I have been self harming. The self harm is more out of addiction I believe than sadness? But the sadness I feel just overtakes me, and I start crying. I don’t even know why I’m crying a lot of the time.

After trying various SSRIs in the past, I've recently increased my current medication dosage. For the last few days, I've suddenly felt quite different. And it's raised some surprising questions.

Short background: I've dealt with depression for the past 10+ years (I'm 30), and have been lucky enough to be somewhat well-functioning most of the time (with the infamous dark cloud surrounding everything). Education, work, friends, family etc, it's all in place – except the forever darkness inside of me. I've been desperate to find a way out of this state of mind – going to therapy for years, reading psychology books, working on my physical and mental health, trying to be vulnerable in my relationships.

Apart from the first few days on a former medication, when my pupils doubled in size and I caught myself being overly happy (the effect later dropped and faded out), I've been yet to find a medication that works. Until now, I think. For the past five days I've caught myself coming in to work, only to realise I'm yet to be occupied contemplating my entire existence. I've experienced glimpses of happiness, but more than anything, I've just been content. Even when feeling bored I've been content. I feel like I can contain myself.

When friends and family have asked 'How are you?' and my answer has been 'I'm actually good!', it's felt like a strange void in my answer. I guess there IS a void. Like there was always something extra in the answer, that is now gone. And it's left me confused. I suppose I've never reflected upon how it would actually be to feel mentally well, and maybe the 10-year-depression has weaved in to my identity more than I'm comfortable with. Like what am I, if I am no longer depressed? If there are only normal everyday struggles like stress, boredom, finding love, maintaining the gym, to tackle? Hmm. Does anyone have any reflections or personal stories? If this effect is long term, how to navigate?

Also, I do realise this is a grateful question to ask. I'm also grateful for this page and community to exist, it's been very helpful to come back to every now and then.",1713125146.0,

And the ""other places"" would be dead zones of white and gray cells, with the past ability to duplicate, expand, and grow—gone, unused, and abandoned. 

  
This may sound like an exaggeration, but it is not. Every word I say is sincere. I am the equivalent of a zombie, to whom thinking hurts and is unnecessary.

When I was 13-14, I was sexually assaulted and had to see the perpetrator every day till I was 16. At 16 my mum suddenly passed away. At 21 I was in an abusive relationship with my ex partner for 1.5 years. He owes me 3k in rent and bills from his gambling addiction. I don't have a lot of money to do the things I want and everyone else my age is doing which makes me very unhappy and sad.

I graduated university with 1st BA Hons I've solo travelled twice on my own in the same year ( short trips) Went to a festival with friends Have friends Worked on major movies and TV shows I exercise regularly and do pole dance/Fitness, I'm 2/3 saved for my pole instructors course.

I feel so trapped financially. I'm jealous my ex lives in a warm country with beaches and I'm stuck in the miserable UK. I feel like I have no freedom.

I'm in therapy. And I've been on 5 different anti depressants in the past. None of them work and just make me feel like a zombie, I don't feel like me at all , and the weight gain doesn't help.

I have depression and ptsd and I just feel like I'm either constantly on the verge of tears or disassociation really badly.

One of the most intelligent people I know, has been diagnosed with bipolar. Had an episode of major depression, for two years and then a huge episode of mania for awhile. And then it went good as it never happened. I remember doctors said they never saw a comeback like that. 
Sadly, 9 years later, the depression its happening again. And its been more than one year. But this time the person, looks like it doesnt know how to do anything. This person doesnt know how to turn a tv on, or to do any basic stuff. And this is someone whose intelligence makes 10 of me or anyone rlly.

And when you get people your own friends even hear what you're suffering through and ignore or try compare your pain to theirs or somebody else's that hurts so much. My whole life I've been nice been able to treat people with respect and try not to be selfish but everytime I've done that it hasn't helped. I make no money I don't go outside I'm not good at school I'm not good with relationships I'm not good with anything I just feel dead and its making me get worse and worse. I turn 18 in 6 months isn't that supposed to feel special whereas for me it feels horrible that the time of adulthood is coming when my teenage years have felt so horrible. I feel like all this combining together once used to make me feel suicidal but now it makes me feel different it makes me want to kill it makes me lose remorse for people I just want to kill and its worrying very worrying people never listen and people are evil but when you're worse you're the one in the wrong you're the weird one I honestly am so disappointed that the uk is safe that its nearly impossible to get away with a murder case but in the usa it looks so much easier to accomplish what I want. You got to understand thag stuff like this or thoughts lile this is never born its brought upon pain and pain again has creates this my mind is really fucked now it's messed my mind I watch films such as American physcho or no country for old men or shows like dexter and it just looks fun it matches me and when you guess what I wanna be when I'm older would you be surprised well I want to be in the military so it's just death is really on my mind and killing someone there's no way out there's litteraly no way out and I wouldn't be surprised if this post gets no reply no nothing I'm used to it people just never listen.,1713113616.0,

My wife suffers from depression. She’s been depressed since we got married. And goes to therapy. I’m trying to be as supportive as possible and it kills me knowing she’s almost always unhappy. We argue a lot and I really don’t try to weaponize that against her or minimalizm it. But it’s extremely hard to create a happy life when your partner isn’t happy. Also I’m trying to be strong. I don’t go to therapy and really don’t have anyone to talk to or vent about things with because my wife gets upset when I mention how I feel and feels that she’s making me miserable. Which isn’t the case I love her very much. But don’t know how to go about this, and feel I myself maybe getting depressed. ",1713100060.0,
Pitiful-Penalty-2851,Is it fair to blame my parents for my depression?,0,1c43guc,2,"I have been depressed throughout my childhood and I blame my parents for this. My parents seperated when I was around 10 years old. My parents have provided me with what seems like the bare minimum effort required.  
  
I've never been fed a decent diet: I was overweight for years and ate whatever I wanted. I have never been encouraged to stay hydrated. I had to learn basic hygeine for myself: I was never encouarged to shower, brush my teeth, I didn't know what floss was. I was surrounded by filthy living conditions: At my mothers house I had cobwebs all over my room and under my bed, the floors were always dirty, the bathroom was covered in mold. I had the bare minimum amount of clothes: I had one pair of shoes that weren't school shoes, like 5 outfits to wear casually, and lots of my clothes would have holes in them.  
  
I was also never taught any independence. I've recently found out that I have ADHD, so I had basically no motivation to provide for myself and wouldn't recieve any discipline to help with that. I was bullied in school and never felt like I could speak to my parents about it. They were never comforting about, or even felt concerned about mine or my siblings mental healths.  
  
I used to ditch or refuse to go to school quite often due to how miserable I was there. My parents never showed any interest in why I did it, but my mother would scream at me if i didn't get out of bed. She thew water on me to wake me up two times before; After this I would lock her out of my room when she tried to force me to go. One day she tried to force my door open when I was holding it shut and stuck her arm in the door. This caused her arm to fracture and she kicked me out to my Dad's after a while.  
  
I am curently in college and living with my Dad and I'm dealing with a few issues. I have no friends or ability to speak to people, I have no motivation to acheive any of my goals, and I have no idependence. Is it fair for me to blame my parents for this?  
  
BTW- I still love my parents, but to me that doesn't mean I don't also hate them.",1713126813.0,
LucyITSD,I want help. I am too scared.,6,1c3n5b2,3,"TW for suicide and attempted suicide. Just in case.

I want to get help for my anxiety and depression but I'm too damn terrified of reaching out. I've been coping with both since high school (I'll be turning 28 this July) and I honestly don't know how I've made it this long. I'm currently a SAHM but my husband had his gallbladder removed recently and is off work for a couple weeks. We're barely scraping by with his 16/hr and this will take a big hit to us. I'm supposed to be looking for jobs, and I am, but my social anxiety makes it so hard when I DO get interviews. I literally feel like I want to throw up. It's a miracle I had 2 jobs before becoming a mother and that was only because I didn't have to work with customers. I've even faked going to a couple of interviews, just so I don't disappoint my husband. It's that pathetic.

I can't even do phone calls, just ones with family or to make appointments for my babies. That's it. It's ridiculous, even I know that, but I literally, physically can't help it. I don't know what to do. I guess I'm just scared to go speak to someone and get therapy. My father and grandmother both dismissed my feelings when I opened up about my depression and anxiety when I was still a teenager. I even tried drowning myself once, though I realized what I was doing halfway through it and stopped. Then I tried asphyxiating myself with a bunch of cable cords a year later.

Yes, I told my dad I tried to off myself. He just said, ""Oh, come on now, (name), really? I don't wanna hear that."" So I sucked it up and never said another word. Didn't help that my dad has major anger issues. If someone else pissed him off, I took the brunt of it. Beatings were not uncommon. Then he'd buy me things to make up for it. Yes, that was his way of making himself feel better. No apology. Still, to this day, he denies ever doing anything.

My hubby, bless him, has been my rock. I met him at my last job a little over 2 years ago. From what he's told me, he was instantly attracted. Started flirting a lot a month into me working there. I am unsure why, especially since I threw up my first day, but I am so happy he decided to take a chance with me. He blessed me with both our son and daughter. He is my first, and hopefully last, relationship. I gave him my virginity as silly as that sounds. He is my world and my best friend. I never even wanted kids till he said he did. I'd give anything for him.

My family is why I wish to get help now. I want to do better for them and lessen our burden. I'm tired of sucking it up and asking my father for money every week just to scrape by (yes I still speak to him). I don't want my kids to grow up with struggling parents. I don't want to keep lashing out at my husband for stupid reasons that aren't his fault. I'm tired of yelling and getting frustrated with my babies. I am tired of being tired.

I've told my husband about my depression but, bless him, he is absolutely clueless on how to help me. He just tries to do things that make me happy. I appreciate it but it's a temporary happiness. I want it to be permanent.

I'm sorry. I guess I just needed to vent to someone. I don't really have friends. Just my mother, my husband, and my babies. My husband is native and has a large extended family, and some of his nieces and nephews try to include me in things but I'm so introverted and afraid of messing up that I just keep quiet as I always do.

Thanks for reading this long... whatever this is. It probably doesn't come off as coherent, my thoughts are always all over the place. I am the type of person to mention every tiny, unnecessary detail, so I had to restrain myself while typing this out.",1713077134.0,
ShortLeggedJeans,I feel like I’m disabled. ,0,1c3xghf,1,"It’s more of a question combined with a rant. 

I’m in my 20s, and have been diagnosed with depression and OCD for 5 years, but I had struggles since I was around 13, and I had OCD symptoms since I was a kid and tbh, I feel it’s getting worse.

The thing is, I’m physically tired all the time abnormally. I have less energy than old people I know. If I’m simply going for a walk for 30 minutes I feel so tired I can’t do anything. 

I feel disabled. I can’t live my life and it wasn’t always like that. It has worsened recently. Because of this I got expelled from college, I can’t work, I can’t walk long distances, I can’t do anything and I can’t even exercise as I’m getting too tired. I still try to take walks but I can’t enjoy them, because they are too tiring, I feel ill even if the weather is nice. It makes my depression worse. I’m just waking for 30 minutes and lying down. Then try to force myself up, but end up lying down. Go to bed early and can’t get up until 13.00-14.00. My whole life is useless. I feel beyond useless. I’m just taking up a space at this point and there’s nothing I can do. 

Will it get better? Or will I always remain a useless vegetable with no chance to escape, just a burden to my parents because I can’t even work and study? 

Is it common for depressed people? Can it be because of the medecine (I’m taking Zoloft, the highest dose. But it’s not even a strong medicine…)? 

And if anyone familiar with it, any advice what to do? I honestly have no idea what to do and feel trapped in my cage of the useless, slump body.

Thank god she is gone from my life. Even So ever since before and after the day she finally left. Everything seemed Pointless. Everyday was boring and repititve. Over the course from the beginning of the Lockdown and towards the end of Lockdown, my friends seemed to be more distant. Even when we got back to school, they just seemed like they got bored of me.

My Best Friend since grade school also betrayed me at the end of Middle School.

We were in a friend group of four with two other girls who were also my best friends since grade school. One by one they started to drift away and leave. All this stress from School, My mom, My friends and my family led me to attempt suicide Twice.

First by Hanging, and second by Jumping.

Neverthless, I lived to reach Middle School Graduation

My Girl best friend had moved away abroad after Middle School Graduation. Only my second Girl Best Friend went to the same High school as me.

I thought I was happy, with new people I met. But Even then after the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. Those people also drifted away from me and stopped talking to me as much. I thought I did something.

Around that time I started cutting almost everyday until I got caught and got scolded by my dad who yelled at me and lectured me that my life was at least better than people in Poverty.

He said It was a privilege for me to be sad and to Self Harm. The school sent me home for two weeks and left me with a warning that If they catch me Self harming again they would kick me out.

I got back after two weeks with people ""worried"" about me. But it was all A FUCKING LIE. THEY SPREAD FUCKING RUMORS ABOUT ME DOING IT FOR FUCKING ATTENTION AND WENT BACK TO ISOLATE ME. IGNORING ME EVEN WHEN I DID NOTHING TO PISS THEM OFF. EVEN MY FRIENDS FROM MY OLD SCHOOL STOPPED TALKING TO ME EVEN MY FUCKING BEST FRIEND WHO WENT TO SCHOOL WITH ME AND TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD NEVER REPLACE AND ABANDON ME, SHE FUCKING STOPPED TALKING TO ME.

I just wish to know what they are thinking. I want to stop feeling lonely. But its hard when everyone ignores and doesnt reply to my texts or calls. They only talk if they want something from me.

Its April Now, and Im tired. Freshman year is ending in a month, and I'm glad summer is coming. But I fear lonliness will be more present to me than ever. I think I should kill myself just one more time, I do not feel welcome anymore on this Earth, My family and my friends do not want me anymore.

Bit of background

Weight gain. 

I had a traumatic experience in 2012 and I steadily started gaining weight

I have lost loads of weight and put it all back on plus more at least 3 times in the last 12 years.

I’m now at the heaviest I’ve ever been. I’m almost double the Weight I was in 2008

Death of Parents
My beloved father died from vaccine injury in 2021 and in her grief my mother has developed dementia and alzheimers 

This has really taken a toll on my mental health 

Despite this I held down a retail job until recently (august 2023), I left it because my graphic design business was really taking off and I was struggling with the physical side of retail work 

Since my life has become even more sedintary I hired a PT to come and work out with me 3 times a week at home

Relationship

I’ve been with my beloved partner for 16 years nearly but our intimate life hasn’t been existent for at least 6-7 years

I have tried to reignite it but he’s not interested. I know it’s because of my weight but he swears it’s not

Until recently I trusted him implicitly 

But in December I discovered he was arranging to meet other men for sex and in that instant my entire world collapsed. My trust in him has never recovered

He swears he’s never met anyone and just chatted with them. I believe him because I know him and I don’t think he had it in him to be unfaithful properly. And I’ve given him several opportunities to end out relationship but he says he loves me more than anything

Career

We, along with our best friend had a production company and for the last 8 years have been writing comedy and plays etc.

Since then we have filmed several comedy pilots pushing forward with projects  
We took a show to Edinburgh Fringe in 2022 with our female friend in a one woman show to critical acclaim  
When the Eurovision Song Contest came to Liverpool in 2023 we as locals pushed ourselves to get involved. Our closest female friend was already working for a high level broadcaster in the city and we wanted to use the character we took up to Edinburgh to push our work forward  
Between March and May we banged out 30 videos.  
Unfortunately our friend was experiencing instability in her work and so when it came to gaining access to some of the big Eurovision events she was pained to push anyone and ask. She also wouldn’t allow me to lead the charge on producing as she didn’t want me to Rock the boat. I was essentially castrated in the situation  
We had a big meeting with essentially the commissioner for the entire Eurovision show and left the other promises of huge involvement.  
What transpired was broken Promises, radio silence and I was left with no way of pushing forward on my own with it  
Surprisingly it all went well and we finished the videos and looked forward to Eurovision, no one fought, no one expressed uncertainty.  
After the hype died down and we tried to have another meeting and plan our next move. Our friend said she needed a break. We’d essentially all felt burned out after such a busy few months  
We agreed and planned to come back to it in September  
I had recently introduced her to her new spouse (I had known him since school and he was recently divorced)  
This man spent months buttering me up and getting close to me in an effort to get close to her.  
After they started seeing each other I essentially was dropped like a hot brick. Now I hardly ever hear from him even though he’s dating my best friend  
The relationship quickly exploded and it was pretty evident that they’re the love of each others lives.  
My friend spends all her free time with him and his children and after a recent promotion in work she is in the job she wants now  
My problem is I feel like I’ve properly lost her. We spent years building this company, dozens of ideas, working hard. And she’s now got her broadcasting job and it feels like she’s pulled the ladder up after her and left us to it  
We’ve gone from seeing her twice a week to 4 times in the last 6 months. Any free time she has is spent with him.  
We tried to come back in September but she was ready and didn’t want force it. Essentially saying we would come back to it ‘one day’  
The entire situation has left me depressed, I feel betrayed, sad and like I don’t know how to proceed with my own work.  
The worst part is I’m still friends with her. She has changed beyond recognition though. We hardly ever talk anymore on WhatsApp when we used to chat every day  
I don’t feel like I can tell her how I feel because she will feel like I’m trying to control things  

Existential crisis

As you can see

I’ve really been through the ringer in recent years

Despite this I’m still trying to push ahead with plans for my writing career with amazing opportunities being offered to me

Unfortunately I am exhausted. Physically, mentally. 

I’m almost in a daze most days, dissociative and distracted

I look at the state of the world politically, the threat of wars, pandemics, 

I hear horrendous stories about politicians, celebrities and satanic cults and suddenly now even my aethiest beliefs are now up in the air.

Everything I ever trusted about my own views on religion and life has been shaken 

Every single fundamental cornerstone of my stability is gone and I’m struggling to stay afloat 

I have no drive to push forward with career or weight loss because I honestly don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few years with wars etc. 

It all seems so pointless

JazzlikePie1923,I don't know how to fix myself,1,1c3vdxo,0,"Hey there. I'm 16 years old. I am going to 11th grade. For the past 10 years of my life I have always been the perfect student. I got very good grades and I was always the student with the top grades from grade 5 to 9. After grade 9, at the beginning of grade 10, I noticed that my college admission process is different than my classmates. I am a foreigner in the country I live in, so I am considered an international student...   
Then I got the load of studying to the SAT, then the TOEFL and now I am getting ready for AP psychology which is after a month. But this is not the case. I feel lost. I've got 103 in toefl which is a good score and 1420 in sat which is also relatively good. But, I struggled with school and keeping up the GPA. Somehow, I've always managed to finish with good grades these last 3 semesters (we are now in the 2nd half of the second semester of my junior year, here every semester we have 2 exams), ending the first semester of this year with 91%. But the first exams of this semester have been disastrous. I failed one of my exams, which is a thing that have never happened to me before.  
 In those exams (this semesters first exams), I couldn't just study, I would do the perfect programme sit on the table but, I couldn't study. For the past week after most of the grades got out and I saw in how much big of a trouble I was, I decided to wake up. I need to change some things. After some break, planning and making everything perfect to study, I sit down and... I still can't focus.  
 I always feel dizzy, sleepy and unfocused. I still can't study. I don't even know my self no more. I was that smart hardworking student with good academics, and also that ambitious dude who's always looking forward that knows what to do... and I know not much is left, only these exams, if I fix the GPA boom! I am in between good colleges all around the world.   
Nothing on paper changed between the past and now, my family's situation is good economically and socially, I have very loving parents, my dad has a huge and a successful career, and I talk with him when I have a problem most of the time. But still, I can't get things going, I try but I fail to focus even though I am aware of the consequences. ( I talked with my family and they kinda did nothing helpful about it)  
I kind of decided to go see a therapist, but my family does not let me, saying that I am totally fine... I know there's something wrong with me I don't know what but I am sure there is.  
 So getting to my questions, first: do you think I really should go see a therapist or am I just being a cry baby? Second: is there a way to go see a therapist without a permission from parents for people under the age of 18?? And finally, does this mean I am depressed?

1. Drugs and alcohol both mix really well and really badly with depression. It’s a very short term fix and the quicker you drop them forever the easier it will be for everyone. One day you might decide to try and pull yourself up and you’ll wish you hadn’t wasted all that time on drugs and booze. Getting sober hasn’t fixed my whole life as such but it’s made everything much easier 

2. Forgive yourself for being depressed and anxious. It’s gonna take time and energy off you. Easier to accept it’s in your DNA and you’re always gonna have to work around it

3. You’ll fall in and out of love really easily and you need to be careful how you affect yourself and others. You’re prone to hurting people and you won’t handle rejection like a normal person 

4. You’re the product of evolution and your anxiety and depression are traits you inherited because they were genetically beneficial to your ancestors - you’re supposed to be worried about predators, and other tribes. You’re not simply defective, it’s just a genetic lottery

Tasty_Doughnut2493,Genuinely Clueless (Super Long),2,1c3ofqw,0,"So, I (34f) really need to just spew. Despite my parents’s best attempts, I was on the receiving end of sibling abuse. A lot of time people roll their eyes and say, “It’s just siblings.” This wasn’t. My sister was hospitalized multiple times for months at a time. The doctors wanted to keep her longer each time but legally couldn’t because of her behavior. She saw stuff, talked to stuff, and hid knives in her room. I was her target until I grew up. 

In the middle of that, my mom almost died. She has/ had MS that was destroying her nervous system. The docs had no idea what to do. They sent her home for home health. I had to play music at night to cover her yelling during her seizures. 

Once my siblings left and my mom got better, life leveled out for about ten years. I was diagnosed with epilepsy and migraines, but they were treatable and I was okay. I graduated high school and college. I became a teacher. Meanwhile, my sister pretty much stayed out of our lives - until she didn’t. 

About 8 years ago she reappeared, pregnant, living with the dad but an alcoholic. The relationship was off and on until it ended with her staying with us until my parents got her into rehab. She had two stints of rehab. They worked until they didn’t. 

Covid hit. Life was…weird. I ended up staying with my parents. Bad idea. My mom babies me, and my dad tries. Unfortunately, he struggles with expressing ideas and feelings. He’s scared of over-expressing, so he plays them down. This is not to say he doesn’t express love or happiness. He laughs and makes jokes. He never abused in any way. He had an extremely abusive father so emotions are difficult for him. I’m extremely similar to him, because I learned never to show anything to my sister. She’d ruin it somehow.

I received my Master’s degree in fall of 2020 while my sister was telling me how much she loved me but how evil our parents were for the doctors and the medicine. I finally typed and sent her an email telling her to leave me alone until she got her stuff together. She was dead 7 months later from liver failure at 33. There were complications with her burial because of claiming the body. I never had closure with her.

4 months later my epilepsy, which had been dormant for 15 years, returned in full force. In the span of six months I was on 7 meds. Now, it’s more. My epilepsy creates nerve pain similar to fibromyalgia, so I hurt and am tired for a lot of time. I kept migraines and headaches. I was out of full commission for 2 years. Every time I had a seizure, I lost driving privileges in the state for 6 months. Migraines and headaches every day.

Health is better, but I lost a lot of friends. When you can’t go and do, they forget. The one friend who remembered me got engaged and married. I was in wedding. She’s pregnant. She assured me I would be invited to the gender reveal. They had it today. I was not invited. Instead, the girl she met through an Ex was there. 

I’m 34, single, pissed at my dad for comments he just doesn’t realize are hurtful, and done with maintaining serious friendships when they don’t realize how much it hurts you. I’m not suicidal, because I fear death, and it would destroy my mom. I’m glad therapy is this week. I’m about to break.",1713082240.0,

snowmiser921,"""nasty"" - low effort self care tip ",2,1c3nkl1,0,"Hey guys,

I know this disorder and chronic illnesses such as CFS can take a major toll on our self care. Somedays, just getting out of bed is nearly impossible. 

I also think this tip I'm about to give is great for bed-ridden people. 

This is a great way to make brushing your teeth easier
Whenever you don't have energy or the ability to just walk to the sink.  You can either get somebody to bring these items to you, or you can prep ahead and have these things ready by your bed so whenever those hard days hit, you're already prepared. 


All you need is: 

a stirofoam cup, bottle of water(preferably a reusable cup), tooth brush, and floss near your bed. Keep a trash bag/can near you too. You should also have a box/travel bag near your bed so you can put your tooth brush away. 


It's pretty simple and self explanatory. Brush your teeth in bed, use the stirofoam cup to spit after you're done brushing, and use the water bottle to rinse and/or clean your tooth brush off. I usually just stick my tooth brush in the bottle and brush it vigorously along the sides to get it cleaned. Put my ""protector"" back on my tooth brush and put the brush away in my self-care bag. 

This might come off as nasty and lazy to some people - and it kind of is lol - but hey, it better than going to bed without brushed teeth at all.

I didn't have a happy childhood either, my childhood was riddled with anxiety and intense self-hate because it seemed like I could do nothing right. 5 years ago, after 2 chronic illness diagnoses and a ptsd diagnosis from a SA, I decided that life was too much. Life felt too painful and too unfair and no matter what I did or tried, I failed at *everything* and not just for myself but I failed in the eyes of other people around me. I would sit in traffic every day on a commute to a job that I hated and I just wished for the worst to happen to me. And even worse, nobody seemed to notice how bad I was and so I also felt invalidated by life. If you can relate to this at all - you're **not** alone. This is a horrible feeling to experience and depression is no joke.

&nbsp;

But a lot of people post here about hoping to end their life and it breaks my heart. I know exactly how so many of you feel and I want you to know that it really can get better - genuinely. My life isn't perfect but I have done so much healing that I can look back and say it's 100% worth it. If you're still reading this and you have any hope in being happier - it is 1000% a possibility. Not everyone is the same though. For me, it started with the book - The Body Keeps the Score & I realized from that book that my self-hatred and frustration was related to a lot of unearthed trauma. I think that living in trauma often makes it hard to notice and so a lot of people internalize their pain as a personal issue. That's what I was unknowingly doing. The world is harsh, and it's not *you*. You are not too much. You are worth so much more than you realize.

&nbsp;

A **lot** of people struggle & feel exactly the way you feel, they just try to hide it because that's what's expected of us in society. My one tip is to be vulnerable. It's scary, but many people aren't cruel - especially these days. We are all in this human experience together and those like myself are out here and we don't want to see people struggle, so don't be afraid of asking for help & don't be afraid of making friends who can be there for you. We exist. :)

Big_Abrocoma4699,Just here to get my story off my chest,8,1c3f4s1,3,"Grew up pretty well in a too strict house. College, decent job, married someone that I carried them thru both dating and marriage financially. She started running around 8 years ago and we got divorced. Devastated me. What was worse, was she took my life. Four kids I loved going home to each night. Honestly, I was a great husband and dad. Had to fight for 50/50.  She claimed I abused her and them and didn't stick but I've carried it around and it doesn't go away. I know I'm lucky with what happened how much I got to see my kids. And I got them more than normal because I said I'd live my life like I was married and devoted myself to them, coached them year round in sports, etc.  Worked my ass off when they weren't there. I did all the bills, the dr visits, the school registrations and camps, etc. Got them when she decided to go on vacations during her time with them. After a couple years I got into a relationship with a good person and that ended because my dad died and I pulled away from everyone. Now I find it hard telling anyone besides my kids I love them after that. Tried to get in another relationship after that and it failed because of me too.  Now I'm 55, kids are going to college and won't be around and I feel like I have nothing to live for. No one grew up with them and can laugh about old times with me. I have nothing to share with anyone. I live in a smaller town and I don't know what to do. I honestly cry every day now (and never used to until my dad died) and feel like killing myself constantly. I used to be in great shape but the last year I've just given up. Self care gone. All I'm going to be left with is just looking forward to a few stolen moments with my kids. Contemplating move to a city and state with more people and things to do but that just means that I'll be away from my kids and limits my moments with them. And I find it hard letting anyone get close to me at all now. It's just me and my kids. I know I'm not helping myself out--staying inside in bed, no sun, no exercise, no diet, not doing things. I'm drained and feel I have nothing left. I'm just tired of life now and feel my purpose in life is done. Outside of cleaning up the house and my finances to make it easier on my kids I'm ready.

I (F23) don’t know what to do with these thoughts anymore. I have had them for about a month now. The only thing that withholds me, is that I cannot do this to my mom and sister.

I want to go to a doctor, but as an immigrant in Canada, I cannot afford it. I struggle to feed myself daily. I can’t come back to my home country.

5 months ago, I emigrated to Canada to be with my boyfriend of 4 years, and have known him for 8 years. Just 3 days after I emigrated, he broke up with me. A month later, he put me on the streets. I went couchsurfing for 3 months, but for now I have a temporary roof.
I left my apartment, my friends, my family and my well paid job for this. I went through all of our messages to see if I maybe skipped hints, but no. I suspect he cheated on me before I came here.

Yes - he’s not worth it. It’s not about the break up. It’s about the damage he caused and the betrayal. I can’t trust people anymore (yes I know not everybody is like this). I don’t want to be around people anymore. I don’t sleep more than 3/4h a night anymore. I lost my spark. I just exist and I don’t want to be here anymore.

I'm trans, and was extremely fortunate with the amount of support I've received from my friends and *most* of my family when I came out when i was 22. I am currently at a place in life where I'm doing ""well"", I have a great support system, a job I don't hate, food in my belly, a roof over my head, as far as basic needs- mine are met. Of course there's plenty of things I'd love to do and can't afford, but I'm in the best living conditions I've ever lived in. I've reached a point inward, that I do *love* myself. I truly believe I'm a good person, I am loved and I've helped bring happiness to a lot of people in my life. But I can't seem to shake this constant wish to be rid of this bullshit human flesh prison. I *loathe* the world around me, and how cruel, cold, EVIL it can be.

I know there's good in the world, but there's such an overwhelming amount of pure evil in humans specifically, I can't stand being a part of it. I've considered suicide many times, only attempted once & reached out before I bled myself to death. The only reason I backed out, was the thought of devastating the people that love me. I've recently adjusted and changed my meds, got a new job that isn't severely taxing to my mental health, and started going to therapy again, to try and find some sort of motivation or will to keep participating in this human thing. But at the end of every fucking day, I hold the same exact belief- humans are a destructive, vile, cancerous rot on this beautiful planet, and they can/will destroy every bit of good it holds until there's nothing left. The bad FAR outweighs the good in humanity now, and I dont see how good could ever prevail anymore. Peace isnt profitable. I *love* myself, but I *hate* this world I'm supposed to find happiness in.

Bit of background

Weight gain. 

I had a traumatic experience in 2012 and I steadily started gaining weight

I have lost loads of weight and put it all back on plus more at least 3 times in the last 12 years.

I’m now at the heaviest I’ve ever been. I’m almost double the Weight I was in 2008

Death of Parents
My beloved father died from vaccine injury in 2021 and in her grief my mother has developed dementia and alzheimers 

This has really taken a toll on my mental health 

Despite this I held down a retail job until recently (august 2023), I left it because my graphic design business was really taking off and I was struggling with the physical side of retail work 

Since my life has become even more sedintary I hired a PT to come and work out with me 3 times a week at home

Relationship

I’ve been with my beloved partner for 16 years nearly but our intimate life hasn’t been existent for at least 6-7 years

I have tried to reignite it but he’s not interested. I know it’s because of my weight but he swears it’s not

Until recently I trusted him implicitly 

But in December I discovered he was arranging to meet other men for sex and in that instant my entire world collapsed. My trust in him has never recovered

He swears he’s never met anyone and just chatted with them. I believe him because I know him and I don’t think he had it in him to be unfaithful properly. And I’ve given him several opportunities to end out relationship but he says he loves me more than anything

Career

We, along with our best friend had a production company and for the last 8 years have been writing comedy and plays etc.

Since then we have filmed several comedy pilots pushing forward with projects  
We took a show to Edinburgh Fringe in 2022 with our female friend in a one woman show to critical acclaim  
When the Eurovision Song Contest came to Liverpool in 2023 we as locals pushed ourselves to get involved. Our closest female friend was already working for a high level broadcaster in the city and we wanted to use the character we took up to Edinburgh to push our work forward  
Between March and May we banged out 30 videos.  
Unfortunately our friend was experiencing instability in her work and so when it came to gaining access to some of the big Eurovision events she was pained to push anyone and ask. She also wouldn’t allow me to lead the charge on producing as she didn’t want me to Rock the boat. I was essentially castrated in the situation  
We had a big meeting with essentially the commissioner for the entire Eurovision show and left the other promises of huge involvement.  
What transpired was broken Promises, radio silence and I was left with no way of pushing forward on my own with it  
Surprisingly it all went well and we finished the videos and looked forward to Eurovision, no one fought, no one expressed uncertainty.  
After the hype died down and we tried to have another meeting and plan our next move. Our friend said she needed a break. We’d essentially all felt burned out after such a busy few months  
We agreed and planned to come back to it in September  
I had recently introduced her to her new spouse (I had known him since school and he was recently divorced)  
This man spent months buttering me up and getting close to me in an effort to get close to her.  
After they started seeing each other I essentially was dropped like a hot brick. Now I hardly ever hear from him even though he’s dating my best friend  
The relationship quickly exploded and it was pretty evident that they’re the love of each others lives.  
My friend spends all her free time with him and his children and after a recent promotion in work she is in the job she wants now  
My problem is I feel like I’ve properly lost her. We spent years building this company, dozens of ideas, working hard. And she’s now got her broadcasting job and it feels like she’s pulled the ladder up after her and left us to it  
We’ve gone from seeing her twice a week to 4 times in the last 6 months. Any free time she has is spent with him.  
We tried to come back in September but she was ready and didn’t want force it. Essentially saying we would come back to it ‘one day’  
The entire situation has left me depressed, I feel betrayed, sad and like I don’t know how to proceed with my own work.  
The worst part is I’m still friends with her. She has changed beyond recognition though. We hardly ever talk anymore on WhatsApp when we used to chat every day  
I don’t feel like I can tell her how I feel because she will feel like I’m trying to control things  

Existential crisis

As you can see

I’ve really been through the ringer in recent years

Despite this I’m still trying to push ahead with plans for my writing career with amazing opportunities being offered to me

Unfortunately I am exhausted. Physically, mentally. 

I’m almost in a daze most days, dissociative and distracted

I look at the state of the world politically, the threat of wars, pandemics, 

I hear horrendous stories about politicians, celebrities and satanic cults and suddenly now even my aethiest beliefs are now up in the air.

Everything I ever trusted about my own views on religion and life has been shaken 

Every single fundamental cornerstone of my stability is gone and I’m struggling to stay afloat 

I have no drive to push forward with career or weight loss because I honestly don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few years with wars etc. 

It all seems so pointless

⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️

I've been going downhill since Dec. I have good psychotherapy in place to start mid May but I'm genuinely scared that I won't make it until then. I've been trying to reach out to a small selection of loved ones for a couple of months and it feels like nobody is reaching back. 
I can't end my life. I have a 4yr old daughter and she loves me more than anything else in the world. Ending my life is ending hers and I could never do that to her, hence the desperate showing of vulnerability and reaching out.

I don't want emotional support from loved ones. I just want company to ride it through and bring me back into the real world. Spend the afternoon at the beach with me. Come run boring errands with me. Try a new bakery with me. Let me spend the afternoon in your company while I do some uni work and we don't say a word. Idc. 

I've reached out to multiple loved ones (purposely, I figured that asking multiple ppl = less unhealthy reliance one 1 person/bringing them down). I've specifically asked for things like this. I haven't told them why, but I've mentioned that I'm feeling a bit low and want to feel part of the world again. I don't want to tell them outright that I'm actively suicidal because I don't want ppl to spend time with me in fear that I'll kms if they don't, I want them to spend time with me because they like my company.

I've been persistent, but nobody is reaching back and I feel so unloved (even if thats not the case), which is only making it worse. I know people have lives, but when so many people are consistently busy it hurts.
One person in particular I felt so close to has slowly been decreasing the amount of time spent with me and leaving me on 'seen' for days without a simple ""had a busy day, will reply _____"" when they used to be consistent with that kind of thing. I've asked to talk about it, either a quick in person chat or a phone call, and they don't even bother finding 30m of their time for either. I just want to know why it feels like they're able to make time for everybody else except me. If they don't want to spend time with me, that's fine and I'll move on. But being left in limbo with all these questions is hurting so much, so I guess that's another thing just adding to it all.

I feel like I've condensed a lot of complicated things into one vague post, but I know the post will end up even longer if I don't haha.",1713081663.0,

I’ve tried making friends at school but i feel like an outcast as soon as I step in the school. I have grown to hate everyone and everything around me because i feel so left out and ignored. I don’t really have much going for me and i plan on killing myself when i turn 18 because im just so tired of being left out and avoided and treated like an outcast.

I thought I was just more depressed and unmotivated due to being very sick, but now that I’m not sick anymore, I don’t think that’s the case, but it’s hard to tell when life has been extremely stressful.

Either_Stranger1656,I didn’t realize just how bad depression actually is until this year.,3,1c3hur2,1,"I’ve (21F) always struggled with anxiety. I guess with that has come a few bouts of mild depressive episodes that last maybe a few weeks. They’ve also never been “bad” for more than a couple of days. I don’t know if it’s fair to call them depressive episodes. I don’t even know anymore at this point. Suddenly everything changed in December. I can’t pinpoint what happened. It started as a regular week of just kind of feeling sad. And now it’s mid-April and I can’t even get out of bed most days. I’m failing every class. I have absolutely no money.

ProtoJoe,Unhappy my whole life. Need to get my story off my chest.,22,1c32sr0,2,"I've been unhappy my whole life, childhood come straight up. My parents were never together, besides the one time they made me, I highly suspect my conception was not consensual, but that's a whole other story. I can safely say my parents didn't care for each other at all.
Most of my earliest memories were of me being passed back and forth between my parents and they in turn would pass me off to other family/friends to look after me. It wouldn't have been so bad if some of those people weren't so abusive. Getting hit when I did something bad is one thing, but getting beat for no reason or explanation was another. Then there was all the sexual stuff. Learning about and engaging in sexual acts so young has definitely affected how I perceive intimacy as an adult.

So I definitely grew up with an unshakable sense of being unwanted and unloved. Except I thought those negative feelings and emotions were normal and everyone felt that way.

It wasn't until around age 12 I started living full time with my dad for school and made friends of my own I learned not every one felt all these constant negative emotions.

My life goals around this time developed into three distinct points: 1 migrate to a better country. 2 have a significant other I could love and trust. 3 have a child and raise them in a safe and loving environment.

Into my late teens/early twenties I was in a long term relationship that I was convinced, without a doubt,it was going to last forever. We got engaged and I started attending university in another country with the eventual goal of migrating there. Unfortunately that relationship didn't work out and ended very badly and dramatically.

Around this time I truly fell into deep depression. I would have immediately killed myself if it weren't for my elderly ailing father. Instead I made up my mind to take care of him then kill myself after he died. That was the mentality I had for years that allowed me to be an apathetic, unmotivated stoner that didn't care about anything.

Eventually he did pass and I had my suicide attempt. It was a feeble attempt that obviously didn't work but it did shake me out of that mentality for awhile. By this time I basically smoked and drank away my savings/inheritance. 
Life carried on, I did eventually seek professional mental health help. Even with therapy and medication I couldn't fully get over the mentality of ""I'm eventually going to kill myself"". 

Then COVID hit, I lost my job, people close to me died. Depression came back in full force and got worse and worse. The initial isolation of lockdown along with depression caused a kind of social anxiety I've never had before. Over the past few years I've gone days to weeks without any social interaction.
I know the way I am now is not good or healthy. I know the things I'm supposed to do to get better; get a job, go back to therapy, start back medication , exercise, practice socialising. But I really don't care to be ""better"" anymore. Knowing that I can fall back into this mentality, what's even the point? I'm in my late 30s now and have no hope for the future.

,I Hate Myself,3,1c3h08g,1,"I honestly don’t even know what if this is the right place to say this but I just need to get it off my chest. I know I need help. I hate myself. I think about how much better it would be if I wasn’t here, If I didn’t have to keep trying to be happy everyday. No one in my life understands how it actually feels to have depression. Over two years ago I got ghosted by my best friend and I truly haven’t been the same since. I grew up with her so our friendship was about 15 years deep. I told her everything and apparently it was too much for her and she just randomly ghosted me after she moved to another state. I have replayed conversations we had before she ghosted me constantly trying to figure out where the hell I went wrong or why she would walk away from the friendship. I can’t get over it, I honestly can’t. I still miss her everyday and I hate myself for pushing away someone that important to me and the worst part is I don’t know what caused her to leave.

silkroadCEO,I don't even feel like a person anymore,1,1c3n07o,0,"I (f 23) am not really sure what's going on with me, but I'm assuming it's not unique. I'll do my best to explain. Recently I just feel like I've lost myself and can't find me no matter what I do. I hope that makes sense.

Basically, I've lost all my hobbies and interests. I'm not the passionate, creative, daring person I once was and it's freaking me out. I'm an artist but I have undergone so much transition in the past year (two big moves) that I haven't had time to delve into much art. The other day, I sat down to draw and paint for the first time ever and the whole experience was just so mentally, physically, and spiritually painful. Ever since then, I've gone down a spiral that currently has me wanting to jump out of my skin. 

I used to play guitar. I used to draw and paint. I used to dress so cool. I used to take selfies. I used to take photos daily just to document and remember passing moments in daily life. Now, all I can do is work and sleep. 

Not too long ago, I had to stop getting my ADHD medication filled because I can't afford the appointments required and even when I can, I am so tired I miss my alarm for the appointments. That's happened twice now.

For reference, I have undergone an insane amount of transition this past year. I moved with my partner from North Carolina, to Seattle. Well Seattle didn't work out for us the way we hoped (a job we had lined up a month ahead of time fell through literally the week we arrived), so we make the quick decision to move in to the mother-in-law suite of my grandparent's house in the absolute armpit of FLORIDA. Yeah. It's a lot. So naturally, that was an absolutely chaotic and soul-crushing turn of events. 

My partner is a pharmacy tech and I am a bartender. When we first got to Florida, we expected to just work for a few months to save up money and move back to Seattle. What we didn't realize is the economy here in Florida is absolutely horrible. My partner and I are now stuck here working like CRAZY just to keep our bills paid. We feel so stuck. I am a bartender right now and the money is horrible, and I work until 3:00am, get home, and can't fall asleep until 6:00am. 

And that's the biggest thing! All I do is sleep. I am so TIRED. I sleep 12-14 hours a day or I literally cannot function. On my days off, all I can do is lay in bed. Sometimes I have the energy to clean, but most days I feel GLUED to my bed. I am very uninterested and uninspired by this place and the culture here. There's nothing to do. Even if there was, I'm flat broke. I am so grateful that I had a place to go instead of being houseless in Seattle, do not get me wrong. But I don't feel like I'm living. I barely see the sun. I can't wake up. I hate every item of clothing I own. I feel so unattractive. In fact, I don't really have much concept of what I look like anymore. I'm surprised when I see myself in the mirror. Like I forget I look like that. I can't create any art, which is unheard of for me.  I hate pictures of myself. I can't remember the last time I had fun????  I don't know, I just feel so weird. I feel like an unwanted guest in my own body. I feel lazy and unproductive and so useless. 

Is this what dissociation feels like? Could my lack of ADHD meds be the cause of all of this or is it deeper??? I'm just at a loss really. I have no idea what to do. 

TL;DR: I underwent two cross-country moves, we're stuck here now, I had to stop taking my ADHD meds, all I can do is work and sleep because I'm so tired.  

I should also add that I have a very very supportive and loving partner. She does everything in the world she can for me. However, she does not struggle with ADHD or Acute Depression like I do, and I just need to hear from others that do. ",1713076589.0,
Prior-Influence-7188,Can you stop thinking?,2,1c3j8ra,0,"I'm tired, I'm just done at this point. I started talking to some and fucked it up within a month. I trusted them and told them what I was going through after the expressed concern for me. After a week of them knowing what was going on I was told that I was trying to guilt trip them. I only started to share because they caught me trying to ask questions about if I simply dissappear. They seemed to care and then ended up doing that. It hurts so much, I just don't want to feel anymore. 

Then there's the overthinking that got me to the point where they told me off in the first place. I couldn't shut my brain up and kept trying to tweak little bits of what I said so it became spam messaging. I want to stop thinking and feeling. It hurts to live but I have friends who would follow should I off myself. 

I know I'm not alone but I wish I was so I could just stop suffering. I'm only a couple weeks into being 18 and they have been nothing but pain. My meds haven't seemed to work so I want to know if there is a med strong enough to where I'm no longer conscious of the life I'm living. I don't want to die and hurt those around me but I'm also tired of suffering.

I guess this is more of a rant but if there are meds that could do that then I'd like to know. I just don't even know where to begin anymore. I tried just getting my life together but it seems to get destroyed within the week of me fixing a problem.

OOP, back to angry.. then the sadness of knowing im a failure comes after... and those switches scare me.. a lot.. i really hope that isn't what i think it is...

goldnugget1988,"Divorced, lost all assets, dad died, stuck in town I hate",10,1c34sck,3,"I don't even know where to start, just figured it might make me feel better if I said it out. In the past 6 months, I got blindsided with divorce. Found out she spent every dime I had paying off her debt, and she waited till I got promoted at work so she could get child support. I was skipping meals thinking we were broke. 

Lost the house i spent ten years saving for within a year, she left the house and refused to pay for anything but due to some legal stuff had to sell it anyways. I spent 15k and got back 150bucks.

Lost the truck, but still owe on it. She refuses to pay her half, I haven't been able to since she took just about everything so wasn't able to keep it

To top it off, my dad died during this time. Stage 4 cancer, I was their with my kids when he passed away. I can still see him.

Only thing holding me together is my new gf, we found each other after the divorce so no I didn't cheat. I'm a lot of things, but I'm no cheater. 

Plus works been awful and stressful, so many lay offs I'm surprised I'm still here. 

I feel like just running, going to a town I've always wanted to live in, it's peaceful their, but since one of my kids needs medical often I can't really leave without a huge fight with the ex. I'm struggling hard to keep my cool, and it finally came out last night where I got extremely mad at one of my kids. I never get that mad, like ever. I felt bad, I'm just so on edge lately.

Everyone I know took her side, and I don't even know the reason why she left. At this point I don't care, I'm better off, but it is lonely at times. 

I'm struggling, hard, but at least financially I'm independent. I know how much I have at all times, I can eat three times a day know. Days are getting better, at least I'd like to think so. 

Thanks for listening, it felt good to write it out then keep it bottled up

AccidentNo3657,advice,1,1c3ljau,2,"I’ve been struggling with depression from a very young age. I think my first suicidal thoughts started forming when I was around 10. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (1) when I was 20 (I’m now 22) and I feel like ever since my diagnosis I’ve gotten worse. I found out recently that I will not be able to afford to transfer to university, bc the music department requires a weird schedule while allows very little time for work on weekdays. This has made me spiral. I’ve been wanting to go to a “real school” since I graduated high school, and I really thought I was close. I’m having memory issues, I’m not enjoying any of my likes, I’m isolating myself from my boyfriend, and I’m having a lot of suicidal ideation. I don’t think I want to go yet, but I can’t seem to muster up the energy to live. I guess what I’m asking is if anybody who’s diagnosed with major depressionor  bipolar disorder could give me advice? Does it get better? What helped you snap out of a depressive episode? What helps you with depression? 

Note: I’m unmedicated right now (manic decision that I regret deeply), but I’ll be seeing a psychiatrist in two weeks to hopefully start on mood stabilizers (lithium is the only one I’ve had) and anxiety medication, and stick with it. ",1713071026.0,

yuzu_death,How do you cope with depression caused by events you have no control over?,1,1c3leqm,0,"For context I am 22 and feel like the past few years haven’t been very kind to me. My mom is terminally ill, I’ve been living in pretty bad living conditions (my landlord is a slumlord), I have money stress from being poor, and just found out I have cancer. I’m also gay in a homophobic environment and have a disability, which I used to be ok with, but has been wearing on me as I have started to lose some mobility I used to have and I can no longer do some of my major hobbies like playing music. 

 I honestly was doing okay (functional, able to work and socialize fine) until I found out about the cancer and since then my mental health took a nose dive. I don’t want this to sound like a pity party and I don’t pity myself, but honestly I think this is a lot to experience in just the past few years. I’ve tried to compensate by controlling the aspects of my life I can, but it’s so overwhelming.

 I’ve lost motivation to do anything because I don’t think it really matters. I feel like no matter hard I try, this external events will always come and sweep me off my feet. My girlfriend also left me soon after I was diagnosed because it was overwhelming for her and so I am feeling quite alone. I have no idea where to start because I want to be happy and content, but feel so hopeless. This hopeless feeling is compounded by the state of the world and society like climate change, the fact that I will probably live in poverty the rest of my life and so will a good portion of the world, etc. It’s pretty unlikely my cancer will kill me in its current state (I’ll just have a facial scarring or deformity maybe), so I want to be able to try and move past this feeling, but don’t know how. Is this even possible to get past?

 I don’t know if it’s worth pursuing therapy or depression for treatment because I think my situation is one where depression is probably the correct response to have. But I’d appreciate anyone’s input because I can’t find anyone else who understands this feelings.",1713070577.0,

Money-Only,What am I supposed to feel,1,1c3l78u,0,"Hi. Please do not worry, I am not in any danger. In fact, I need some advice.

I am a 22 year old male, and an immigrant student in this country. People say that I talk in a mechanized manner, and also think like one. I tend to lean heavily on my rational side, and try to decipher every problem, even a social and emotionally one into facts. You can say I like to view humans in general as some sort of a game. Naturally, I don’t react much.

Furthermore, experiences in childhood and school has given me trust issues with people. I do not even make a lot of friends, as I am quite introverted. You can say that I trust people to do certain things, but I don’t trust them in general. I have been cheated on, dumped on for another guy, been told I am a joke for a life, ugly, et cetera. I can count only ex girlfriend that has been ever nice to me.

One of the reasons I don’t go for relationships is because I am an immigrant. I never know when I’m going to move, where I’m going to move. I am in college, and I aspire to do a PhD in my subject, which means that I will move around. I love studying ung my subject, like a researcher. So I am not keen on relationships much, because it can mean long distance. I broke up with my last girlfriend (the nice one) because of this reason, as she was going to Canada and I to New Jersey.

I found out an hour ago that my bestfriend has slept with my ex ex girlfriend. This is also a really nice one, but we broke it off because of my issues with long distance. 

I have these rules: I don’t sleep with my friends’ ex; I don’t sleep with their girlfriends; I don’t sleep with their crushes; and I don’t sleep with their hookups. Even with me trying to rationalize everything, I believe we leave some part of ourselves with the person we sleep. Afterall, dopamine is released during sex, which happens only when you are happy. As a man (call me toxic if you will), I believe some possession is also there. But I don’t expect everyone to follow these rules.

I have realized he is my first best ever, as I have never felt like this before. I don’t know what to feel. Hurt because my best friend slept with my ex ex? Or hurt because my ex ex did this? Angry at myself because clearly there is no relationship and they are free to do what they want? Angry at myself for expecting hin to follow the rules that are meant for me?

Slimesuprise,Oyasumi Punpun,1,1c3l031,0,"I used to believe that depression was something you gradually overcome, and for many people, that's the case. However, I've been battling with it for a long time. I have tried reading many self-help books but I've started to believe they are a scam because they never work. One day, I decided to read a manga (stay with me, trust me!). After finishing the story and reflecting on it, my mindset completely shifted. I noticed unsettling similarities between myself and the protagonist, particularly the qualities that were sabotaging him. The manga covered the character's life from childhood to adulthood, showing how his mental state impacted his future. It was especially eye-opening to see how dwelling on the past led to his life falling apart. After finishing the manga, I made a firm decision never to let myself end up in such a position. I didn't want my condition to escalate to that level. Now, I can't guarantee anything, so take this with a grain of salt, but I've genuinely noticed a significant change in myself. I even waited out for 2 months just to make sure I didn't go back to being depressed, but im still happy with myself. That is subjective since happiness is a fleeting feeling, but I'm happier more often. And I'm also more comfortable with my unhappiness. The manga is called ""Goodnight Punpun"" or ""Oyasumi Punpun,"" and it's important to note that unlike regular comics, you read it from left to right. If you're considering reading it, be warned that it contains depressing elements that may worsen your mood. However, for me, it had the opposite effect. It also includes some... interesting... panels, so I recommend checking out content warnings online before diving in. I hope my experience helps someone else!

pants_haver,Just tired of trying ,1,1c3krgb,0,"I lost all my friends and connections last year. Playing in bands, doing shows at my house, having millions of “friends”. 

Someone made a post about me and ruined my life. I hold myself accountable for the actions that made people want to ruin me- and the parts of it that DID have truth. but for the most part it was not true. And it effectively destroyed everyone’s depiction of me. I’m trying to do everything in my power to identify and rid myself of character defects that led to this kind of turmoil. But I’m just not the person that people have turned against. It makes me cry a lot.

When the post happened- management from my favorite places reached out to me to ask me to not show up anymore. I wasn’t “banned” formally, but it was clear that I do not belong where I feel good anymore. So I moved cities, and moved in with my grandmother. I’ve just never felt so alone and weak and pathetic and childish. 

I spent my entire adolescence and younger life building up a career and lifestyle that was destroyed in an hour. Now I’m 29, completely alone and passionless. I’m a hard worker, and I do everything I can do bring myself out of it. Volunteering, going out, trying to date, starting bands, nothing will be the same. 

I’m in therapy, group therapy, I take care of my body and I try to my mind. I’m just so tired of trying. And so mad at myself for not standing up for myself when it mattered most. People say “time heals all wounds” but god damn. Nothing can prepare you for something like this. I’m inconsolable.

The worst part (besides losing my life over something that didn’t happen) is that I can’t even talk about it. Whenever I do, I essentially just scare them out of being my friend. Even when they do believe me.

 People say to me “you don’t have to bring it up”, but I feel so dishonest leaving it out. I have this giant pit in my stomach at all times. I have become a recluse because I’m just so closed up now- I’m not even the same person.

Now I feel as if I’ve lost that spark I used to have as a kid for such a long time that it’s driving me to the point where I think I might just end it all, I don’t see a point of living a life where I’m walking up wishing I didn’t. 
I don’t know how other people manage to live on such successful and good lives when I’m stuck, I feel like I’ve been stuck for years.
Everyday it’s hard to just exist, I miss the times of when I used to wake up, watch adventure time with toast my mum made me before school wishing I could watch more episodes before primary school, then going to school and actually looking forwards to going home and playing split screen games all day with my brother. 
Now what’s left of me ? Someone who abuses substances almost everyday to escape from my own reality. Sits in the room throughout the day rotting if I don’t have work because I don’t wanna go outside and non of my friends invite me to anything. Complains about every little thing even if it’s the smallest problem in the world, this eventually leads to anger then extreme depressive episodes, I’m tired of this now, I feel so disconnected from myself to the point where I cannot even recognise my own personality. 
I just don’t know what went wrong for me to feel like this and I don’t know how to stop this. I’ve tried therapy in secondary school but it was hard for me to open up because I would have so much anxiety I would sweat, shake, and stutter my words so much, it made me so uncomfortable it put me off so I stopped, after finishing school I started smoking which made me feel more relaxed and I thought it was helping me, at first it was a one off thing doing every once a week or two, now I’m doing it everyday and I can’t stop, I’m now in the trap of trying other substances and getting easily hooked on them.
