They’ve been married for 25 years ! 
My husbands mom has been married for 15 years and her relationship with his dad(stepdad) is so beautiful when I first met them I found it weird like ?? Yall don’t  yell at each other?yall don’t fight ? I was so confused they never fought infront of the kids and it’s like ????? And I used to think that was normal fighting in front of the children because that’s how I was raised …
My husband is so laid back and calm and I feel like I’m so crazy sometimes when it come to us arguing and I think that’s partly because of the way we was raised the way we saw your parents and their relationship

GermanWineLover,No one to share my success with,69,1c68pve,27,"I'm a PhD student (philosophy) and yesterday, I reveived the mail that my paper was accepted by a journal that is for my field of research pretty important. I was stressed out about this for months so I was really happy that I made it.

A day before I had an argument with my father (my mother died in 2020) and we haven't spoken a lot since then. I forwarded the mail to him - no reaction, even though he knows how much it stresses me out. I know my mother would have been proud but he gives a shit.

taleasoldastime96,"Everything is working out exactly the way we want it to, and it’s a direct result of how amazing my husband is. He just doesn’t seem to see it. ",28,1c6e1pa,11,"I just need to brag about my husband for a little bit. 

My husband has always been an incredibly hard worker. He’s reliable, efficient, easy to work with, basically a boss’ dream. Unfortunately, the higher ups at his current job don’t seem to see or value that. Anyone who works with him directly will sing his praises. But the owner of the company seems to be a little hot and cold on all his managers and supervisors. He fires them for no reason. He doesn’t pay them fairly. It’s not really the place we thought it would be when he started and it’s becoming increasingly apparent that he can’t (or doesn’t want to) move up any further in this company. 

This poses a little bit of an issue, because we’re planning to start having kids soon, and I would really like to be a stay at home mom. He wants to make it happen too, but it really isn’t going to work out with his current salary. 

Because he’s such a hard worker and all his coworkers love him, a coworker that recently left the company recommended my husband for a job at his new company. Based on the coworker’s rave reviews and my husband’s extensive experience with everything they need, they hired him on the spot. It’s a manager position at a new branch of a national company. They’re literally letting him build the whole operation the way he wants to. They’re paying him more than twice what he was making before, with better benefits, retirement, and hours than he had before. 

This is exactly the kind of job he deserves. It’s work that he enjoys much more than what he was doing before. It’s a salary that will pay for our family. It lets me stay home with my kids, just like I’ve always wanted to, like my mom was able to do for me. It’s absolutely perfect and it’s a direct result of the kind of hard work that my husband has been putting in for years. And I really think it’s going to pay off here. 

He puts on a brave face. He doesn’t want to appear insecure, at least not to everyone else. But he’s worried that he won’t be what they want. He’s never had any complaints at any of his jobs about his work ethic or his productivity, and this is definitely the job that has been the most in his wheelhouse. I see no reason to believe that he won’t kill it, but I just can’t get him to see it. 

I’ve been telling him all week how proud I am of him, and he’s still worried. He wants so badly to provide for our future family and for me, and he’s finally found a way to do it, exactly how we all want. How do I convince him that he’s doing a fantastic job?",1713370730.0,
RedShardsX,Is the world really that bad?,42,1c69pm2,104,"If you're active on other parts of Reddit, you get used to people lamenting about how the world sucks and everyone's lives are going down.

I really want to hear it from ""the friendlier side"" of Reddit. The world isn't perfect, but overall, are we going up or down? Today feels like a day that our ancestors would kill to exist in. We've got so much cool stuff that we didn't have before.

Silly_Tap_8264,My Roommate Hasn't Peed in 20 Hours!,175,1c615px,138,"I woke up over 19 hours ago and saw that my roommate had been in the bathroom 30 minutes or so before I woke up. I think he went to sleep at that time and just woke up a few hours ago.

HE STILL HAS NOT USED THE BATHROOM IN THE LAST 20 HOURS! NOT EVEN ONCE! Is he an alien? Or wtf is happening? Is this even possible for a human body?

By the way, just some background: he's a gaming addict. He doesn't have a job, doesn't really try getting one, spends his whole day in his room playing online games, and usually even plays in the bathroom when he needs to use it (sometimes while I'm cursing him outside :) )

**Edit**: A significant portion of the comments is saying how creepy I am for monitoring his peeing schedule. Retrospectively, it does look creepy if someone doesn't understand that my room's door and the bathroom door are literally 5 cm apart. I was simply working all day in my room and noticed that he didn't use the bathroom... So no, I'm not actively monitoring him 😅",1713329058.0,

Broad-Cranberry-9050,What's the consensus on people who post pretending to be travelling when they arent?,8,1c6eh7z,18,"My cousin (F30) went on her first euro-trip to spain and rome. Im not sure the days she was there but from what I heard she was there for about a week and has returned home. The way I foud out was that she was visiting our other cousin (F26) and F26 told me that she had left like 3 days prior. I had thought she was still travelling because everyday she was making posts and stories about different locations in spain.  


For example, when she was in spain she hitup 5 locations and 2 fancy restaurants in one day. She has been spreading out those stories to make it seem like she did the 5 locations on a seperate day each and she went to those restaurants on seperate days.  


According to her story she ""just arrived"" in rome, even though she has been back home for like a week.

I know it's her business how she posts but it also reminded me of how SM has influenced people to think their lives have to be amazing everyday. Or at least have others think it is. It was kind of like the coachella thing a few yers bck where influencers faked pictures to make it seem they were at coachella when really the pic was taken across the globe.

So today I got my test results back and
Wow. I BOMBED.

I failed by a huge margin and I knew I was going to fail the moment I walked out of the exam. I've been a straight C and B student the whole time in school.

It's not the end of the world. I'm still in my (late) 20s and fairly young. I'm picking myself up and starting over. Next exam is in January.

I just feel numb and tired. Not sad. I totally deserved that. 

I don't feel like law is the way for me. Maybe I'm too stupid. Or too lazy. But I've sunk 3 years into this. But if I run now, I'll only feel like I ran away from my problems. And I don't even have other job qualifications. 

I'm rambling now, just having a hard time accepting I've done so horribly.

While_Evening,What is the “cheeseburger and fries” for your culture? ,251,1c5pyzh,414,"In my parts of the United States the cheeseburger and fries order has been ubiquitous. 

It’s the “I’ll just have a _______” of eating outside the home.

There are standard ingredients, but most people have distinct preferences. 

It can be used to measure inflation because it’s been around so long and everyone eats it. 

It’s a cultural staple.

If a group can’t agree what to eat, this is the fall-back. 

Companies and restaurants have distinct ways of doing it. 

It’s not necessarily better when it’s homemade. 

Maybe there is a fast food chain, or a whole fast food category, for it.

alexander_924,I feel like my father is forcing/pressuring me into running the family business,3,1c6d3go,5,"It’s a small residential construction company. It’s obviously in HIS best interest that his son takes over his company so he obviously wants it to happen and he has said it as well. 

The only issue I have is he has never said anything like, ‘If you start doing the job and you don’t like it you can quit if you think it’s best’ or ‘I’d like you to takeover the business in the future but if you’re not interested in that then that’s fine’ 

He’s only ever talked about it being good if I did, he has never said I don’t need to. He basically has only shown me the road of running the business, and hasn’t shown me the road of not doing so. Which I think is unfair and a little selfish. It’s good that I get an insight into how the business is run and I’m grateful that I get to be part of the business with job security and all that don’t get me wrong. I just think it is a tiny bit selfish for him to try and push his own ideas instead of considering my own. 

At the end of the day I’m not saying I won’t one day run it but it’s not something I’m remotely interested in as a 21 year old with various various other commitments and hobbies outside of work.

I didn't react to this one at all. Upside down turtles? Okay, I just don't get how this is supposed to be funny. If I recall correctly, a upside-down turtle is actually in peril. 


https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1c5ucos/haircutting_guide_from_the_70s/


Yes, I spotted the klingon in the picture. I imagine there's a few more in there. I just found it lame and boring. They also had color photography in the 70s. Making it black and white just made it more dull.

Like, ""I totally have a shot with her!"" and gives me something to look forward to. I still get ""rejected"" by ones outside my budget, but otherwise, there are still some that I ""match"" with. 

On the other hand, dating apps are just a blackhole, and the worst kind of it. Every swipe and comment ends up being ignored and is just a huge waste of time AND highly demoralizing. 

At least with escorts, you can work towards something, make progress, and achieve it. It gives such a more hopeful and motivating outlook on life. Instead of the doom and gloom of dating apps. 

For all you that do well on the apps, congrats. For those who don't do well, there are still fun intimacy times to be had in life - don't give up hope! Make moh moneyyyyy",1713373367.0,

The reason I did ask her is because I was under the impression that she doesn't care, but she said that could not be anymore untrue. What does everyone feel about follow up questions?

aetherpurple,The Working Affair,1,1c69bv5,0,"The first thing to mention is just basics of who I am. I guess above all, I'm just an ambitious guy who likes to make the most of life. But truly - my life story is strange. 

It would be fair to say I've been among the least and most privileged people to exist.

Journey to the wonderland of high school: 36 ACT + 800 Math ii Level 2 June 2015. 162/165 cognidna IQ. Extraordinarily proud of creativity and overall capacity exhibited on good days. Would have time of my life detailing ideas. Was looking forward to Vanderbilt. Also eyeing AMD as a long term investment.

Guess what I got in July? A journey. 

Parents insisted I attend a Boy Scout Eagle wherein old paint to be removed. Turns it out it was leaded. Arrived late, mask given late. Eventually provided mask would allow lead chips to enter through top and into mouth. I hadn't eaten much - so the poisoning process was especially brutal. 

It's just one of those things a teenager has trouble stomaching. Could I really be losing - anything brain faculty - to this fluke event? What if I'm never going to be myself again? This controlled my mind for weeks until eventually denial composited with grieving acceptance set in.

As lethargy and lead colic registered, it became pretty obvious life was never going to be the same.

Somehow, I developed PTSD & memory loss, plus progressive cognitive impairments across domains. Perhaps above all, my innocence and self-assured confidence disappeared. 

For the longest time, the picture wasn't pretty. Not much pleasure to life, and severe depression. 

Unchelated acute lead poisoning has the capacity to entirely ravage a brain while simultaneously leaving ambition and desire for self-realization intact. Probably one of the worst epigenetic modulations imaginable. 

In addressing what lead does to a teenage brain - it's more a matter of what it doesn't sabotage. Apoptosis, necrosis, neuronal death, demyelination, axonopathy, synaptic disturbance, brain system dysregulation, neurodevelopment disheveling.

I can demonstrate the effect in 2 pictures, about 2.5 months apart.

https://imgur.com/a/ISFEZyz

The first 2 months of senior year, my math average was an F. Over time, I’d relinquish short term, working memory, episodic memory, and time-contextualized memory. Also slurred speech and major reading difficulty.

And yet, through the adversity, I found a way to claw my way back. Strangely, my passion and maybe talent for chemistry and neuroscience enabled one of the weirded, toughest, and bitterly rewarding journeys imaginable. 

Ultimately, I reconnected with the person I thought I could have been through relishing in science again. Reading papers, formulating advanced nootropic delivery, and programming utilities to assist in the process. Also meticulously managing pharmacokinetic abstractions toward brain resolution. 

In the end, perhaps I could share some words I'm proud to have put together:

Optimal_Test3280,Official friendship breakup,1,1c69575,4,"This is a rant post & also asking for help. Appreciate those who take their time to read it.

This story is quite long, but i’ll try to sum it up as much as possible. Back in 2021, I (21 M) started talking to a girl (19) via twitter, then on IG. She was from my hometown as well and apparently we had friends in common, I just didn’t know it.

Over the months, I started catching feelings for her. She never did. She never was 100% sincere about it, and I never stopped the snowball rolling down when I should had. The process of me assuming she didn’t like me was extremely slow, which might sound better than a shocking reality, but in this case I don’t think it is: it went from “you know I’m starting to see a girl right now”, to “who knows, maybe in the future”, to “we would never know what would’ve happened if I hadn’t met this girl”, to “I don’t think I would have felt feelings for you either way”.

I decided to keep her as a friend, an exception I wouldn’t usually make, but I loved her either way and that’s how our relationship had started, as a friendship since the beginning. But I never truly got over it. Every time she mentioned that girl, or any other girl, or guy, I had this punching feeling in my stomach. We just couldn’t talk about her romantic relations, I was unable to keep up with it.

The friendship since then was ups and downs. For months I felt like everything was okay, then it worsened one week because one argument, then we had 6 months of a healthy friendship, then it stopped again… until this week.

We weren’t already talking much since January, but this week we started to talk again, and today she said it was because she wanted to let me know that it should be over, for good. That changes in her life were coming, at uni, meeting new friends, leaving things that tormented her. She said she didn’t want to put up anymore with any arguments, with being unable to speak with me about certain topics and having to measure every word she said, with several bad comments I had made (which is true, I’ve made a lot of mistakes and I can’t deny that). And she said I was probably done too, with trying to overcome the impossible…

And, what now? Should I really give it up, for good? My mom always told me, if you ever take a definitive decision, please don’t look back. Should I take the step and never look back? No more “I need a break”, but actually end our friendship?

It’s coming up to a big anniversary since the end of high school for me. Lately, I’ve really been feeling like I should arrange a reunion with all of the people I used to be close friends with. 

The only issue is… almost all of the people I haven’t spoken to in many, many years.

Has anyone been in this kind of situation? What’s the best way to do this? Do you think I should create a Facebook group with everyone added in to it or message everyone individually?

world_citizen7,"The critical (but often ignored) skill of ""reading the room""",13,1c5lgve,5,"Reading the room is the skill of perceiving and understanding the unspoken dynamics in a social setting or gathering. When you can “read the room,” you pick up on subtle cues, both verbal and nonverbal, from the people around you. These cues might include body language, facial expressions, mood/vibe, and context clues. By paying close attention to these signals, you can adjust your behavior accordingly, which helps increase engagement and create rapport with others.  
  
Sometimes this skill is just a matter of paying attention. Of course context matters, is it a formal meeting, a social gathering, or a casual chat? Also, take time to reflect on past interactions and consider what cues you may have missed or misinterpreted. Reflective practice can help refine your ability to read a room over time. Also, learn from others. Observe individuals who are skilled at reading a room and learn from their techniques and strategies. Pay attention to how they navigate social situations.  
  
And remember, reading the room is a skill that develops over time - so just like any other skill keep practicing! It's a valuable skill in social situations and professional settings.

Logan_its_mE,How can I live in the moment?,2,1c5tm1h,4,"Hi redditors, please need some guidance so I can better myself and enjoy life.
For past couple of years I've been seeing it in myself that I can't enjoy places, people, event or anything. I feel like a grumpy old man who doesn't want to experience new things even though I'm just 25. 

For instance, I like things the way they are. I don't try new stuff. I don't like to make new friends and I stick to the old ones.

The most sad part about myself, which I feel, is that I can't live in the moment. Whenever I try to go out with friends, party with new people, travelling, etc. Events which are supposed to add values and experiences to my life, I try to skip them so I can be home, alone. I like to be alone but that's not true. I have good amount of friends, have a really wonderful girlfriend but I just like to be alone in my room, or play games, study or just ve creative but alone. I don't have any other socials except reddit that would sway my mind away whenever I'm say exploring or traveling, so I don't know what's wrong about me.
A new change to my life which I'd like to add was I came to a different country for my masters. 
I don't want to be like this. I do feel things and I want to feel things when I remember them, thinking them back, laugh and cry over them. I want to feel. Please help. ",1713307120.0,

Naturally, I assumed I just wasn’t drinking enough, but I never really experimented with that until recently.

I’m a college student and I know a lot of college students live off caffeine, so I thought maybe I could use it to give me the strength to get through the day.

I can do a few of these things, I’ve diagnosed and fixed a ton of problems with my cars over the years. 

Anyway I got her some premium headlights, fuses to fix the various non working parts and installed them. However when I turned the car on it did not want to run right AT ALL. It was just puttering down the road, took forever to get up to speed. All I did was unhook the battery to get to one of the headlights.

Well, I drove the shit out of it and got it running almost as good as before I messed it up. But I wasn’t satisfied. 

I knew that it was either getting too much or not enough oxygen, and I remember the check engine light being related to oxygen, so I went and ran the codes again. The previous time we ran the code it was running fine so we didn’t mess with it, basically could have been anything from the oxygen sensors to a clogged catalytic converter.

Well, I changed the mass air flow sensor and now her car is running better than ever, her headlights work great, the stereo works now, and she can use her high beams again. Even the dome light in the car works.

No one shot down the obligatory white dove of peace for their dinner so I guess the ceremony was considered a success. This followed by shots of videographers videoing a guy running with the torch in one hand and an olive branch in the other. He is no Forrest Gump.

Wouldn't you like for once A single person to just get up and say ""Let's light this puppy"" take out a match and light the torch up? You know all those invited attendees are siting there thinking: ""I'm sweating my ass off when will this be over"" or ""is there going to be free booze with lunch I sure as hell want to down a couple of Margaritas after this shit!""

VillainOfKvatch1,My TV consumption recently has been next-level!,1,1c5iujh,21,"I'm a guy who likes to sit with my wife and watch an episode or two of a good TV show after work. But you know how it is - sometimes TV can be hit or miss. Sometimes a show is just okay. Sometimes you like a show but your spouse doesn't, or vise-versa. Sometimes it starts good and falls apart. Sometimes you're excited to start a show and then you get disappointed. 

In the past month or two, I've watched 4 shows that have been EXCELLENT. It's been one banger after another. I've never had a run of excellent TV like this. 

It started with 3 Body Problem. No spoilers, but I went into that show optimistic and I was blown away. It's not often a show presents an idea that I've never seen before. The best thing a show can do is show me something new and this show did it. I can't wait for season 2. 

Then, we picked up The Gentlemen. What can I say about Guy Ritchie? The man knows how to entertain. I like everything he does, and this didn't disappoint. Funny, suspenseful, tense. All around solid show. 

Then, Fallout. I was nervous about this one because I've been a fan of the games since I was a kid. Video game adaptations are notorious for being bad (looking at you, Witcher), and Amazon is notorious for not respecting the source material (looking at you, Rings of Power). But I was stunned by how good Fallout was. The story, the acting, the world-building, the aesthetic, the music - they nailed it. I don't know if I've ever seen an adaptation that was so faithful to the source, so respectful of the fanbase and the material they love. It was great. 

Now, I'm on Shogun. I mean damn! The attention to detail, the world-building, the acting! This show is as immersive as anything I've ever seen. It's gorgeously shot. The palace intrigue, the different factions, the themes - I don't know if there's a word for whatever is above epic, but this is it. 

 Best of all, my wife has LOVED every single one of these shows as much as I have. She's already declared 3 Body Problem her favorite show of all time, she was rolling on the floor laughing at ""I'M A CHICKEN!"" And she wants me to install Fallout 76 on her computer and do some wasteland exploration with me.

I’ve tried texting her on iMessage and Snapchat and Instagram and yet to recieve a response because it’s on delivered still like “morning” “hope everything’s okay with you” etc. She has yet to still see it.

I started with some basic herbs in pots on my balcony, thinking I'd kill them off in a week (I'm notorious for my black thumb), but somehow they're thriving! Seriously, watching those little green sprouts pop up was like witnessing magic. And the smell? Oh man, there's nothing like the scent of fresh basil wafting through your kitchen.  
  
But here's the kicker: the satisfaction. I mean, who knew that nurturing something as simple as a plant could bring so much joy? Every morning, I'm out there, checking on my little green babies, and every new leaf or bud feels like a personal victory.

I was going to a movie this weekend with my mom, and I looked out the car window and was hit with this overwhelming feeling of just how weird our existence is.. 

We’re on a spinning ball, in the middle of a galaxy, and somehow out of all of the billions of possible spinning balls in the Milky Way, our ball is the only one that we know of that has managed to develop life, including a highly intelligent species capable of creating advanced technologies. 

And then I start to wonder if it’s all an incredible stroke of luck or if there really is more to our existence that we just don’t know about. And the fact that we can contemplate that as humans is amazing, a little bug is only thinking about food, shelter and finding a mate, they don’t think about any of this stuff. 

And then I wonder what was “before” the Big Bang and that’s when everything starts to spiral. I know that nobody really knows, and that bothers me even more.

Putrid_Excitement_63,Why do I switch the way I speak based on who I am talking to?!?,40,1c4psx8,36,"Ok here goes, 

When speaking to non-native English speakers, I will use words and sentence structure that mirror how they speak. I do this knowing they would have understood me perfectly had I spoken normally. 

Similarly if I am speaking to a friend who uses certain slangs in their vocabulary, I too would use those slangs when speaking to them and then use other slangs with other friends and so on. 

My concern is this, does this mean I don’t have a solid sense of self, or that I am such a people pleaser let who craves acceptance and “chameleons” my self to make others feel comfortable.

My parents are South Asian immigrants who basically sacrificed their entire adult lives to me and my brother, living frugally and opting to save, not spending any money unless it was for their children's benefit. I have no clue what they actually like to do in their free time other than rest. I have bought them numerous gifts over the years that end up sitting in a cupboard unused. I would like to get them something that they would actually find value in but I have no idea what this can be.

They drink a lot of tea, so for one mother's day I got my mom a pretty tea cup. She does not use it because she ""does not want it to get ruined."" Okay, I guess I understand where she's coming from. When I went to Japan on vacation, one of the gifts I got for her was a specially designed rice scooper since we eat a lot of rice. I'm not sure if it gets used but when I visit (monthly or so) I never see it.

I got my dad a decorative ornament that he doesn't display. A pair of socks he doesn't wear.

Ok_Shower9143,"Quiero desahogarme, me estoy enfermando. ",5,1c4zr9i,10,"Termine con mi pareja hace un mes, fue culpa mía, tal vez no todo. 
Estuvimos juntos por casi dos años, el primer año fue hermoso, el es de estados unidos.
Cuando lo conocí, fue perfecto, me trató como una Reyna! 
Fue respetuoso, caballero, cariñoso, atentó todo! 
En ese primer año, el llamaba todos los días por videollamada, yo trabajaba por las tardes, así que el llamaba durante el día y a veces por las tardes, a veces hablábamos durante dos o tres horas sin importar que estuviera en mi trabajo, yo vivía sola y casi no podía ver a mi hijo, entonces enferme, y decidí volver a casa de mi madre, cuando volví el comienzo de ese año fue bien, pero despues el comenzó a tener mucho trabajo y bueno yo exigía atención tiempo, al cual pues me acostumbré, bueno entendi que su trabajo era muy serio y que yo eataba exagerando, pero no se que pasó, los mensajes y las llamadas fueron reduciendo, hasta llegar al punto de solo enviar ""buenos dias y buenas noches"" y las llamadas solo hablabamos cuado el me llamaba y se redujo el tiempo a tan solo 5 o 10 minutos.... Cuando estoy comenzó yo le dije que sentía... Se lo dije muchas veces.... ""Te necesito, necesito atención"" el dijo que si yo quería un novio 24/7 el no podía serlo por su trabajo y las otras cosas que debía hacer en casa con sus hijos.... Ok... Entendí de nuevo.... Pero yo sentía algo.... Algo extraño.... Ya estábamos muy alejados y no me refiero a la distancia de país.... Había algo más... Un día cuando el llamó yo estaba llorando, y volví a decirle que lo necesitaba, que había algo y que me estaba doliendo mucho.... Solo dijo ""iré pronto"".... Después de eso... Cometí el error de descargar de nuevo la aplicación donde el y yo nos conocimos. Abrí un perfil, si, buscándolo, solo dure una semana con el perfil y borre la aplicación, la mayoría de los hombres ahí solo son molestos... Bien, borre la app pero no borre el perfil.... Una semana antes de terminar, volvió a hacer lo que siempre hacía... Sabía cómo hacerme feliz, estaba trabajando y durante esa semana me llamo CADA DIA!!! mi corazón sintió alegría y esperanza... Cuando llegó el final del trabajo, y llegó a casa.... Se enfermo justo esa noche que llegó a su casa, y al día siguiente dijo que su hermana tendría una cirugía de cáncer de seno... Comenzaron de nuevo los problemas, eso significaba que no podía llamarle, a menos que el me llamará. Bien, ese día operaron a su ""hermana"" y ese mismo día le dieron el alta!!! El podría llevársela a casa para cuidarla... Ese mismo día en la noche me envió un mensaje diciendo que el siguiente día su hijo tenía cirugía en la rodilla,  y efectivamente lo tenía, de el si me envió foto en con la bata y el gorro donde se ve que estaba preparándolo. Extrañamente de su hermana no hubo foto. 
Honestamente, la distancia era tanta, los pretextos eran tantos, la ausencia era tanta... Que mis ganas de seguir ahí intentando tener más atención... Se fueron.... Después de eso me envió mensajes pero ya no tenía ganas de responder.... El intimo día el me envió una foto donde decía que estaba cenando con sus hijos y me mostró fotos de sus hijos y.... En una foto se alcanzó a ver un codo... Y en otra un dedo delgado parecía de mujer .... Entonces yo le envié un mensaje diciendo.... Wow! Tu hermana fue con ustedes espero que lla este mejor! Y no respondió a eso... Decidí decirle que ya no podía más que al parecer yo ya no tenía espacio ni era una de sus prioridades.... Que quería terminar.... Después el me envió un mensaje con una captura de pantalla donde vio mi perfil y dijo ""después de ver esto no pude confiar en ti! Te ame tanto que no podía dejarte ir, pero ahora que tú lo haces tengo el valor, yo merezco alguien fiel, y descuida no diré que solo buscas sexo!!!"" 
Después de 2 años de estar con el, y después de rogarle por atención.... De verdad solo fue culpa mía? 
Acepto mi error... Y no me justificare, solo quería atención pero no podía hablar con nadie ahí en ese sitio porqué simplemente no quería, por eso eliminé la aplicación. Pero.... Si el vio mi perfil ahí, significa que el también estaba ahí... Haciendo que?... 
Después de terminar hace unos días vio mi perfil de tiktok y vio mis videos de mis fotos, si tal vez son... Provocadoras pero gusta como me veo y quise hacer los videos y no se ve más que mis piernas... Pero porqué después de terminar reviso mi tik tok y envío un mensaje diciendo ""buena suerte"" 
Sigo rogándole por una oportunidad para hablar y arreglar las cosas, acepte mi culpa pero no fui infiel en ningún momento, justo ahora estoy luchando por no buscarlo por no rogarle, se que no quiere saber de mi... Y me duele, me duele hasta el alma, y no se cómo hacer que salga de mi corazón y mi mente... 
Le eh rogado mucho para hablar, el decía que me amaba demasiado y si, me equivoqué, pero no fui infiel o eso pienso yo, tal vez si tiene razón eso fue como una infidelidad no lo sé, pero acepto mi error, solo deseo que arreglarlas las cosas se que es difícil ya que el está en Estados Unidos y yo en México. 
Quisiera que me perdonara y que empezemos de nuevo, eliminé los videos que le molestaron. Le llamo y ya no se que más hacer.... Aunque... Se que el no quiere saber de mi eso es claro... Quisiera encontrar la forma de olvidarlo, pero el sigue pendiente de mi hijo, mi hijo lo vio como su padre y aún le llama así, le envía dinero para su corte de pelo, zapatos y lo que necesita y a mi madre le envía saludos y le dice que aún la quiere... Pero a mí no me responde....

Often-Inebreated,I've recently been thinking about writing a book. Its a very intimidating thought.,5,1c4wjey,5,"I *really* enjoy responding to people comments on reddit, After getting sober it has been kind of a hobby of mine. I used to exclusively reddit drunk, ^(I was drunk when I made my account, can you guess why I know this? haha) 

After my mind cleared up I came back to reddit and discovered that I could write much clearer and stay on topic better. It has become a form of therapy for me, trying to really put my thoughts down as clearly as possible. I also feel that I have had experiences that caused me to gain insight that others might not see as clearly. 

I don't want to come across as a braggard narcissist, but IRL I've genuinely helped at least a couple people create a better perspective on things and how to think about problems. 

Its not that my ideas are new or special or potentially even helpful, but I am able to express difficult concepts like the pursuit of happiness or societal expectations into ways that can be grasped without loosing the plot.  

An idea I *cannot* get out of my head is how important it is to not be lazy with your inner monologue and how its important to try and direct your emotional and mental energy towards things that aren't dead ends.   

I mainly just want to do this for me, as a way of really organizing my relationship with life in a way that I could go over my philosophy and see what parts are bullshit or could be improved. Expand or expire. 

Because everybody's life is different and there are no shortcuts, I wouldn't be coming from a place of enlightenment or any sort of pretense. My goal would be to have a book of essays and other short form passages that people could read and chew on, with the hope that they could expand on it themselves or push them towards a better outcome during life's many complex decisions and interactions. 

what are your ideas about this? Tell me its stupid if you want, but tell me why!  

What about ideas of things I could try to unpack? What are some topics that are overlooked or that are overstated?

And let me tell you, the feeling of wearing something you've made with your own two hands is unmatched.  
  
But here's the best part: the community. I never knew there were so many fellow knitters out there! I joined a local knitting group and we meet up once a week to knit, chat, and, of course, gossip. It's like having a built-in support system of people who totally get my newfound obsession.

AvailableSlide7561,Help On Choosing a YT Channel Name? How do I Know Which is Right For Me?,2,1c50gek,5,"Hello all. Im in need of a second opinion on my Youtube Channel name. I created a YouTube Channel a while back and decided to start posting more and more consistently. However a small part of me is wishing to rebrand and Im thinking of changing my channel name (also my Instagram and TikTok Tok name). Im just wondering how these channel names sound to someone else, what vibe do they give off etc. This is all pure curiosity. My channel is going to be essentially visual diaries, travel vlogs (I plan to live in Japan in the next couple years), lifestyle vlogs, me talking intimately about stuff that Ive learned and my perspective on the world (also will probably be talking about art, books, new recipes and manga because I love that stuff). My channel is really inspired by Leahsfieldnotes, Maddie Dragsbaek, Jenny Bourn, Rachel Nguyen, The Purple Palace, Hitomi Mochizuki and Emma Chamberlain.  
My first name is Maegan by the way  
Maegan Opus: my current channel name. I like the use and meaning of the word opus. I also think the addition of the word Opus adds a slightly serious vibe that meshes with my personality

  
Maegan Niccolo: My middle name is Nicole and I believe this is the male version of that name. I like they way this spelling looks with my first name. I also like the idea of my channel being named after me and it sounding like an actual first and last name. I sometimes worry it sounds too Italian and I am not Italian. This could be a non issue though.

I was at this cheap local bar with my friends when  an absolutely stunning girl with her boyfriend asks if they can join our table since the bar was packed. 

They're both awesome people. The girl had this nerdy passion for almost anything it seemed, which might be the single most attractive quality I can think of. We had so many overlapping hobbies and interests, even very rare ones. Even my nerdiest qualities were apparently big lifelong interests!

I honestly could barely believe how amazing she was as a person. Just everything seemed so... right. Like I found someone who really understood me, and who I really understood back, almost immediately. 

We talked all night, bonding over our shared and non-shared passions alike. Finally, we traded some song recommendations. I asked her to let me know how she liked the band later, which of course meant she needed my number.

We've been talking for like a week now over texts, pretty much all the time. Just today she mentioned her boyfriend again by name. I'm terrible with names, so I asked if that was the guy she was on a date with when we met. 

- ""oh, I'm not dating anyone!""

As maladaptively parasocial as it is, it was also comforting to know I had ""access"" to someone who's thoughts and experiences matched mine. It felt so effortless.

As much as I enjoy my actual real life it has always felt way less real and meaningful that whatever I found myself getting into whenever I'd go online. I was lucky to grow up when the internet hadn't fully been commercialized yet so it was a liberating experience to always have forums and creators available that matched my comfort zone better than whichever social circle Id find myself trapped in, having to put on fake appearances and pretend I was someone else just to not be a pariah.

Well, whenever any of those videos get taken down it just brings me back to reality on how ""not real"" it all was. It kinda forces me into having to come to terms with how pointless it all was, escapism basically, and that I remain trapped in a society that to this day consistently leaves me woefully unimpressed.

Regardless, it seems fitting that I'd ask in a faceless forum of all places if anybody here related to this.

Advice welcome I guess though I'll probably ignore it. As I said, I don't dislike my life. It's just so fake that participating in it gets tiring, hence why I always find myself running back to my comfort videos and forum threads to recharge (hence the whole point of why it's depressing when they stop being there where I'd expect them to).",1713130241.0,

He always came home for dinner so when he didn’t come to the back door at night I was so worried. He went missing and I tried to stay calm I ignored it and went for girls weekend away and left my partner at home. I get home today freaking out because he’s still not home. I print out flyers, walk around the block putting them in every single fucking letterbox and a couple of street polls. I planned to do more the next day. I came home crying and exhausted, after having a huge fight with my friend after her saying he was most likely dead and gone and “that’s just what cats do”. I’m laying in bed posting photos of him everywhere at 1am and I get up to go have a smoke and I hear a meow! I double checked to make sure it wasn’t our kitten and sure enough my cat was home. I was sooooo happy. He was super hungry and thirsty and gave me lots of cuddles. Now it’s got me thinking…. 
1. Has someone seen the flyer and let him out of wherever he was? 
2. Did he see the flyer and was like fuck mums looking for me better get home bitches😂
3. Was he stuck somewhere and he just couldn’t get out?
4. Or did he just roam so far bhe got lost?

Please tell me your cat reunification stories I’m so intrigued on where he went!!!!!

Narogz3,Lobe your big noses,7,1c4fbr4,8,"TITLE: Love your big noses (I wrote wrong the title xd)

Lately on social media, especially on Tiktok, I see a lot of people self-conscious about their big noses, especially women. I think this is because it is generally less accepted than in men.

Let me tell you that big noses in women are just as beautiful as small ones. For me, at the level of physical preference, I have always liked women with a prominent nose. I think they are a very unique and beautiful feature.I admit that I feel a little sorry when someone gets a nose job. Obviously, everyone can do what they want with their body and if doing it they are happier..... But I feel that it loses a unique feature and that I also feel that we live too much from the image, from wanting to please everyone physically.

Furthermore, it is like a very identifying trait of your origins and something inherited from your ancestors.

That's why I think we have to learn to accept ourselves as we are. A long time ago, I didn't like my nose, it's not big but I simply didn't like my profile or the shape, but now it has become the feature that I like the most about myself and I can't imagine having another nose.

The same goes for you, I think that we all have a nose that fits perfectly with our features.

In conclusion, love your big noses",1713162440.0,
Maxedlevelanxiety,I have a speech impediment that I let people think is an accent.,26,1c45eij,13,"So I have rhotacism where I have problems with my R’s. However I don’t have it terribly bad. Just with with some ar’s and er’s. And usually just when they end the word. However because of that (most notably when I got in my 20s) people believed I just had an accent. I just let them believe that so I don’t make them feel bad and also because it makes me feel a bit better about it (probably also why I didn’t try to hard as far as speech therapy haha). 

I get asked where I’m from a lot…usually even with a “I love your accent where are you from”. I usually just give the good ole “oh I’m from all different places”.  Or sometimes since a lot of time they think I’m from northeast US…or England??…I just tell them I’m from Boston. Which I am just not Boston Massachusetts, which I find funny.  

Because of this I’ve learned to in some ways enjoy my speech impediment as I view it as my own little unique accent. And this way I don’t hurt anyone’s feelings. The only people who still know it’s a speech impediment is usually those with or who had rhotacism and funny enough kids up to high school. Probably because they just haven’t met very many people with accents, they see classmates with speech impediments sometimes, and because I think most adults figure that another adult wouldn’t have such a thing. 

Would love to hear if anyone else experiences this or anything similar in life where they let people believe something that really is just an impediment etc.

We still live in our hometown and everyone I was in that new friend group with moved away to the city for university. 

What's holding me back though is that because we haven't talked at all since, it might seem weird/awkward to him that i'm randomly reaching out and maybe I should leave it in the past?

OrkosFriend,Colonoscopies without sedation,45,1c3xcda,23,"So I had the procedure done for the first time, and I decided to do it without sedation.

The technician said I was an excellent patient, and it was one of the smoother procedures he's been involved in. I was even able to watch the entire colonoscopy being performed and it was fascinating. 

Not having sedation allowed me to leave immediately and get lunch right after. I'm not saying it was pleasant, but not a horrific experience at all.

I was at the clubs this weekend, kind of like always. It’s like 50% of my life haha.

We were talking about the fact it was getting quiet, everybody was just sitting on the couches or talking with their friends at some tables, so I just bring up the idea of trying to make the dancefloor populated again. I go up and start dancing and also giving the universal signal for “come join me” on the dance floor and some people did!

Some girls joined me on the dance floor followed by some guys and after about a minute almost the whole place was jumping again! I kind of smiled and then decided to keep it going by inviting everyone in my area for a shot, everyone kind of just shouted yes and followed me.

It was like 20 people who came up to the bar with me, I ask for 20 shots and the bartender gave me *that* eyebrow raise and just went to pour the shots. Everyone after that was trying to get my Instagram and high five me, it was great.

Relocating is fine with me as I really don’t like my hometown anyway and I feel stuck here. 

At this time, neither my bf and I can afford to move out on our own. We both have some money saved up and are still working, but it’s still not enough to be able to find a place of our own. I’d also be quitting my job once I start school. Rent where I live is $2500/month on average and I don’t have any other family I could live with. We’ve been together for 5 years now and I visit him almost every month and stay with him at his parent’s house about 4-5 days. They are always very welcoming and don’t mind me staying at their house when I do visit.

My concern is I don’t want to overstep or overstay my welcome. My program would be about 7 months, and after I finish my bf and I will be looking for our own place to live once we save up the money. I’d be more than willing to help clean, pay rent, etc. but I just feel like me asking to live with them temporarily is too much to ask.

Not in like a creepy obsessive way, but in like a ""I wonder how he's doing or what he's up to these days, but it'd probably be weird if I reached out"" type of way. We became very close right away and I'm pretty sure I fell in love with him and he did with me, but we were both young and awkward and neither really made a first move past holding hands and cuddling and saying sweet things to each other🤣 we spent all our time together and were best friends but eventually he got a girlfriend (she pursued him hard lol) and though I was crushed, i hid it well and we remained friends for the remainder of our years in school. 

After graduation, we drifted apart. We would occasionally see one another in passing and wish each other happy birthday on fb but that was about it. I lost his number at some point, possibly even when we were still in school, and didn't bother getting it again because we weren't really talking much anyway. 

Anyhow, it's been close to a decade of pretty much no contact, but the other day it was his birthday. I went to wish him happy birthday on fb but saw he had deleted his page. So I asked a mutual friend for his number so I could tell him happy bday and they happily obliged. 

I texted him. To my surprise, he replied right away. After a few more messages back and forth I asked him if he knew who it was, and he somehow guessed correctly lol. I could not believe it as we had both gotten new phones and new numbers over the years but he still somehow recognized it was me. That felt nice. And I know the friend didn't tell him, because he wasn't 100% sure when I asked if him he knew who I was lol

So, we've been talking for the last few days and getting to know each other all over again. Catching up and all that good stuff. I'm just really happy to talk to him again, even if it just stays texting or even if we stop talking again eventually. It's nice having him back for now.

Remarkable_Put_7952,"Stores and gas stations should sell individual, single use cigarettes ",2,1c3s0xd,14,"Selling single use cigarettes meaning only one cigarette in a plastic container has the potential to help more people quit smoking cigarettes or light/occasional smokers to not get addicted to cigarettes. People who are trying to quit or cut down on tobacco use don't have a choice as to how many cigarettes they want if their only choice is to buy the full pack of 20 cigarettes in a box. With this option, they have the option to buy less than the full pack if they are trying to quit cigarette smoking or not smoke too much. There are people who only smoke a cigarette occasionally or sometimes. One example is if they are planning to drink a lot for the night to help them sober up. Often times, people who are quitting cigarettes or not planning to smoke a lot don't have a choice but to finish all 20 cigarettes since that is the only size that stores offer. Most people would probably think it would be a waste of money to buy a full pack if I probably only intend to smoke 2 or 3 cigarettes so they most likely will end up smoking all 20 to not waste the money. 

With the individual use cigarettes, it can help cigarette smokers who want to quit steadily cut down on their cigarette use and not feel obligated to finish the whole pack for fear of wasting money. It can also help light or non-heavy smokers not get addicted and become chain smokers if they are only buying a couple/few cigarettes at a time.

I know it wouldn't be easy at all, so before I decide to finally search any job over there, I'd like to ask for some advice for the newcomers, and some general doubts: 

Is it really as dangerous as media makes it to be? I wouldn't wanna be living somewhere where I could be shot out of the blue, especially being a foreigner woman (I hope this didn't offend anyone, I know every country has its bad things and that something awful could happen to me anywhere). 

For the language stuff I have no problem; my English is not perfect but I can understand it and use it almost like a native, and they say that Spanish is also very spoken around there. 

Another thing that worries me is rejection: People over there would be able to tell that I'm not American, would that be any issue? Maybe some of them wouldn't be happy that someone from outside goes there and """"steal"""" what's theirs (I'm exaggerating, I know all countries have these kind of people).

0pus3,Don't pursue a creative career as a creative.,4,1c3jnig,7,"I am currently a (20f) junior in industrial design seeking my bachelors degree. I had initially joined my program with a love for art, something I’ve always taken interest in. I did lots of painting in my free time. I wore bold colors and loved to stick out. I then decided to pursue an industrial design degree in hopes of being able to creatively express myself in a “practical” way-through product design. However, as I am finishing up my junior year, I am terribly burnt out.  
I don’t know how often this is still being spoken about, because it seems like everyone wants to be a creative now, but it’s fucking exhausting, and I face tremendous loads of anxiety every morning because of it. The uncertainty of it all has grinded me to a halt and it’s as if I’m petrified to move forward/produce something. Job seeking is the absolute worst. I only wear black/grey clothing now because I subconsciously think people will take me seriously. I’d also like to add that it’s made me extremely over critical towards myself and the world around me. And the worst part is that I’m only a junior in college. I haven’t even gotten the degree yet.  
And so if I could give any creative people advice about careers or futures, not that I am in any position to be doing so as a 20 year old, but I would tell you to get a boring job. If you’re the type of person who feels that their creativity needs to be pursued at some point, then the normal job rules don’t apply to you. Stephen King talks about an artist’s relationship with their art, and the concept of your art waiting to be born. It’s already there, it’s just your job as the creator to excavate it. That is your relationship with art. Emotionally, your “creativity” or the “art is supposed to exist at the center of your life and the boring stupid 9-5 is simply supposed to support that. Get a job that doesn’t require an ounce of your creativity or emotional sweat that you would otherwise use to produce your art.

I'm going to feel like I need to hang out with her everywhere I go when that's not the case.
Sometimes I just want to do things alone. I feel like if I get friends she's going to feel left out and that im leaving her alone. She also wants to get an apartment alone when we both have jobs.

But it did get me wondering: just how many people like and dislike them, and what are people’s feelings and associations with cicada sounds? 

I might be a bit biased because I grew up in the south and am generally a big fan of summer - I like the heat, I like the thunderstorms and humidity, I like slightly noisy fans, summer breezes, and yes, the shhSHHHHHshsssSHHHH of cicadas!

I especially like cicadas sounds because I was usually most aware of them when doing relaxing activities that I greatly enjoy like reading a book, petting my cats, drawing, and sleeping in and napping! Good times.

 1. American Revolutionary War (1775-1783): This period doesn’t exactly match a Uranus return in Gemini, but it’s close to when the United States was founded in 1776, with Uranus in Gemini. The Revolutionary War marked the birth of the nation, coinciding closely with Uranus’ transit through Gemini (May 1767 - April 1779).
 2. American Civil War (1861-1865): The next Uranus in Gemini phase occurred from April 1859 to March 1871. The Civil War, which began in 1861, fits within this timeframe. This war fundamentally reshaped the nation, coinciding with a period of dramatic social and political upheaval as Uranus transited Gemini.
 3. World War II (1939-1945): While the U.S. involvement in WWII began in late 1941, Uranus had entered Gemini in August 1941 and remained there until September 1948. This global conflict greatly influenced the geopolitical landscape, including the U.S.’s role as a world power.

 I can never stop thinking ab them. for example, I was at a family gathering and there was this 20M (were not related in any way) he was talking to me, smiling, teasing me abit. idk if this is relevant but I was sitting on the floor and he was sitting on a chair so I had to look up if I wanted to be face to face with him. he asked for my age then started asking me ab school and I just felt so seen.

GothicFruit98,Is it me or do a lot of men's clothing just look plain?,20,1c2k0zz,9,"I tbh never actually really paid any attention to my style until recently. Never really paid attention because when you are in 110+ degree f weather, for 2.75/4th of the year, you don't care about style at all. All you care about is wearing whatever doesn't cause you to have a heat stroke. Which only really is a t-shirt and gym shorts.

Whenever i go to walmart or ross, i realize a pattern though. All throughout the year, mens clothes basically stay the same. They push for jeans and jackets through the 1.25/4th of the freaking year when it gets cool and cold. But even then, it basically looks the same, just with little different graphics due to the need to advertise their brand with a logo on the actual product.

While i'll just glance the woman's section when i go to the store with my mother to help her out and she goes to the woman's section. And low and behold the freaking contrasts. Women's clothes changes on the season. And not only that, there are actual freaking designs on them, rather than logo of the company who made them.

It's actually the same as hot topic too. (i get graphic tees there) Hot topic is a little bit better for men because the graphics are going to be unique. But i'll quickly glance at the woman's section. Same thing. Ever changing styles with beautiful patterns, even just color clothes are better.

Maggi__Magic,What does your sibling mean to you (if you have one)?,2,1c2xqyv,4,"Hey all. I just wanted to explore what you guys think of your siblings.

For me, my brother has been my most loyal playmate throughout childhood. He is someone I can always call upon when I need a good laugh, and we really enjoy talking about weird, non-sense stuff, things we don't talk about with any other soul. We defend each other when our parents admonish us, and we also help each other in our studies.

My brother has made me learn a lot of important values in life, like kindness, empathy and friendless very early on. **I believe there are some experiences you just can't have even with friends, you can have them only with a sibling, someone your age who grows up with you under the same roof.**

I really love him. From birth to death, sibling relationships are the longest standing, and that's something special. Take my advice, put in some real effort into your relationship with your sibling, it's rewarding as hell!

Anyways, I'll stop ranting now. What are your experiences with your siblings? Really looking forward to your responses. 

Don't hesitate to share your experience even if they aren't particularly great or even toxic. In fact, I'm very much interested to know what leads to poor sibling relationships. We're here to talk and get to know each other, right? I won't judge.

Maybe I have a very limited experience or am biased, but I've always found people with siblings are on average kinder and less selfish than single children. Of course, there are many, many exceptions but.... it's more often true than not.

deanmi1,Thoughts on being objective ,1,1c30ygu,5,"
I have noticed that many people interested in psychology and self improvement providing an idea of “being objective “.
Once I tried to add this mindset into my life but probably failed. 
In that idea were  moments like “stopping your patterns” “stop tagging people and things”  “ don’t take bad things personally” and stuff like that. And yes, theoretically it sounds wise but in practice the only one good thing was to see an alternative point of view. Because when it comes to make a decision it’s tough. I started feeling like I’m a stranger to myself. Maybe I got it wrong but it was feeling like discrediting my personal experiences with situations and people in life. Seems like erasing personality. Though I tried not be radical for real but, in the back of my mind I always had an almost unnoticeable thought - “ if it isn’t this experiment I would make different decision and it could have been called MINE” 
What do you think about “being objective in real life” ? Have you ever practiced this mindset?

gracelyy,How often do you hangout with friends? Curious about friendship dynamics. ,22,1c2g43s,26,"So I met this friend through Bumble BFF. She's a really cool person. We have differing interests at times, but she actually can carry on conversations. It feels nice to have made a friend in adulthood! 

Now usually she will ask, most or all weekends if I wanna hangout that weekend. She's in school but I'm just working a 9-5 through the week, so weekends are really my only free periods.  

The last few times we've hung out. Either just watching a movie through streaming together and the time before that we hung out. Mostly some shopping and getting food. 

However this wekened she asks and as much as I hate to say it, I'm thinking of just relaxing to myself this weekend. Catching up on gaming and the like. 

I feel really bad about it, though! So in the interest of conversation, I'm curious how everyone else's friendships work, as far as hanging out with someone you care about. 

Are you also the type that asks to hangout most or all weekends? Do you hangout with your friends far less, either by design or because of life? Are you the type that wants to hangout all the time? 

I know as we all get older, we do get less energy for things, sometimes friends aswell. Sometimes there also just isn't the time,  and some people need more time to decompress (like me). Some people can hangout more when they're younger but they can't as much later on. I'm only 20 but I've always been an introvert. As much as I enjoy her company, I feel as though I would wanna take breaks sometimes.  And it doesn't change how I feel about her, either!

Don't Stop Believin' is my all time favorite song! The sound is wonderful to me. The lyrics are enjoyable, and the chorus & title say a simple but powerful thing to me - don't stop believing. For me, that's for my goals, my personal worth, others I hold dear. Don't stop believing in myself or them. Yeah, it's a strong sentiment.
To add on to that, when I was 16, almost 12 years ago now, I had an illness that caused me brain damage. It caused memory loss and other factors in my mental snd physical health that looked as if I wouldn't be able to accomplish many of my goals. Not even many common things, such as graduate highschool, get my driver's license. Thankfully, there was plenty of self stubbornness, family & friends push help, that helped me to accomplish these goals along with countless others. And there were outside inspirations that helped to. This song being one of, if not the biggest. And I still hold it as a posative push towards my goals nowadays too. Long story short. This song hits just right for me.

People call or text only when there is a need with a bulletproof excuse that life has become busy. Survival has become more like a competition where we are looking to go ahead rather than giving a helping hand. the so-called famous notion of learning to say no has made us so dry that when we get older there's no one to talk to, no one to love so only thing people settle for is there pets, car collection or expensive dresses. Have we gone down to such a state that beautiful emotions have become rare? And why it has happened?

I was 17 years old, almost literally halfway across the world, and for some reason, I cared, because the people on this podcast I listen to cared, and all the other people listening to this same podcast with me cared. And I remember filled with hope at first when they found his family alive, but then crushed when they found him dead, even though I didn't know any of these people at all, and even though in the grand scheme of things the lives of this one family far away really shouldn't matter to me at all.

When my friends come to me to talk about how they feel I feel extremely disconnected, like I understand what they are going through might be bad for them but I just can't feel empathic for them. The only times I feel empathy is when something happens to my parents or my sister. It's weird to write about this but to summarize, I don't feel the same emotions people do, I don't care about people I don´t know, I can't relate to them. I think that's mostly why I have trouble with romantic relationships and I prefer to spend my time completely alone, because it is the only time I can truly be myself, it is as if I had a collection of disguises that I put on depending on the people around me, and the only time I'm ""disguiseless"" is when I'm alone.

I see a lot of hate both from Redditors and people who don't use the site which I find very unfortunate. This place is legit. Today is 5 years since I made this account, and I really have no regrets. I definitely used to be a bit of a toxic Reddit user, but as I've kept using the site, I kinda appreciate it for what it is. The culture here really is different.

People complain about echo chambers a lot. There are definitely certain opinions that are extremely popular here, but compared to a place like Twitter, I see a lot more diverse discussion here than on other social medias. I stopped caring about the vote count so much, and I realized just how many different opinions that I can find here. It's super easy to curate your feed which I've spent a few years doing.

I think the fact that Reddit has a large focus on comments really sets it for me. The site was (and still kinda is) a forum to start with, and that part of it has stayed fundamental to the growth. Every other site like Instagram has more focus on the posts themselves, but Reddit actually encourages people to discuss ideas because it's all anonymous.

Most of the complaints here are just about how it's run anyway, people disagreeing with the decisions of the higher-ups, and yeah, I won't deny that that's definitely a big issue, but it doesn't impede on the experience too much.

She constantly talks about how some of these experiences were terrible or mad her sad but they were all very good stories. I (22f) felt like I have very minimal exciting stories. 

Yes, I had a few seasons of doing the same things maybe when I was 19-20. I think it took a few bad experiences for my friends and I to stop going out. I guess we kind of got afraid of peoples perceptions of us. Now my life consists of going to work and finishing school. The friends I used to go out with either have boyfriends now or are no longer my friends anymore. 

I dream of going to different cities, dressing up nice, listening to good music while drinking and have a good time. I rarely do my makeup anymore, I rarely shop because I don’t exactly have places to wear these clothes to. On occasion I visit my cousin in texas and we visit different cities, but even the last time I went we spent most of our time watching movies in our hotel room. 

I feel like I have gotten old or at least I feel that I am. Which is a weird concept because I do consider myself very young. I am constantly talking about the fun times I used to have and not the fun I am having now. I explain this to my coworkers who are well over 30/40. They tell me that I am just mature for my age.

If all goes to plan today, I'll have around 27.1 miles ran. FYI I am Canadian but my watch and the treadmill I use, it's all in miles. Which is nice, because a mile is much more than a kilometer.

Cats do not like tuna very much. They do not like fish in general, or any meat other than bird meat. They love meat naturally because they are meat eaters, but they are instinctive hunters of birds, like chickens. They will not like anything else that is difficult to catch, such as fish in the water or large cows.

JNorJT,So today I had to jump over my fence to unlock it,18,1c1lw3h,2,"This is my first ever post on this subreddit.  


So today was garbage collection day in my neighborhood and my usual routine is walk out to my backyard, unlock the gate to my backyard, walk out to my front yard and collect the trash can, roll back the trash can back to the gate of my backyard, open the gate to my backyard, roll the trash can through the gate into my backyard, close the gate, but today life had other plans for me. To preface this, the lock on the gate to my backyard is an old fashioned hook where you close the gate and push the hook through it.  


I observed the garbage truck collecting my trash at around 01:15 PM today and decided to just collect the trash can now so I don't have to do it later at night. There was heavy gusts of wind and a violent rainpour but I just decided to push through it. I opened the door to my backyard and sprinted through my backyard like an olympian while enjoying the feeling of the wind blowing against my hair and the free shower from the water droplets. I unlocked my backyard gate and sprinted across my front yard to get the trash can and begin rolling the trash can across my front yard to finally get this mundane task over with. I approached the gate to my backyard ready to open it and finish this chore once and for all.  


That's when life threw a wrench in my plans. I pushed against the gate to my backyard. It didn't bulge. I pushed again. It didn't bulge. That's when I realized that as I was rolling the trash can across my front yard to the gate of my backyard, the violent gusts of wind of the ongoing storm had blown the gate to my backyard shut and the hook lock to cover it as well. The front door was locked. I had no other way into my house other than the door to my backyard, but that was closed off due the gate being locked. Mind you, I didn't even have my phone, so I couldn't call for help if anything else went awry. That's when a lightbulb shined brightly over my head.  


I pushed the trash can in front of the gate to my backyard. I climbed on top of my trash can, it took me 2 tries. Once on top, I looked down and just braced myself for the inevitable, the call of the void. I jumped over the fence and dropped down. It was a 5 foot drop. My legs didn't break fortunately. I unlocked the gate to my backyard and rolled in my trash can. The mundane task was done. I hope none of my neighbors saw me jumping over my own fence and call the cops on me. It looks truly suspicious from an outsider's perspective. Maybe next time I'll put a brick or something in the doorway so it doesn't shut out on me completely. This entire ordeal lasted 8 minutes, and it was the longest 8 minutes of my life.

Ok-Place-7154,Unveiling the Secrets of a Perfect Cup of Coffee ☕️: Share Your Tips and Tricks!,1,1c23b7q,1,"Hey coffee aficionados!

I've been on a quest to brew the perfect cup of coffee at home, and I've learned a lot along the way. But I know there's a wealth of knowledge out there in this community. So, let's share our collective wisdom!

Here's what I've discovered so far:

Grind Size Matters: The coarseness of your grind affects extraction. Too fine, and you might get a bitter taste; too coarse, and it could be under-extracted.

Water Temperature is Key: I aim for around 195°F to 205°F. It seems to be the sweet spot for extracting those delicious flavors.

The Right Ratio: I've been experimenting with different coffee-to-water ratios. Currently, I'm at 1:16, but I'd love to hear your preferences!

bipolarspiderman,Tips for getting to bed earlier?,2,1c1z1mu,2,"I’m 23F, working full-time and in online grad school part-time (evenings), so my typical day is getting home around 4, hanging out for a bit (cleaning, watching TV, taking care of my pets, scrolling on my phone, going outside), then doing some homework, showering, and getting prepped for tomorrow. 

I’m not crazy busy or anything and I do take about 1 day a week to do something fun for myself, but by the time I’m ready for bed it’s usually like 11:30 or even later and I have to be at work at 8am every day. I’m 10-15 min late almost every day because I don’t actually go to sleep until 1-2am. (Luckily I have the kind of job that I don’t have to clock into, so nothing gets broken if I’m behind in the mornings, which also doesn’t help because it enables me to be late anyway). 

Aside from work though, I’m generally exhausted all the time. If I come home and lay down, I’ll sleep for hours if I let myself. But I can’t do that. Last night I noticed that I was actually dizzy as I shut my computer and got up to get into bed. I passed right out when I did.  

I definitely need to work on self-discipline as my biggest vice is scrolling on my phone at night. If I could just put my down at 11pm, I’d be asleep every night by 11:30 with how tired I am. But sometimes I do that, and then I can’t fall asleep so I pick it back up and I’m stuck for at least another hour.

I don’t like having big parties or going out.

I have to have my own alone date with myself mostly just doing something I really wanna do or try and spending a quality breakfast or dinner with my close friends. 

I always wanna spend it at the beach alone to relax and have a slow time in nature. I like to spend time to reflect on my life — things I’m grateful for and what I wanna be intentional with. But I haven’t planned well in the past years and it’s my birthday next week and I haven’t planned in advance again now I can’t find a perfect beach, sunset and right amount of crowd location for me that I’m frustrated again, my perfectionism and all-or-nothing thinking tendencies kicking in. I should really just book a beach trip anyways no matter if it doesn’t have a sunset view or else I’m gonna regret it but can’t let go of the disappointment of not planning in advance I feel stuck and not inspired for next week. Okay, thanks for letting me rant. 

How do you wanna spend yours and help me change my mind about celebrating my birthday…


Update: I booked a beach trip with a sunset view!

My cousin’s fiancée is having her bachelorette party tomorrow. The first part is a 2 hour boat cruise with all the female relatives and friends including older people like aunts and grandmas. The second part is a male strip show  with just the younger people. 
We’ve paid $85aud ($55usd) for the boat, which includes finger food, “water, soft drink and (some) wine” but byo drinks if you want something else. It’s another $100 ($65) for the show with finger food and bottomless drinks. 
The bride and maid of honour are big drinkers, with the MOH even specifically saying food is provided on the boat despite her opinion being “eating is cheating” when drinking. 
So I assume we’re at least getting tipsy on the boat. And I’m fine to drink the wine provided since I already paid a decent amount. 
But then my mum told me that the mother of the groom (mum’s sister) said they’ve got 12 bottles of wine for the boat for 25-30 people. To me, this seems a little stingy and not enough but I’m not sure. My mum was a bit disappointed because she rarely goes out and of course isn’t going to the show after, so was looking forward to let loose. Perhaps I don’t know what I’m saying and it is a reasonable amount. I’m not sure what the expectations of a bachelorette’s party usually are but I know this is definitely a drinking vibe event. 
What are your thoughts? Should paid events be more fully provided for? Does hosting etiquette vary based on the type of event? What are some cultural rules for hosts providing alcohol in your community? For context, this is in Australia and we have a pretty strong drinking culture here

A few weeks ago I found some old photo albums in my parents' attic while I was visiting. I'd seen some old pictures of both my dad and mom when they were younger before and was never interested but these were from way back when they were in their late teens and early twenties. They got married in their late 20s. They looked so weird and foreign in the photos.

My dad almost always had this what I can only describe as a flirtatious countenance. A weird crooked smile that I have never seen him do which kind of creeped me out a little. My mother on the other hand was your typical tomboy and she barely smiled and always looked like she’s five seconds away from slapping someone. And Jesus she's the most feminine and motherly woman I've ever known. They both totally looked so different. 

So I started asking them a little about their lives before they got married and had us. My mom surprised me by saying that she really didn't like the idea of getting married and having kids in her early 20s, and how much she hated children, that until she met my dad. 

My dad said he was the casanova in his circle of friends and always partying and living life to the fullest. His sole form of communication was inappropriate jokes and laughter on a whim which always got him into trouble. That until he met my mother.

They both agreed that they were good influences in each other’s lives. My father’s happy-go-lucky personality and my mother’s cynical personality complimented each other. They brought out the best in each other. 

Somehow it almost feels like they changed personalities. My father is the melancholic, strict, quiet and at times slightly sombre one now. And my mom is the enthusiastic, high-spirited and life of the party.",1712878331.0,

Formal-Blueberry-203,Poor Grades - Imposter Syndrome,2,1c1m2dz,0,"Throughout school and especially college my GPA was not that great and I did not learn what I should have to have a strong foundation for a future career. My resume was exaggerated and I did on-campus job interviews and I would purposely forget my transcript which was needed for the interview. I would impress them with my BS skills and they would call me with a job offer but needed the transcript for HR and I would not return the voicemails.

 I do feel me landing a good jobs as luck in the end (they forgot about the transcript requirement btw)...but I have to thank a lot of coworkers who were nice, patient and helped me along the way. I got a great Engineering job in 2000 at a Fortune 100 company. Even though I was considered a great employee with great reviews and raises, I knew what my weaknesses were. I always saved and invested early in that career...waiting for the day to be laid off due to performance...Imposter Syndrome haunted me for 20+ years in that career.. 

Now that I am in a totally new different career it's like a breath of fresh air! My wife is very smart and has a good career and a total opposite of my younger self.

Dalton387,I don’t want super nice things.,41,1c10ccw,26,"So I don’t want super nice things. I know some people are into really nice cars, handbags, etc.

My dad and brother, who never wear watches, talk about wanting to “collect” $2,000 watches. They won’t do it, they just talk about it.

It’s cool if someone wants that, but to me, it’s not ideal. The reason is, you’re too precious about it. I’ve found that when you have really nice things, you worry about them. Big or small. I have a kindle and on my last one, I bought a real leather cover. I found out it absorbs water spots and discolors. It gets scratches, etc. So I feel more protective of it, worry about it more, etc.

I was happier with a cheap, black faux leather cover. I didn’t think twice about tossing it around, setting it on wet surfaces, etc.

It’s really the same with anything. If you had a $2,000 watch, what would you do with it? You’re not gonna wear it as you’re shit kicking around the yard and getting dirty. You’re most likely not gonna wear it to work. So what? Special occasions, clubbing while you’re young enough and trying to impress people and imply you live above your means?

It’s gonna sit in a drawer somewhere and you’ll never wear it. 

Instead, you can get a decent looking watch for a $100-200, and you’ll get a lot of use out of it. You won’t be so precious about it, so you’ll wear it a lot more, not worrying about it, and will get more use and enjoyment out of it.

So I think really high end stuff is worse to have than just nice stuff.

Edit: For clarity, because I think people might be misunderstanding me. I’m not advocating for only buying cheap things. I spend money on quality products that will perform better or last longer.

I’m really talking about that monetary line you cross, where you become scared to use a product for its intended purpose. Things you leave sitting on a drawer, because you’re scared of theft or damage.

I’m all for spending a little extra money on quality. As long as it’s something your comfortable utilizing.",1712792628.0,

I also go to college in a suburb, and I've been yearning for city life for a while now.

I can't wait for the freedom, the lack of academic stress, and being closer to my family. A lot of my friends said they're worried that their life is going to ""end"" once they graduate, but I really can't wait for this new beginning.

Throoowaway4989,Feeling hopeful for the future,2,1c0ira4,0,"(I don’t know if this is the right sub but I still feel like I needed to post this somewhere)

For most of my life I’ve never had a direction I was leaning towards. I did fine in high school, but I was never a top student and I wasn’t social at all. After I graduated from there I didn’t know where I wanted to take my life moving forward. Everyday after school I just went back home and stayed inside all day- rarely did I ever go out to a special event or a social gathering. 

My physical health kept fluctuating, as there was a period where I was losing weight but now I’m sitting here overweight constantly feeling tired. I only just recently started unpacking events that affected my mental health with an awesome therapist. I’ve had therapy before but they’ve never really been helpful to me. Before that, I just chose to never really think about how I’m doing and why I’m like this. 

Even when I finally became an adult I still felt like my life was aimless. It’s just that I actually had to get off my ass and do stuff like work a job and go to community college, so it was better than it was in high school. But the other problems are still there. Including skin issues, issues with my general appearance, & my lack of real hobbies outside of a job & school. 

A little later today, something’s going to happen that really put things into perspective for me. Just for context, my therapist talked about cherry picking & hyperfocusing on the bad examples in life and how that turns into having a negative mindset. Which in turn affects your actions. He told me that it isn’t good to put yourself down and make yourself out to be useless. Instead, he said I should turn moments like that around and instead use it to really see what I’ve accomplished in my life. 

As for what’s going to happen, I’m meeting with a nutritionist to create plans for bettering my physical health. But now I’m actually meeting with someone, and we’re about to create a plan to help my body and even let me sign up for nutrition classes - I was supposed to do something like that last year but ended up not wanting to do it due to my own stubbornness. 

I’m also taking multiple classes and I’m doing well in them. I took 1-2 classes in my past semesters and do okay at them. Anytime I took more then, I ended up failing almost all of those classes. Now I’m juggling four of them at once, and while I’m not doing good in one of them, I’m doing extremely well in the others. I still suck at tests so I think that will cause me to take a hit, but the semesters almost over and I’m on track to pass all of them at this rate. 

This made me think that I’m on the right track for my future. I still don’t know if I’m gonna continue school, I don’t know what job I’m gonna apply for, I don’t know what I want to do long term, and I’ll still have to worry about that. 

But for going to class & going to a nutritionist, Im actually setting out and going through with both of them. I finally know what I want to do for something, and im also feeling motivated to do them. 

It does make me feel like this will be my first actual step into planning out the rest of my life. And it doesn’t scare me",1712746631.0,

Now, by no means would I consider myself a chef or anything but I know a few things here and there to survive of off. The thing I didn’t know was how frustrating preparing meals for a single person is. 

First of all coming home from a 9 to 5 and having nobody there who could prepare dinner for you means that now you have to cook after a long day of work. Now I started cooking over the weekend in larger quantities and store the extra for the week, but then it got frustrating to eat the same meals for dinner over and over again. This also led me to ordering food from outside more often than I’d like to. 

Furthermore, shopping and cleaning for a single person is also starting to get frustrating. Buying a loaf of bread and only using half the bag because it expired before I could single handedly use it gets really annoying. Even spending so much time cooking and cleaning just for me to eat the meal in less than 10 minutes is getting annoying. How do people who live/ have lived alone prepare their meals?",1712693920.0,

Hair wash days are 12-13 minutes. I start by using a wet brush to make it easier to shampoo. It takes 3-4 pumps of shampoo and vigorously getting to every crevice to properly wash my hair.

Background-Zombie689,Before Smartphones Stole Our Childhood: Memories of a Simpler Time,7,1bzwkns,5,"Growing up as a boy in the early 2000s, life was a kaleidoscope of simple joys and carefree adventures. At school, passing notes was our form of social media - folded pieces of notebook paper covertly exchanged, containing our deepest secrets and silliest jokes. Recess was sacred, a time when the playground transformed into a battlefield, a racetrack, or a secret hideout. The promise of summer break was a shimmering oasis on the horizon, an endless stretch of bike rides, swimming pools, and video game marathons.



Holidays were pure magic through my younger eyes. Halloween meant morphing into whatever superhero or monster I was obsessed with that year. The giddy thrill of racing through the neighborhood with my best buddies, our plastic pumpkins overflowing with cavity-inducing loot. Christmas brought an avalanche of Legos, action figures, and video games - but the real wonder was in the rituals of hanging ornaments on the tree, leaving out cookies for Santa, and watching my favorite holiday cartoons in my PJs.



Snow days were a rare and precious gift from the universe. The world outside hushed and glittering, full of snowball fight potential. Bundling up in layers until I could barely move my arms, then plunging into the crystalline expanse to build snow forts and wage icy battles. Sipping hot chocolate that scorched my tongue, mini marshmallows leaving a sticky moustache on my upper lip. Peeling off wet layers and collapsing in front of the TV, my fingers and toes tingling as they thawed.



Weekends were for neighborhood adventures, a pack of boys on bikes exploring our little slice of the world until the streetlights flickered on, our signal to race home. We'd invent elaborate games of war and espionage, build precarious ramps to launch our bikes off of, tell ghost stories in dark basements. Scraped knees and bruised egos were par for the course, but so was the deep contentment of belonging to my tribe.



Without smartphones and social media vying for my attention, I had the freedom to get lost in my own imagination. Devouring ""The Hardy Boys"" and ""Harry Potter"" books, dreaming up my own adventures. Spending hours building Lego worlds and acting out epic storylines with my action figures. Sprawling on the living room floor over a half-finished puzzle or engaged in ruthless Mario Kart battles with my siblings.



It's a bittersweet realization that the carefree days I remember so fondly are increasingly out of reach for today's kids. With 53% of children now having a smartphone by age 11, the lure of the screen is hard to resist. Instead of passing notes in class, they're texting. Rather than making up games outside with the neighborhood kids, they're engrossed in virtual worlds. The simple joys of getting lost in a book or building something amazing out of Legos often lose out to the allure of Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.



While technology has its benefits, the hours many kids now spend glued to their devices come at a cost. Experts worry about the impact on everything from attention spans to social skills to mental health. There's a risk that critical real-world experiences and hands-on play are being displaced by digital distractions. The kind of imaginative, emotionally present, in-person interaction that defined childhoods like mine is becoming rarer for the smartphone generation.



Looking back, I see how those years shaped the man I would become. I learned the value of friendship and loyalty, the thrill of pushing my limits and testing my courage. I discovered the power of my own creativity and ingenuity, the simple joy of living in the moment. The importance of play, of laughter, of making my own fun in an era before technology did it for me.



Perhaps in reminiscing with such appreciation, we can be inspired to preserve the best parts of a tech-free childhood for kids today. To encourage them to use smartphones as tools, not crutches. To balance screen-time with green-time. And to interact with the real world as richly and curiously as the virtual one. The core ingredients of a magical childhood haven't changed - they may just need a bit more nurturing in the digital age.



I hope I never lose touch with that carefree boy who saw adventure around every corner, who believed anything was possible if he could imagine it. He's still there inside me, ready to remind me what really matters whenever I start to forget. So here's to the boys of the early 2000s and the childhoods that shaped us - may we never stop exploring, dreaming, and playing like the kids we once were.",1712680406.0,

If you can understand the story, you're absolutely fluent in English, because how the hell could you understand this nonsense otherwise?

 

Once upon a time, in a town not too far from the beaten path, lived Jack, a jack-of-all-trades but a master of none. He had his fingers in many pies, from painting houses to tuning pianos, yet he never really hit the jackpot with any of his ventures. One day, he decided he'd had enough of beating around the bush and made up his mind to pull up his socks and throw his hat into the ring of the restaurant business.

He found an old, run-down diner at the edge of town that looked like it had seen better days. ""This place is going to be a tough nut to crack,"" he thought, but he was determined to turn it into a gold mine. He worked day and night, burning the midnight oil, to give the diner a facelift. He had a feeling that if he could make a silk purse out of this sow’s ear, he’d be laughing all the way to the bank.

Opening day was a hit. The townsfolk came in droves, curious to see Jack’s new venture. The diner, now named ""The Rolling Stone,"" was the talk of the town. Jack, however, didn’t rest on his laurels. He knew that to keep the ball rolling, he needed to come up with something unique, something that would keep his customers coming back for more.

That’s when he decided to throw caution to the wind and introduce a theme night at the diner. ""Let’s kill two birds with one stone,"" he thought. ""We’ll spice things up a bit and attract a crowd that’s looking for more than just a meal."" The first theme night was a roaring success. People didn’t just eat; they enjoyed an experience, and word spread like wildfire.

But not everyone was over the moon with Jack’s success. The owner of the swanky restaurant across the street, Mr. High-and-Mighty, saw Jack’s diner as a thorn in his side. He had been the big cheese in town before Jack came along and wasn’t about to let some upstart steal his thunder without a fight. He decided to throw a wrench in the works and started spreading rumors about the diner's hygiene standards.

Jack, however, didn’t let the grass grow under his feet. He knew that actions speak louder than words, so he invited the local health inspector to do a surprise inspection of the kitchen. The inspector gave the diner a clean bill of health, and Jack used the report to clear the air, proving that his diner was as clean as a whistle.

Feeling like he was back to square one, Mr. High-and-Mighty decided if you can’t beat them, join them. He approached Jack with a white flag, suggesting they bury the hatchet and work together to promote the town’s dining scene. Jack, always one to see the glass half full, agreed, believing that two heads are better than one.

In the end, Jack’s diner didn’t just survive; it thrived, becoming a cornerstone of the community. And as for Jack and Mr. High-and-Mighty, their unlikely alliance showed that even the most bitter rivals could come together for the greater good. It was a case of all's well that ends well.",1712714688.0,
Positive_Bar8695,Are there many places open late after 6 pm where you live apart from pubs and nightclubs?,6,1bzw90i,17,"Hello everyone. 

So I posted something similar on another forum, but I am curious to know, are there many late evening cafes, restaurants, or 3rd spaces  where you live that stay open passed 6 pm? I am talking more specifically away from continental Europe. I am a blind person and I live in Ireland, 

I have noticed that in Ireland in general and in the city where I live specifically , there are a huge lack of these sorts of places. To put things into context, there was a time when there was a cinema in the city centre, a bowling alley, a place for live gigs and musicians, a late night coffee shop, but all of that is gone now. 

In my city for example, most independent coffee shops are closed at 3 or 4 pm. The only cafe that is open in the city at night here is Starbucks. There are so few places to go at night to meet new people in the city apart from pubs. 

Now, I have gone to pubs sober before and as a nondrinker, but I have never enjoyed these kinds of places, as a lot of people here go to pubs mostly just to get drunk. Another reason was because my hearing is much better than even my parents hearing i was told, they told me I could literally hear a pin drop.

Music has been a huge part of my life, especially music production. I have a lot of friends who are into music production, but they tend to live in quite far away places. having said that though, I recently met a friend from London who loves music production just as much as I do, and i will hopefully get to meet him at some stage this year which I am really excited about. 

Having traveled throughout much of continental Europe with my parents, I noticed there were so many places to go in the evenings such as late night cafes, pleasant squares to walk around etc. it was a really nice feeling. 

One of the reasons why i think there aren’t a lot of late night cafes open in Ireland in particular is that there aren’t enough non drinkers to keep these places open for business and are thus not profitable, which I think just goes to show the insanity of the society in which we live. However, a lot of young people feel very lonely here especially, and I am concerned what things are going to be like for the next generation. 

Another observation i made , in the times I have gone to pubs, and places like Starbucks, is that many people in those places I was at mostly either stick to themselves or stick with their group they originally came with. 

Also, Ireland has never really had the type of cafe culture that exists in large parts of continental Europe. A lot of the times I have gone to cafes with my parents even during the day, and the experience was very different. I don’t really know how to explain it, but it felt very rushed, and a lot of the time I barely had my cup of tea finished when we were rushed out the door to make room for the next customer. 

And before anyone asks, I use a screen reader and bluetooth keyboard. ",1712679617.0,

United_Coconut2162,How can we make our 10 Yr Class Reunion enjoyable?,1,1c08wb3,8,"Any advice for planning 10 year our class reunion?

We are in the midst of planning on want to make it an enjoyable experience, I understand the dread that comes with it so I am hoping to avoid that. Was there anything at yours that you liked? Or even what made it awful? 

We are planning ours at a local outdoor venue, catering some apps and hors d'oeuvres with a no host bar. We are adding yard games like corn hole, a non fire, music from graduating year, some fun ice breakers throughout, Polaroid photo back drop and whatever else we come up with. The goal is to give everyone something to do, be relaxed and have fun. 

 Sadly our budget from school is $250 so we do need to charge tickets, and are working at dialing in the ticket cost. I am hoping we can have some funds left over to maintain a class website, everyone can buy tickets, look up class mates, add contact info, purchase memorabilia, and use this website for years to come instead of relying on Facebook or word of mouth only. If we magically do have funds remaining, we will save it for future reunions, but are thinking we will need to charge around $65 a person. I have seen other classes at different schools charge this or even up to $80 but looking for feedback on this. Anyways, would love feedback, tips and tricks, etc. ",1712711213.0,
anotherinma,I think I might have being scammed and I need to talk about it,12,1bzplhh,10,"Long story short (as Taylor would say), I do some little jobs here and there correcting academic written texts. Articles, publications, dissertations... whatever. On Friday I was contacted by a girl that needed her doctoral thesis conclusion's corrected. We agreed on a price and she told me she needed the documents back by Monday morning. I worked my hours through the pages and got the document ready by Sunday afternoon.

Before I continue, I may clarify the following. When you work on a company or for whatever job you are in, you work through the month and expect the money at the end. So, with that in mind, I told her the total amount of what she had to pay me and sent her the documents back, explaning to her everything she will be reading.

That was on Sunday afternoon. Now it is Tuesday morning where I am from, and she does not answer back to me. I have asked her twice, one because I did not receive the payment and the second time because she did not answer me. She left me on READ.

I entered the train together with 2 people (around 40-50), and sat next to them at a seat where four people can sit and face each other. 5 seconds later, the third person came, so the seats were full. Then the fourth person came, and something extreme weird happened. The person next to me said to me in English, “he needs to sit here”. The fourth person was young, about 25-30 years old, obviously not disabled, and the seat is not a priority seat. I felt that how can someone be SO RUDE?! So I told him, “but I came here before him.” Then the fourth person maybe felt embarrassed and said something (probably like it’s ok) in French, which I didn’t understand. He made an eye contact that I can keep sitting there.

Btw I’m Asian and I almost feel this behaviour is like the American bus racial segregation. Or is this behaviour normal for French standard? How will you react to this? I'm a bit introverted and want to shout back next time when this happens again.

(ps: The train was very full when the person talked to me, so I cannot really move to another seat and I have to stand.  
Sorry for using ""racial segragation"". Somehow this is the story jumps out of my mind regarding this behavior, forcing someone to leave their seat. 

Thank you for all your replies. I think I’m not upset anymore. I also talked to a friend who were on the same train. She sat a bit away from me so I thought she didn’t notice it earlier. But she told me that she had the memory because the person next to me talked to me so loudly, and he’s definitely an asshole. 🙉 )",1712521525.0,

curious-quark,A battle with the apple 😅,6,1bz8c6l,4,"
I’m 30 years old. I am fine with eating vegetables but had a strong dislike for fruits ever since I was a kid (No allergies or anything, I just never  liked the smell or the sweety taste of them) and my parents never forced me to eat them as well. Barring mango and guava, I never ate much fruit until recently. 

For the last two years, I have been very conscious about my eating habits and focussed on improving my wellbeing and started to eat stuff I never thought I would eat in my life for example - yoghurt or fish.

Today, I decided to go a little more out of my comfort zone and bought a small box of apples for the first time in my life. 

I called up my mom and told her I’m finally going to eat an apple and she’s totally a urprised and suggested to eat with some pickle just in case if want to avoid the difficult sensation. 

I was nervous but finally prepared my mind and kept a glass of water next to me just in case I don’t like taste, I could swallow the pieces like a tablet lol. (I know it’s getting dramatic as if I’m swallowing some poison lol). I ate everything else on my lunch plate and procrastinated apples to the end, they were ready to defeat me if I escaped and gave up on eating them. 

I was also divided whether to eat with peel or without. So, I just cut it in half and peeled one piece and kept the other intact. And finally I gained courage and took a bite from one of them and ate it. It activated my saliva glands and generated a little whirlpool of sweetness in my mouth. I felt that little discomfort of trying something new for the first time but I didn’t find the sweetnesss too overwhelming but it’s not very pleasant either.

I got used to the flavour after a couple of bites and finished the rest of them. I looked at the peels with pride in my eyes. Yes, finally I won the battle with the apple. 😅

I have three more to eat and I hope I wouldn’t be as nervous and get used to eating apples as a part of my diet going forward. ",1712607853.0,

I always want to say something when I see them but I don't want to be a weird adult telling kids what to do, or come across like a jerk. There are no sidewalks in this neighborhood and they walk along a busy street to get to their bus stop with their backs to traffic. The shoulder is about 18 inches and sometimes they cross into the street a little without even looking behind them, because there are garbage cans in the shoulder blocking the narrow path.

Idk if parents just aren't teaching kids how to walk on the street anymore or what, but they all do this. You're supposed to walk on the left, facing oncoming traffic so you can see the cars and move if they're going to hit you. These kids are just walking without a single clue and it scares me.

rajasimha,I left a group of friends to watch the sunset alone and I feel bad. ,99,1byjcli,20,"So me and a friend are visiting another friend in a major city in the US. This friend who is hosting was super kind and got tickets for us and his bf to go to the top of a skyscraper to see the sunset. 

He could only get entry for 3:30PM so he had planned for us to stay up there until sunset. Which ilI was fine with at that point. 

Come 5:15PM we were at the top, we had finished seeing everything at the top and it was still 2+ hours to sunset. 

Everyone except this friend who booked the tickets, was okay with heading out of the top early and find a park in the west side to go see the sunset. But he was pretty adamant about staying there to watch the sunset. We tried convincing him but he just wouldn't budge. He was even okay with staying up top alone to watch sunset while the rest of us went somewhere else. 

I stayed until 5:30, but then I started getting antsy for whatever reason. My phone was about to die. All the people walking around suddenly made me feel anxious, and there was 2 whole hours which I felt I could use to charge my phone up, and get to a park, and idk what came over me, it I suddenly decided to just leave alone. 

My friend even almost pleaded for me to stay saying the sunset will be amazing (which I had no doubt of)

And I went back to where we were staying, charged up my phone, take public transit to this park where I enjoyed the sunset. Alone. 
I have no regrets doing this. I got to explore the city a bit, go to a park I haven't been before, charged my phone, my anxiety hasn't gone away completely but I feel much better. 

But now I'm on my way back to meet with my friends again for dinner and I feel bad that I left. But I really didn't want to spend this 2 hours sitting around doing nothing. Sure there was a bar on top but I don't drink. The view had started to become stale for me too.

This experience reminded me of why I began drawing and writing stories when I was a child.

I have an air nomad jacket (easily my element) & hat. I celebrate the show with others like my boyfriend & other friends. Even strangers online (like the sub here on Reddit). I have the storyline memorized. The characters are heavily analyzed & understood by me. BUT... ONLY The Last Airbender...

I obviously, absolutely, LOOOOOOOVVVEEEE the show & would love to able to call myself a nerd in the topic, but I feel I don't hold enough knowledge or experience beyond the original series to claim myself as such.


Another example!
I'm a biology major at my university. Ecology is my main topic of focus, however, I have a few other topics in biology I have a passion for as well. One of my biggest being ornithology. Birds. They've been a love of mine as long as I can remember.

I know hardly anything about birds besides common knowledge & a few odd facts. I even have trouble identifying local species besides a few. I want to be a bird nerd. Always have. I hold curiosity equivalent to a bird nerd in the topic, but I lack the knowledge to claim to be one I feel.

I do it beacuse I kinda got jaded after talking with my friends beacuse whenever I try to talk them about stuff I'am currently into they listen to it and go like this ""It's cool stuff i really like that you told me that"" and thats it they don't tell me there opinions about it or any meaningful conversation comes out of it (I REALLY tried to make them talk with me about stuff) and then we go through it again with another  subject or just talk about meanigless things and after few years of that I closed myself a little and now they are confused why i don't talk as much beacuse they don't wan't or can't talk about things they like.

If you are not comfortable I understand because you don't know me so i try tell about my interests I Am currently really into Warhammer 40k lore, I love games especially story driven games, I like training physicly, I like books, films, anime, manga and various types of music.

I wouldn’t say I’m shy around cameras but I don’t know how to do like a “serious” pose. I’m also trying to fix my posture and clear up acne which isn’t a problem. Basically I’m trying to fix some things about myself that I’ve been insecure about.

I recently started thinking about modeling because I’ve always wanted to be in some way part of the media. I’ve also thought it was cool that beauty influencers, gamers, cooks, and more have made their own communities. I want to be part of that, of course I probably won’t be big but that’s fine lol. 

So, I’ve been trying to do some research and figure out what to do first but I’m at a loss. I plan to start doing something once I’m 18, just so I have a lot more freedom do things.

I'm pretty sure the oldest memory I have was when I was a baby and I was freaked out at a little talking stuffed toy bear, kinda copper colored with black buttons on the back to press and a little top hat lol 

I remember crying really hard about it and screaming cause it freaked me out, also the bear kinda moved it's arms as well, I was at someone else's house with my mom and another girl I don't recognize (I remember this girls face but Idk who the heck she is/was)

What was weird is, I was really low to the ground in my memory and I can still remember that my voice was clearly a baby's or at least younger than 2.

Does anyone else remember being a baby? 

What was your oldest memory even if it wasn't you as a baby? 

I'm just really curious cause I've been thinking about it and wondering if anyone else remembers being a baby.

I have plenty of memories that I'm sure were me as a baby but I think this one was the first for some reason.

I've always heard people say we can never remember when we were that little (or at least in detail) but I'm pretty sure it's not impossible to remember those things even vividly (plus the house I remember being at I described to a parent and they're sure it was one of their friends houses at the time)

I work 9-5 job that I love, the only thing is, I am separated from my family and I live in a different country but whenever I visit my hometown (where my family lives), going back to work kills me mentally because the feeling of safety and love I feel here is not something I can feel anywhere else. 

I had a great childhood and great memories, my little brother and me spent so much time together and every time I come visit now, he looks like he grows older rapidly. I can also see it on my mother and father of course but the feeling of time passing and the thought of this place, my home, not being a place where they will be “forever” kills me. My brother is soon going abroad to college so I will see him even less frequently. 

I’m basically thinking about all the good time I’ve had here and how much I appreciate having them here right now but again thinking about the future and how that won’t be the case “forever”. So both past and future thoughts are making me feel very sad.

For me it’s:
- 35% work (1.5 jobs and stuff that contributes to leveling up at work)
- 35% self (including working out, solo time and hobbies)
- 20% friends (hanging out, planning trips, texting and calling)
- 10% relationships (I’m single, so this is dating for me)

For me right now this is *okay* - I’d prefer 30% friends 25% self but I need to make more friends for that haha

I find that when I’m in a relationship it takes 5% away from work and 15% away from self and ends up like this:

- 30% work
- 20% self
- 20% friends
- 30% partner (spending time together, also emotional energy of planning stuff for the relationship and thinking through conflict and stuff)

This is hard for me, it makes me feel stretched thin and I haven’t really found a way to find a good balance when in a relationship. My hobbies and working out tend to get cut in half or even a quarter. I also feel less present when with friends.

Emsflyer1984,Ocean Vs. Desert: A Wanderers Question,5,1bxg8di,3,"Hey all, I have more of a philosophical topic here, coming from myself who is a wandering soul stuck in place.  I live in New England (USA), close to the ocean and the mountains.  I've always lived near the water.  I often think about where I would go if I had no commitments, no responsibilities holding me back.  I tend to gravitate toward water, specifically the ocean.  I know lots of people who feel this way.  Who would always rather be by the sea.  I think that from the beginning of human existence, something has called people to the ocean.  Then there are others who just HAVE to be in the desert, or the mountains.  I know people who feel more at home in the hot, dry climates then anywhere else, with no water in sight.  Even people who grew up near the water who always knew they'd end up far away from it.  So, what is it that causes wandering souls like mine to want to be in certain types of places?  Is it our upbringing?  Is it something engrained deeper in us that has pre-determined the physical path we naturally want to follow?

This question may not mean much to those of a more ""practical"" nature, who make decisions based on pro's and con's and realities, but for some of us, where we want to be is a function of how we FEEL about a place, even a place we've never been.  What do you think?",1712422346.0,

Lucky for me back in November I paid $300 to have a couple deer I killed to be processed so my freezer was stocked full of ground venison and various cuts of meat. So during this time when I was extremely broke I was eating nothing but ground venison and I mean NOTHING else. I would eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I got extremely lean during this time but it was almost a laborious event to sit down and eat it after a few days. Deer meat is extremely lean and has almost zero fat so in order to keep my energy up I would pretty much have to eat a pound of venison each meal which got old really quickly.

Fuzzy-Dinosaur,Anyone else kinda scared about the future because of AI?,18,1bx3y5x,28,"I've kinda been on a doomscrolling binge lately regarding AI, and it genuinely is disturbing how much it has progressed so quickly like OpenAI's Sora which can generate videos with ridiculous accuracy to real-life, it has flaws but by-and-large, is almost indistinguishable from real videos. Of course other AI software like ChatGPT, Dall-E, Claude are also extremely impressive.

Life is so normal right now, but I'm kind of dreading what's to come. For example what are the societal ramifications? The job loss that will cripple so many industries, the  barrage of generated mindless content, fake video recordings that will harm people's reputation etc etc etc. Not to mention the countless leading AI researchers like Geoffrey Hinton basically spelling it out to us that we're screwed.

And this is only right now, what happens when AGI is created? The risk goes from a societal one to an existential one.  What does it even mean to be human at that point? If AI is just bigger, faster, better at everything. If anyone has watched Wall-E, the humans in there are like a nightmare scenario in my opinion, some people may find that pleasurable, but it's like some cruel joke if that becomes a reality in my honest opinion.

Sometimes I feel like I'm in a dream, this stuff doesn't really feel real, and it kind of make me feel a bit sad for the future.

And I kinda  wish I was born in a different time, I'm not a fan of an internet-addicted, terminally online society, much less one that includes AI. I hope AI can advance medicine, but I'm not a fan of everything else.

I hope in all honesty, AI doesn't advance any further due to hardware limits, or maybe LLM's aren't the right architecture, but that feels like basically impossible and we will just keep accelerating into who knows what. Right now it feels like progress for the sake of progress. I don't really want to live in a world like this if anyone gets me? It just feels less and less in touch with the human experience.

Oh, and the idea that you like tech and programming makes them think your some nerdy guy who does nothing in their life other than study and work. And the idea that you like “old” music means you’re an “outdated” guy.

It’s like watching someone confidently walk into a glass door they didn’t see—embarrassing but somehow endearingly human.

It was a mix of shock, awkward apologies, and laughter that followed, making it a story that the local and the tourist likely won't forget.

I been noticing people who used to prefer to take shoes off whenever possible become more laid back on it after participating in intensive physical activities for a while, and seem to leave their shoes on indoors, on the couch, on chairs and seats etc?

Is it due to them being more comfortable in shoes that it almost becomes an extension of their body overtime? And that shoes become more than just covering for their feet but tools of practicality especially if they participate in running, basketball playing, skateboarding, parkour, etc. 

Obviously not everyone is like this, though I do know some people who used to always  them off now prefer to stay in their Jordan’s or other footwear from time to time while chilling at home sometimes not thinking about it.  After a while of being involved in sports.

Older people will say that you need to travel more while you're still young, and while I agree... where is the money coming from? What if you don't have the funds necessary to go where you'd like?

PrincessGamer2012,I'm weird. Do you think you're weird?,57,1bwku7i,114,"I'm 15f if that clarifies anything

I have always been a weird person. I feel that's because I act far too childish. My classmates have always been more mature than me. When I was in third grade they were all watching nickelodeon shows/dramas when I was watching Sofia the first. When I started watching nick shows they were watching tiktok and the likes.

And I act so childish too. It's always in hindsight that I realised I was laughing at something more than the others, or I was more expressive than the others, or I made more of a fuss over something than the others. Even when I'm on the internet I act weird. I went on 13+ sites when I was 12 (I don't really think that's a big deal anymore) and when I see my posts and comments from back then and compare them to someone else I know when they were the same age as me I only cringe at my own. Even these days I regret posting something two seconds after it's already done.

Sometimes a friend asks me what I do for a hobby, and my response is ""play Roblox!"" When their response is something more age appropriate like reading a book. And when I read books I read books of a lower level. Don't get me wrong, I can read adult books with no difficulty, I just find them boring.

So I'm weird and childish. Are you weird? I didn't necessarily mean that in a bad way.

Alternative_Run_6116,"Using a ""bad word"" in school when I was very young",32,1bwn31k,11,"When I was about 5 or 6 years old, I heard the word ""bogus"" on TV, and so the next day at school I called my friend Kyle bogus. I didn't necessarily know what it meant, I was just practicing with language, as most children that age do.

As soon as the word ""bogus"" left my lips, every adult around me gasped and started yelling at me. They told me that I should never EVER say that, and they whisked Kyle away to a table across the cafeteria and started comforting him, all while throwing the occasional death-glare back across the cafeteria at me.

My little brain assumed that ""bogus"" was a very bad word, like ""hell"" or ""crap.""

Well, I realized in the years after this incident that Kyle was mentally challenged, which explains why the teachers didn't want me calling him ""bogus,"" but at the time I had no idea—he was just another one of the kids in my class.

But that realization didn't change my relationship with the word ""bogus""—in fact, I still feel an aversion to using it in conversation to this day.

What to do. They can't keep growing in the engine. I put on gloves, found a box and carefully transferred the nest. 

The mom was frantic, as we had moved the car into the garage to do our exploring. I had put the box in a large planter, but momma squirrel didn't seem to be getting it. So, I put peanut butter oña spoon and left it right by the box. She found the peanut butter..and then found the babies!

Next thing I knew, she was carrying them across the yard and depositing them in a tree that was hit by lighting a few years ago. One of the deep V spots had detritus that served as a temporary nest. They looked so exposed and cold. Did I do the right thing? Should I have just left the nest (and the car) so they could grow old enough to survive?

GreasyPeter,What are your crazy stories? What is your go-to story if you meet someone and you want to seem like an interesting person to them?,5,1bwtq54,2,"I'll start. This is actually my story of why I have stories so I feel like it's pretty fitting.

When I was in my mid-20s I broke up with my long-time girlfriend. She's the only women I had done anything with at all up to that point (I was not traditionally schooled by American standards so i did not get any socialization as a child) so I literally had zero clue how to meet women. I had no social skills, no ability to talk to anyone, I had no idea how I'd even attract another women. My ex I had met online so I hadn't even had to go on a traditional date up to that point. So I did what any self-respecting internet loser would do: I asked search engines for help. ""How to be attractive to women"". That google search fundamentally changed the course of my life forever. 

I got dragged down a rabbit hole and gave myself somewhat of a crash course on everything from holding small conversations all the way up to reading body language and understanding social queues. I realized that one of my biggest problems with conversing wasn't that I was terrified of it, it was that I literally had nothing to add to conversations. My life was the pinnacle of boring outside having been emotionally abused by my father as a child. Someone would start a conversation and once it ventured away from work or maybe a small subject then the conversation would be over. Plus, nobody wants to be recanted stories about how one time you went temporarily blind while being yelled at when they barely know you. So I googled ""How do I get stories"" and the consensus seemed to be ""Go fucking do shit"". So I did. I stopped allowing anxiety to control what I did and I lived by the motto ""If it's a little scary but you wanna do it, always do it"". For the next 10 years my life became something to talk about. 

I moved to another state, became a drunk, got sober, had a drug problem for 1-2 summers, had a gun put to my head, got punched in the mouth over a dog fight (and I don't even own a dog), gained and lost friends, gained and lost girlfriends, watched one friend literally go insane, got to be the only non-Fijian who the local Fijian population would allow to Fijian-only gatherings, floated tons of rivers, filmed an apartment burning down during a wildfire, woke up in strange places, made a LOT of mistakes, have a lot of regrets, but ultimately I realized I wouldn't go back and change anything because even the regrets have forced me to really understand myself better. 

So, the moral of my story so far I guess is this: If it scares you a little but you wanna do it...you should probably do it. Oh, and don't expect being amicable to always get you out of trouble. No matter how nice you are sometimes someone just WON'T like you.",1712352634.0,

Silent_Effective_320,Truck drive here. Anybody have questions about my job. ,14,1bwgfrr,35,"Earlier this week some posted that semi trucks shouldn’t be in the left lane. Got me thinking thinking about how little the average person understands about the trucking industry.  

I will address the left lane part first. There are areas where it is illegal to drive a truck in the left lane (sometimes left two). This is generally on roads with 3 or more lanes in each direction. Trucks are almost always governed. Some as low as 60 (a few rare ones at 55 but those are usually local) and up to 75. Given the fact that most interstate highways are two lanes trucks need the ability to pass in the left lane.

 It is frustrating to everyone when a truck is creeping by another while passing in the left lane. But even that is necessary. We are often on a tight deadline or trying to avoid another night on the road away from our family. 1-3 mph slower over a full day of driving can add up. Today I have 10 minutes to spare if I want to pick up my next load and get home. 

If it is taking a LONG time for the truck to pass and you are getting frustrated be mad at the guy in the right lane. If another semi catches up to me they have demonstrated that the are constantly faster than me. In that case it is an unwritten rule among drivers that the truck in the right lane should slow down a couple of miles per hour so that traffic isn’t impeded.

__Kshz__,Missed Opportunity?,2,1bwthdv,0,"So I (23M) is a new international student at a big US school, who's been here almost 3 months. So far, I've struggled with my mental health since the move, mostly fueled by loneliness and struggling to fit in and be likeable, as an introvert.
Just yesterday, I deactivated most my socials as a means of detoxing, and started researching ways to effectively work on myself, especially during my downtimes. One thing I came up with, which I didn't really do before, was to start writing.
So this morning, I just started describing my perfect woman, the clichéd ""one"", if I may call it so. Owing to personal preferences, this is the gist of what I came up with:
""Redhead, tall (at least 5'10), attractive but not in the usual ways (focus on eyes and the smile for me). Wears glasses, maybe has a hidden tattoo. Also the kind of outgoing personality where she casually flirts with guys in grocery store aisles""
All in all, I was making a character sketch, pretty raw but had more details than what I've written here. Turns out women like these probably do exist somewhere, but I likely would never be laying eyes on one.

UNTIL A FEW HOURS LATER, I DID!

Apart from the glasses, pretty much what I'd described appearance wise. I was in a common uni seating area, attending an online class, and she came in and sat opposite me. She was busy on her laptop too, and so was I, so any conversation seemed out of the question (am excuse for my awkwardness and shyness, perhaps, but we carry on). Still, trust me, I had fallen for her. Instantly.
We sat across from each other for maybe an hour (could've been 2 hours, 3, 15, I wouldn't have known), and there was accidental(?) eye contact at least 3 or 4 times. The best one when a noisy couple came and sat near us, and our eyes silently met as if to say wtf to each other?

I obviously couldn't gauge much about her personality, and she got up and left eventually. I had half a mind to drop everything and follow her, but restrained myself as I didn't wanna be creepy.

And now she's gone. Don't know if I'll ever see her again ;_;

Should I have done or said something? I was considering taking this black ring I wear and ""accidentally"" dropping it near her(I was making a show of taking it on and off, and just playing w it), so she'll maybe pick it up and return it to me. And then I'll say ""yes, I'll marry you!"" which hopefully would have gotten a laugh out of her, and then it'll lead to yada yada with us spending all of eternity together :')

So yeah, opportunity missed? Mentioning again I tend to be awkward and introverted around strangers, though I feel I'm not a bad communicator or talker. If someone starts a convo with me, I usually LOVE it and feel I can hold it well, but I rarely ever start one :'(

And I don't mean just a little jig; I'm talking full-on interpretive dance moves, arms flailing, legs kicking, the whole nine yards. At first, I thought maybe he was rehearsing for a performance or something, but then I realized he was dead serious. What made it even weirder was that he seemed completely oblivious to the fact that there were people all around watching him with a mix of amusement and bewilderment. I couldn't help but chuckle along with everyone else, but man, talk about committing to your own weirdness.",1712285422.0,
_forum_mod,Just felt an Earthquake!,7,1bwjlm5,7,"😲

I live in New Jersey and have never experienced this in my life! I was just sitting at my desk ~~on Reddit~~ working, and my table starts shaking... then the room begins to shake. At first I was like, ""this can't be an Earthquake, that's more of a California thing..."" but turns out it was. It was over quickly. My colleagues all left the rooms and we were all like: ""you felt that?""

I remember a decade ago when I lived in Long Island folks told me there was an Earthquake, but I was sleeping so I didn't experience it. A bit scary, but not too bad. 

Anyone else around this region feel it?",1712327691.0,

Broad-Cranberry-9050,How to deal with difficult co-worker?,5,1bwjccp,4,"

Ive been working at this job for almost 3 years. Recently ive considered whether how much ive loved this job. The area in tech i work in is interesting but its definetely not something i find passionate. Recently ive been considering how long i want to stay here. The pay is amazing, benefits are even better and the work is remote but the work can be alot. The dynamic of the company is to work 10+ hours it feels like. My mentor complains that the project is difficult and they dont do a good job helping newer and younger employees. At times i have difficulty keeping up. 

What’s worse one worker who has been there for years, and probably the smartest person I’ve ever worked with can be very difficult. The dynamic of the team from when i got there was this guy basically knows everything and everyone goes to him for questions. He is very smart but what makes him difficult is he can get pretty stern and combatitive the way my manager puts it he has a vision and expects others to follow it and when they dont he gets annoyed. He is very my way or the highway even for little things. He does give credit where credit is due but when he’a annoyed he will speak in a stern voice, the company promotes a non screaming culture so i can tell he is really holding it in. But when he cant he will make passive aggressive comments. 

Like one time i was presenting my screen in a latge document with many paragraphs and he made a comment about one of the paragraphs. I couldnt see the paragraph he was referring to so i asked where the paragraph was and his response was, “on your screen”. I mentioned something like this to my mentor and i could tell my mentor has had runins similsr to this with him as well. 

Even without this guy ive been debating how long i want to stay. His difficulty feels like icing on the cake for me. Im not sure if this is just a rough patch so im not giving up but ill admit ive refreshed my resume recently. If i do decide to stick it outnfor years i know im going to have to learn how to work with this guy. He is basically at the center of alot of things in this project so avoiding him is almost impossible and i do understand its part of life to work with difficult people. He’s not the first difficult person ive worked with, just the first ive had issues getting on the same page with (i think remote has something to do with it).

Basic_Fix_4868,"Sick of reddit users ""not being helpful""",0,1bwsssf,14,"Warning!

With this I'm not saying those people who I asked for suggestions were bad people who said wrong things.

I'll start with saying I usually never use reddit about my social life and interactions with people, a few times I did use reddit about how to talk with people but not asking them ""what should I say to them?""

Because I already knew what to say, the issue was ""how"" to say it.

However what I used reddit more was to ask about tips how to draw and learn to do so.
I know the general concepts that are classic like obviously using paper and pencil or how to use a graphic tablet.

The real issue is no one, and I mean NO ONE will actually tell you were to start.
At least from my experience they never did.

They would say ""practice and don't beat yourself down, you will improve with time"" which is a good thing to say but relatively speaking...
It's useless.

What can I practice if I don't even know what I have to practice?
Copying a pose reference isn't practicing for example, it's just copying.
That won't teach me to draw eyes, hands, feet, legs etc. of a body and that's what kinda bothers me.
Am I supposed to start from the learning of drawing shapes? Shadows? What should I practice?

Of course I appreciate the never getting discouraged and to keep practice but that is the standard basic of knowledge about everything, not just drawing.
People will tell you to do that but for some reasons will never tell you where to start or what practice with, as if they ignore the fact the person is completely inexperienced in drawing.

As mentioned before I don't think what they said is wrong, but if I just needed words of encouragement and someone to believe in me I wouldn't have asked reddit to begin with because while appreciated there are already people who do that for me.
I actually need the basis of practice, not words of encouragement and to never give up my dream.",1712350423.0,
