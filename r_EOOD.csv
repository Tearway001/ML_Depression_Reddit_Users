rob_cornelius,"""Finding ourselves"" through exercise.",13,1c4iczp,8,"Life in the 21st century is tough, even if you live in the Global North. The 24 hour news cycle is full of doom and gloom from environmental breakdown to economic crisis, even genocide. Its very easy to get lost in all the bad things happening throughout the world and let it drag you down a very steep spiral of anxiety and depression. We lose sight of ourselves and our friends and family. Everything feels simultaneously at a distance and uncomfortably close.

You can read any number of books and watch movies about people rediscovering themselves. If you want a movie recommendation then [Wild](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2305051/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_wild) is great and [The Salt Path](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7856a945-46d0-4960-a7a2-80a8dcc74de1) is a good book. In both of these and many other stories the heroine (in both these recommendations) embarks on a long distance walk that takes months to complete and reconnects with herself, the people she meets and nature along the way. It is a plot device as old as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey.

You don't have to quit everything and walk a thousand miles to see the same results. You achieve the same in the gym, your neighbourhood or even the comfort of your own home. By exercising regularly you take time away from the stresses of the world. You are doing something for your benefit and yours alone. You shape yourself both physically and mentally. 

Regular exercise makes us a better person. We have better self-control, more determination, discipline and dedication. We can *cope* with problems more easily because of that. By quieting our own mental health problems we can listen to what is going on in the world around us without becoming *overwhelmed* and spiralling down. We find ourselves and find our relationships with the rest of the world.

Sadly writing a book about doing yoga with Adrienne in your living room isn't going to land you a 7 figure advance with movie rights optioned separately. If there was any justice in the world then it would. You have done as much as anyone else to find yourself again. You have made yourself a better person.

squirrelexterminator,anxiety during exercise,12,1c3pvb0,4,"hi all, apologies if this has been discussed before (i'm sure it has), i tried searching for it but couldn't quite find what i was looking for.

i find that i get anxiety during moderate-high intensity exercise and i wanted to see if anybody else has heard of this/struggles with it. growing up i was into lots of sports and was quite good at them, it was fun for me - this was never an issue for me until probably my mid-teenage years when i began exercising less frequently. now it has gotten to the point where even though i want to exercise, i'm anxious before even starting because i'm worried i will feel anxious/sick while working out. it's worth noting that a lot of my anxiety is rooted in a fear of throwing up so one of my biggest concerns before exercise is exerting myself too much to the point that i feel like i'm going to throw up. during exercise, if i'm going at a high enough intensity, i find the heavy breathing/increased heart rate freaks me out a little bit and i feel anxious, especially from the feeling of not being able to catch my breath. the only exercise i can regularly do without anxiety is i play tennis weekly but in a group of up to 8 people (which means more breaks, less exertion).

does anyone know a) what the cause of this could be? its hard for me to know whether this is all caused by my anxiety or whether the exercise causes the anxiety.. if that makes sense

b) does anyone have any ideas on how i can stop feeling this way? i'm sure getting a little more in shape would help, however the prospect of that terrifies me because i know in order to get there i need to exercise haha

i really want to be able to go on runs again and not feel like my body and brain are going to fail me. any tips/advice/insights are greatly appreciated!",1713088117.0,

YongRice,I started working out and I've never felt worse mentally.,32,1c0xq8w,12,"Like a lot of people I started this year promising I'd go to the gym consistently, and I have. I have work most of the week and I'm a full time college student, so I usually work out on days I have class. I get a lot of steps and movement in on workdays so I don't do anything intense those days. Ever since I've started this routine, I feel so much worse mentally. I find myself constantly comparing myself to everyone else in the gym, feeling depressed and hopeless because they already have what I so desperately want. Outside of the gym, whenever I see someone small/thin I feel stressed, I feel like I should be working out. Whenever I sit or take a moment to myself, I feel like I'm gaining weight just by sitting there. I can't relax or feel comfortable anymore. I never eat much, but I also cut back on my eating. I eat less than 1200 calories per day. I started just doing cardio, but now I do weight training and cardio. I take progress photos and see no change at all. When I eat I feel terrible, I don't enjoy food like I used to. I just feel like I'm hindering my progress no matter what I eat. I feel so unwell. Has anyone else gone through this?

I know it’s hard taking the first step but let me tell you guys about my experience. I’m pretty sure I drove to the gym about a dozen times before I even walked in there. I would drive there at all types of hoursand anxiety started to kick in. I would sit in my truck for 30 40,50 min even an hour. Until one day, I went to the gym during the time where it was practically empty 2 AM where I live. Four weeks I had been saving up Instagram videos on workouts I would have a collection of say, “gym bicep”, another one of “Gym shoulders” another one of “gym back” etc etc. first day I went, was only a handful of people hit the treadmill to warm up and went over the gym exercises that I would do for that day, and even if I forgot, I would just go back and look at the videos. I just started to work out, more people started coming in and I just kept doing my workouts. Nobody cares at all, nobody is looking at you, nobody is judging you. Just walk in there and start to do your workouts. I know I don’t have perfect form or do my workouts perfectly but I’m in there trying!

rob_cornelius,"Behaving ""as if"" you are not mentally ill",17,1c0lrda,13,"I saw an excellent TV show by the wildlife presenter Chris Packham on Autism called [Inside Our Autistic Minds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0bbnjvx) a while ago. (You will need a VPN that has a UK endpoint to watch it from abroad.) Its a wonderful TV show and I really recommend it. Chris is Autistic himself and the show is incredibly well made and makes important points without preaching.

One of the people in the show and Chris himself talked about ""masking"". This is where an autistic person works out how a neurotypical person would behave in a situation and tries to behave in the same way. They behave *as if* they are neurotypical. Some autistic people can become so good at this that no one realises they are essentially like someone acting a part in a play or movie for pretty much their entire life.

Then I read something the other day. It was [an interview](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/08/patric-gagne-sociopath-fighting-urges) with a woman who has a diagnosis of being a sociopath or as its otherwise know antisocial behaviour disorder. She says that ""I would try to figure out the socially appropriate way to respond"" which to my my way of thinking very, very similar to a neurodivergent person ""masking"". 

Then last night I was reading a book on ethics. The author said it is very difficult to teach yourself to behave ethically where ever possible. They said it is very easy to behave *as if* you are an ethical person and that is perfectly ok.

Can you see a pattern here? I can.

I think CBT / DBT and other BT type therapies teach us to behave *as if* we are not mentally ill to some extent. We learn to recognise behaviours and thought patterns that are ""not correct"" and to adapt to not fall into those bear traps. We work out what how we should think and behave and behave *as if* that was how we would behave ""normally"". Eventually in time we behave and think ""normally"" without the step of thinking *as if* we are ""normal"".

Perhaps exercise can help with this us who are neurotypical. Its ""normal"" to try to look after yourself. To get some exercise and try to eat well etc. Perhaps exercise helps us to behave *as if* we are ""normal"". Eventually we become ""normal"". What ever being normal actually means anyway.

Of course the big difference is that a person who is neurodivergent is stuck in the *as if* / masking stage. Its very, very difficult indeed to behave ""normally"" as their mind is not made from quite the same mould as ""normal"". It must be exhausting to have to do that every waking moment of the day. Even so I think that it might be helpful to use exercise as part of a ""masking"" activity. I would think it is easy to pretend to behave how someone behaves when exercising hard. If I am making a sweeping generalisation here tell me differently and try to excuse my ignorance.",1712756174.0,

LowIQ-Genius,About to turn 40 and facing crushing depression over life mistakes and unrealized ambition. I hope exercise saves me.,60,1bzz011,19,"Soon to be 40m. I have suffered from anxiety for a very long time, my whole life I suppose. Always thought I was immune to depression as I have been an energetic and passionate person with many interests. Then this winter I began to experience lots of fatigue and negative feelings, and rapid disinterest in being productive. I thought it was my health, but have been getting a clean bill of health from every doctor I have seen.

Then this week I began thinking more about turning 40 and I can't stop crying over a feeling of loss. Loss of time squandered and opportunities missed. I have a wife and kids, and I have been running my own business for 10 years now. I feel like there are some good outcomes, but my level of ambition and the potential everyone always told me I had in my life has never been realized. I have made so many mistakes, wasted so much time with laziness and distractions a plenty, and I find myself in sort of a hamster wheel now related to finances and responsibility that has no end in sight. I feel like I blew it to be honest. Things could be so different.

I am neglecting my business and clients for a month now and I just feel an infinite well of painful emotion underneath it all. In the last 24 hours I realized I am clearly depressed. It is a horrible feeling and I want to get out of this hole and return to being productive.

I immediately thought of one of the genuine mood boosters of my life, and realized exercise has always had the best outcomes for me, even if I have never been consistent. I remember times where my mood lifted as a result of aerobic exercise to almost euphoria levels. That is how I found this reddit, thinking of something I could do soon to help myself.

I feel like I can't control anything right now, except maybe my health. In recent years I have been my heaviest ever, and in rapid decline physically. So I can't help but suspect it is part of everything I am feeling. A symptom and a cause feeding itself.

I guess I am just here looking for hope. I am so scared about how I feel, like I could lose myself in this sea of despair, and let my family down. After this post I am putting on exercise clothes and going for a run despite the fact that all I want to do is lay in bed and stare at the ceiling.",1712686414.0,

rob_cornelius,Taking what we gain from exercise and applying it to the rest of our lives,24,1byv2e9,2,"Exercising regularly requires a great deal of mental effort alongside the physical effort. Just starting a work out can be a mountain to climb. Doing that regularly takes a great deal of determination, discipline and dedication.

These are qualities that mental health problems steal from us. Its easier to stay in bed and hide than get all hot and sweaty even if we know getting hot and sweaty will make us feel better than staying in bed.

I find that when I work out the rest of my day goes a little better. I normally exercise as soon as I get out of bed in the morning so that leaves a full day to feel a little better. Problems with code, people and things seem just that little bit easier after a work out. I can say to myself ""You got up and got on your rowing machine this morning. Stop procrastinating and see what happens when you run your code"". I am that little bit more focussed and determined to do *anything* for the rest of the day.

Manus_2,"Since late 2022, I've managed to lose 60 pounds.",29,1bukx6j,2,"I started at 240 pounds, but experiencing my first seizure and Covid within the same week as my birthday, was altogether what initially got the ball rolling for me. Fast forward to now, and I'm currently 182 pounds (so technically I've only lost 58 pounds, but whatever), and nearing my goal of being 170 pounds. Although, I might try to go a little lower if I can, in regards to 165 or even 160. My life is still a phantasmagorical nightmare, and probably always will be, but at least I've managed to do this much. Here's hoping I can also manage to keep it off for good, insofar as the rest of my life is concerned. The threat of potentially experiencing another seizure if I ever let myself go to the same extent as before I started, will itself definitely help to keep me on the right track, but again, I just hope that's enough. 

For all intents and purposes, my existence on this planet is over and I'm just waiting for death, but unlike weight loss, this is something that can't be helped. For those that are curious, I'm an agoraphobic hermit who's rotted away indoors for 15+ years. Life ended for me a long time ago, although it'd be more accurate to say it never really began in the first place. 

That being said, let me save everyone some time here and indicate what should be blazingly obvious. There's absolutely **nothing** anyone can think to say that I haven't heard a thousand times before, and sorry to burst your bubble, but some fundamentally limp/meaningless words on a screen **are not** going to be the thing that finally turns my existence around for the better. Just like with weight loss, there wasn't anything that anyone could've said to make doing it seem any less impossible. Either the necessary corrective experience occurs, or it doesn't. I didn't foresee nor plan on experiencing a seizure, nor did I plan or foresee on getting Covid immediately afterwards. Those things just happened, and I reacted to them. One could lament what a tragic limitation it is, when it comes to a great many people, wherein change tends to only take place reactively, instead of proactively, but that's just how it is, and here I sit in the much less enviable position of those two camps. 

Corrective experiences are all well and good for things like weight loss, but when it comes to resolving and compartmentalizing an entire lifetime spent crushed beneath an avalanche of extreme isolation and severe trauma, you're talking about a pile of shit that's so monolithically large, that you'd need literal divine intervention to have any chance of surmounting it. Zen Buddhism and getting high on shrooms, or volunteering in some ramshackle shithole, or whatever other glib bullshit people usually think to throw at me when they try (and fail) to wrap their head around a predicament like mine, are altogether about as laughably insufficient and misplaced as it gets. Almost as absurd/insulting as telling a paraplegic that a good jog will help to clear their head. So again, boo hoo, so sad, it is what it is. At least I managed to lose some weight, and make my interim to the grave slightly less uncomfortable. Three cheers for me, somebody release all the colourful confetti already.

meloabreuu,I'm barely hanging on,20,1bu9gn5,15,"I've been working as a personal trainer for a few months. Exercise has kept me afloat during some terrible times. It would be interesting to see how things would be right now if I wasn't exercising alot, because I'm in pretty bad shape mentally. I ran 4.5 miles yesterday morning, and did a 45 minute upper body workout later at night. I tend to overtrain when things get bad. 

I don't know how to establish and maintain relationships of any kind with people. I don't know what I was thinking when I decided to get a training certification. My son is the only thing keeping me alive at the moment. My brother is in a nursing home after almost dying a year ago from issues related to obesity. I live with my son and my dad, who's a terrible father. He raised a food addict and a heroin addict, and we both almost died from our addictions. I don't have the social skills to be anything more than an acquaintance with anyone. The handful of females that have ever been in my life were as fucked up as I am. The first one took her own life(eventually,) and the last one gave me a child that I was 1000% not ready for. I love him with all my heart, but he derailed my life.

I was 9 years old when I wished I was dead for the first time. Most of my 27 years since then have been spent trying to figure out my way through this maze called life, hoping I will find something to hold on to, that will make me glad to be here.

Ok_Suggestions,Feeling sad/depressed after weightlifting sessions recently,13,1bu9jwq,6,"I hope this sub is a good fit for this question. 

So, i love going to the gym and lifting weights. I do it about 3-4 times a week, for about 1 1/2 hours each session. I'm going to muscular failure on the last set of each exercise. I feel like mentioning these numbers might help with finding an answer.  


So how it used to be was that i worked out and felt great afterwards - activated sort of, or motivated. it energized me and i was keen to do even more productive things afterwards, such as cleaning up or similar chores.

But i've noticed that this has changed. Recently, when i'm done with my workout, i'm feeling sort of like in a state of depression. It starts out towards the end of my sessions already and it fades relatively quickly after about 2 hours. Working out has went from empowering me and brightening my  mood, to dragging me down afterwards. A little bit like a comedown off of a drug. But i don't feel a particular rush during working out, i would say. I mean i love it and after every workout i feel quite confident with the pump and all, but the lowered mood is very much bothering me, especially in a morale-kind of way. Like, of course i want working out to be a positive thing as a whole. Right now i still really really enjoy it, but always have to have room to recollect first afterwards. I also feel like at the time when workouts felt empowering was when i had trouble motivating myself otherwise, which is not as much of an issue today...well except recently i've been quite overwhelmed with stress overall but this shift in after-workout-mood is something i feel started earlier.

So what's going on here?

To me it feels hormonal. I'm not sure why exactly i think that, it's just that i know what depression feels like and that is sort of how i feel afterwards. Just lightly, but enough to have it bother me. I feel it is influenced by me eating - as in, eating after working out, gets rid of the moodiness more quickly. But who knows, maybe i'm completely wrong. I'm trying to analyze the differences between back then and now. The first thing that comes to mind is that i started logging my sets and reps again since roughly middle of last year. I used to not do that anymore. So, i used to do it, but it put immense pressure on me that made working out really not fun anymore. Then covid hit, gyms closed and when they reopened i started again, but without logging and it was wonderful (man i'm starting to feel like i'm already giving an obvious answer to my own question here). People encouraged me to start keeping notes of my workouts again but i was afraid i'd fall back into feeling this pressure that made me lose interest in working out. After a while though, i did start logging again and it was actually really great. It is what enabled me to push myself and actually check whether or not i was making progress. I would also say that that is when i starting doing more sets to muscular failure.

So in short - i take my workouts more seriously and probably push myself a lot harder nowadays. I really struggle with not pushing myself. There's been several occassions where i told myself i'm gonna take it slow for a session, leave a couple reps in the tank for each set. But i don't. I just need to feel like i'm doing what i need to to enable growth. So there's an obvious area where i could try things out.

This one time a couple of weeks ago, i was also sick with a cold, so i wasn't working out. Surprisingly, i felt a lot less stressed after not working out for a good week and a half. 

So where i'm at right now: Working out is great but afterwards i don't feel well mentally. I feel like it could be hormonally but there's also quite a few changes i've implemented ever since workouts used to feel empowering afterwards. I don't know, what's the best course of action here? Well okay, that might not be the top priority question here, because taking it slower or running some tests maybe are some methods i can see. I guess my main interest is whether or not this sounds familiar to anyone or conclusive and if anyone has any clue what might be going on here.

Thanks in advance. Sorry for this post being a bit messy. There's so many more things i could say about my situation that are surely relevant in one way or another but the easiest approach here might be gathering ideas first anyway and providing additional info as needed.",1712090868.0,

Last fall I did the couch to 5k program for the first time and enjoyed it a lot, so now that the weather is warm enough again but not too hot yet, I am doing it again, starting from the beginning of the program.

I am using the Couch to 5k app by the makers of Zombies Run, so I am Runner 5 again! This is an 8 week program, with three workouts per week, and the last workout is a 5k nonstop run.

This week the workouts consist of: 10 minute brisk walk, then running drills of (1 minute walk followed by 15 second run) repeated 10 times, then 10 minutes of free form running - I ran all 10 minutes but my speed was not really faster than walking speed this time but that’s ok! And finally I finished walking home. All this took me 40 minutes today, but only about 12 minutes of that was running, over the weeks this will build up to more and more running.

It was fun, though I am out of shape again, so slow and steady it is. The weather was perfect for this today here in Virginia USA - temperature of 66 degrees Fahrenheit, with partly cloudy and some sunshine.

ni_Xi,Body gradually taking away from me everything I used to like,17,1brgmmd,13,"Hey guys, I’m 26 yo and have been in anxiety and occassional depression loop for already three years. Long story short - dad committed suicide, chronic stress developed into anxiety disorder and am half a year after major surgery. I visit therapy regularly which is very helpful and am on no meds and as I’m afraid of sexual side effects (+ keep them as the last resort for if the shit really hits the fan)

Excercising has always been there for me. I used to jog a lot and used to go to gym occassionally. The endorphin wave afterwards got me through the worst times. Unfortunately I feel like I am trapped in a body of 60yo. I have IBS treated by meds but exercise always helped the symptoms. Then I developed acid reflux making every kind of exercise pretty uncomoftable due to the acid going up my throat. I can basically exercise now only on an empty stomach. Then my knees decided that theres gonna be no more jogging. Basically I have something naturally wrong with kneecap and cant even hike without pain anymore so no more mountains, great. Now I am afraid my workout routine is gonna get fucked up too as I have arm joints pain while exercising. As I’m in therapy I already have coping mechanisms helping me but sometimes I just fucking hate this body of mine taking away one by one great things from me at such a young age. I also have ganglion preventing me from playing my favorite sport - badminton.

Feeling really low today so I guess I just wanted to rant as I dont really confide in anyone because they dont get it. I have very big self esteem issues due to my childhood and my body gradually falling apart is not really doing me any favour in this matter. I will schedule an appointment with my doctor as I’m also a suspect for having crohns now.

Exercise isn't a dopamine pill.  At best, it aids serotonin - calm.  So if you're expecting Lift Weight, Receive Reward, it's not going to happen.

Years ago, I had one SSRI that \*seemed\* to make a difference.  The stress and anxiety were still there, but they felt \*farther away\*.  And thus, easier to manage.

If your life sucks, yeah, it's STILL going to suck.  But decent depression/anxiety/stress management makes it so, well, it stops being such a big deal.  Just slightly less on the edge of collapse.  That \*thing\* that would usually keep you up at night doesn't.  That \*thing\* that might bother you and ruin your mood just kind of bounces off you.

A slightly higher BS buffer.  The manic gerbil that would normally stress out will shrug and say ""Eh, whatever"" rather than hopping on the stresswheel.

Bitter-Gap8687,Update: Sports and exercise aren't really helping.,21,1bo7j32,8,"I don't know, its been a few months since I made my other post here so I wanted to make an update. 

So lets start with the not so good. Unfortunately, I still don't enjoy or gain any mental health benefits from pure exercise like weightlifting, running, cycling or exercises of that nature. For a while, I really did try and change my attitude towards it because I thought ""well maybe you're just expecting it to feel bad and maybe thats why it feels bad"" but nope, its just not fun for me. I realized this pretty recently because I got sick a week ago and had to stay at home so I played a game I originally didn't like but gave it another chance and ended up greatly enjoying it. And while I was playing, I suddenly thought to myself ""Wow, this is really good, I'm having a lot of fun playing this!"" But then I also thought ""Wow, I've literally NEVER experienced this exercising"" which is a bit sad but it is true. I have, however, made some semblance of peace with it. It doesn't feel good but at least I've gotten used to it enough that it doesn't feel bad.

Next, I quit ultimate. I just don't have to time for it and rugby and for a side sport to play occasionally I enjoy soccer more because I'm more familar with it.

Rugby is going very well. I made a solid effort to improve my attitude toward my mistakes and keep going despite them and I think I've seen some success. I did finally get a position, it is flanker! Although sometimes I feel more like a failed prop than a flanker. I have played in 3 games now (for less than 20 min each lol) and was able to secure several rucks, make tackles and even cause a turnover by jackaling. I am no longer the slowest person on the team and while my cardio is still awful, its better than it used to be. I'm making a serious effort to improve my cardio but its slooooooooooowwwww.

Something I find a bit ironic is that, 3 months ago I thought that another new person on the team was liked more because she was better at the game than me and if I was better they would like me more as well. But instead it wasn't any improvement in rugby that made me more accepted, it was my enjoyment of video games and computer skills that did. I did a few things for them in photoshop and python and the nerdy players and I talk about games regularly now. I also feel more accepted by the less nerdy players too. We had a game on Saturday and I was asking some questions and the player I was talking to gave me a genuine smile talking to me pointing out something that was happening. This is one of the only times in my life I've felt accepted by a group. I can definitely say I enjoy playing and I enjoy being around my teammates so I consider that a massive improvement from 3 months ago. 

So while I didn't get what I wanted from the gym, I made solid strides in other areas and sometimes for reasons I didn't expect. And thank you everyone who gave advice in the last post.",1711458645.0,
thalmor_egg,Dealing with recovering from injury,5,1boj6xy,3,"Hey guys, sorry for the rambling but I guess it helps to put some thoughts on paper. It's been a week since I pulled my triceps kickboxing after going pretty much every day and I'm slowly getting used to being less active while I heal. My work is really hectic (minimum 10 hours every day) so kickboxing was pretty  much the only thing keeping me in check after I finish work. I've made so much improvement and stagnating worries me. I'm generally very anxious so my mind is going crazy with all possible worst case scenarios and worries, OCD and hypochondria. Training is the only place where I feel free from all these intrusive thoughts so it's even more frustrating when I get home from work and just have to deal with shit hahah. On a more positive note, I try and keep myself busy with other things and obligations that I need to finish, but I can't seem to find any pleasurable activities to keep me happy that aren't exercising. I'm avoiding alcohol and going out so socializing isn't  something that would help me much and I'm content just doing my own thing. My first idea is to start running actively to keep my stamina up - it's not as high intensity but I enjoy it nonetheless. The dumbest part about this triceps injury is that I'm very scared of hitting again and fucking something else up. Thanks for any tips!

But some some reason around august-sep last year, I had symptoms rapidly come on, without any real external stressor to bring it on. 

I started to notice exercise, even just walking, was bringing on feelings of depression, anxiety, irritability, and also feelings of lightheadedness, and it is also aggravating an IBS like condition in me. 

If I stop exercising, including walking significant distances, the symptoms calm themselves down, although not completely. 

I don't understand why my body would suddenly feel so under stress while even just walking. If I were to go on a 5 mile walk right now, I would not feel tired afterwards, but I would feel depressed for a couple of days after, I would also get horrible feelings of tightness around my body, testicular, ribs and abs. I'd also get bad farts.

It's just bringing on all the symptoms of bad anxiety/stress, but I don't even feel stressed.

So treat exercise as a job, one that occasionally pays you in happy brain chemicals. Just turn up, exercise and go home. You don't do it for any other reason apart from ""I need to do this to help me with my mental health issues"". Then when the happy brain chemicals kick in treat them as an unexpected bonus or raise.

The more exercise I do, the worse I feel. I don't understand why this is. I've gone for all sorts of tests to rule out medical conditions. I've used BGM's to track blood sugar, I've had blood/stool sample tests to try and test for food allergies and deficiencies and nothing conclusive is coming back.

JoannaBe,On the importance of improving mindfulness and self awareness,3,1bfun1m,1,"We have all heard that mindfulness and self awareness can be very helpful with mental health.

This evening I was reminded of an example from a book I once read “The Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep” by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche. In this example from the book, a man walks down a street after work, not paying conscious attention to what is happening around him. He notices in passing a couple arguing, and this reminds him of how bothered he was whenever his parents argued when he was a child. But he does not consciously notice the couple arguing, and he does not really pay attention to his related memory and emotional reaction. He goes home, has dinner with his wife, and after a while he goes to bed. This night he dreams that he and his wife are arguing. Upon waking up he does not remember his dream. But he is now aware that he is angry with his wife but does not know why.

This kind of thing can happen to all of us. Just because we do not remember a dream or nightmare does not mean that it cannot affect our waking mood. How to improve dream recall is a learnable skill, and it can help us understand our thoughts and emotions better.

Mindfulness, paying attention to what is happening in the present moment, what is happening around us, and inside of our mind, can help us catch situations where something random we overhear or see may trigger a reaction in us such as this man’s memory of his parents fighting for example.

Self awareness could help us realize sooner why we get upset, understand our triggers, cause and effect. And with increased understanding we may be able to correct course or let go.

An example of this practice from my own life (and I am not always as good at this as I was that time of course): I once sent an angry email to our neighborhood listserv. After sending the email I had planned to go do the dishes. Instead I found myself in fetal position on the couch, not doing dishes. My self assessment told me that something was wrong, so I thought back to what caused it. It was of course easy to deduce that it may have to do with the angry email I sent, but why was it upsetting me so much - it was not even that important an issue? 

Then I realized that what really bothered me was not so much what I read and wrote, but what I thought while I was writing the email: in my thoughts I had added “You idiots!” Even though I did not actually write it and it was just a passing thought in anger (an anger that was out of proportion to the issue that was subject of the email), but this thought brought back the memory of how painful it was whenever my father called me an idiot when I was growing up. And so my thought backfired on me, and I was in fetal position on the couch because I regretted thinking that about others, blamed myself for it, and blamed my father for calling me that. I had to forgive myself, and let go of the anger, and remind myself that I could improve my reactions in the future. And only then could I get up and go to the kitchen to do the dishes.",1710553310.0,
miss_little_lady,RD made comment and I'm struggling with it now ,6,1bfq54m,9,"I recently started seeing a registered dietitian (RD) again, after years of not seeing one. My main goals are to lose weight and return to a vegan diet. I moved states last year and have been struggling to maintain my veganism, opting for more vegetarian items when eating out. I made this quite clear at the start of my session.

When discussing easy breakfast options, I mentioned recently enjoying a yogurt parfait with melon rather than berries. I was excited when she gave the thumbs up for this. Later in the session, my RD discussed ways to ensure I was getting my necessary protein. She listed off items to buy, including whole milk greek yogurt. I reminded her that I tried my best to be vegan whenever possible. She then asked/stated ""so you don't do any dairy?"" I said, I don't actively purchase those items, but when I eat out, I tend to eat it when there's no other options. She then said ""I hope you aren't getting that So Delicious coconut stuff because if you are then it doesn't even matter."" This comment has really been bugging me over the last week. It felt so condescending and unhelpful. I get it may have less protein and more sugar than greek yogurt. But surely it's better than grabbing fast food for breakfast? I'm still getting the benefit of fruit in the parfait and offered to add almond slices to my granola. 

I guess I'm just looking for a space to vent and make seek some guidance on how to not let this comment get to me. I want to change my eating habits but really do need some extra help from a RD right now. ",1710540979.0,

rob_cornelius,"""Forcing"" yourself to exercise",13,1bcx3x3,4,"When I read back through older posts I see this phrase or similar ones used regularly.

Exercise can seem to be a chore. Something we have to do whether we like it or not. Its something we ""must"" do. I think this mindset means it is actually less likely that we exercise.

By making exercise a chore it means we have to invest a great deal of mental effort just to start. The more effort it takes the less likely we are to summon up the self-discipline, dedication and determination required to start.

A few years ago my t'ai chi teacher would tell us when we were struggling with a certain movement that we shouldn't think about it. Instead we should just let it happen. The more we wobbled whilst standing on one leg and kicking with the other leg, keeping our torsos from leaning and moving both arms all at the same time the worse we got at it. We tried to force our bodies to move fluidly, gracefully and elegantly and ended up looking like drunken apes wobbling and flailing around and even falling over.

Of course its impossible to do that complex movement and be perfect from the start. It takes a lot of practice. Repetition after repetition over weeks and even longer. Eventually I could do the kick and move just as gracefully and elegantly as its possible for a large muscular guy to manage. My overall balance and coordination improved in order to do that.

Just letting exercise happen as something you just do is not easy. It also requires a hell of a lot practice when you are not very good at it. Eventually your discipline, dedication and determination kick in and you exercise in the same way as you getting dressed in the morning. It just happens

Until you get to that point try not to see exercise as a chore. Its not something you do because you have to. Each time you exercise you are celebrating what your body and your mind are capable of. Who wouldn't want to exercise when you are celebrating a victory?",1710249686.0,

Scared_Fish_7069,Day 1 of brisk walking for 20 minutes,16,1b9jk47,2,"I‘d like to share that I’ve done the first day of the challenge today. It was really hard to get started. I planned to go since 10am but I got out of the house at 3:30pm and didn’t brisk walk until 3:50pm. I also definitely did a slower pace at some time. Instead of the gym, I walked outside as it was windy today and my brother was going outside anyways (I feel more energized to go outside if someone else is going out as well).

What I did today, my findings, and the pros and cons of this experience:

* I meditated for 5 minutes before walking
* Bought a Venti Latte first before brisk walking
* Drank the Venti Latte while walking
* Halfway on the time I brisk walked inside a mall
* I climbed some stairs inside the mall and people definitely looked at me like I’m some kind of psycho
* My mood is boosted, but I don’t know if it’s the caffeine or workout
* I definitely prefer straw to lid for drinks since it keeps my ADHD body in check by doing something mindless (sipping on a drink)
* Rewards weren’t really the thing that MADE me start walking, nor was it mindless distractions or activities. Idk. I think for me it was the idea that this could be fun? Or thinking “fuck it, I’ll do it” and keeping an open mind to any outcomes of this experiment?

Psychological effects (note: idk if these are effects from the caffeine, workout, or meditation):

* It feels “freeing” to have this much stamina
* I don’t care much about other people’s judgements or thoughts
* I can judge and reason with things better
* I feel more daring and take more risks

Pros:

* It feels “freeing”, like my body is “free” from a deep, long physical
* Potentially a way to cure depression
* It’s so fun to use adrenaline from coffee to produce more adrenaline
* After I finish it feels like I just had a long, deep, satisfying nap

Cons:

I’ll have to find a way to get rid of the cons

* Progress might halt if rewards are limited (money/time limitations)
* Gotta wash my hair even when all I did was brisk walk for 20 minutes. I’m a girl and washing my hair every day would suck and damage my scalp, so I’ll have to find ways to not smell bad on days where I don’t wash my hair.
* Takes a LOT of energy and mental preparation to get my foot on the door. Like psyching myself up. I’ll be honest this is the worst part of the experience and it’s like hell on earth
* Sore legs
* Working out inside buildings is inconvenient because the AC gives me a headache when I'm working out. Working out outside is inconvenient when it's hot and there's no breeze at all. I'll need to find a balance or a compromise that I'm willing to do

Next experiments:

* Every 5 days, I buy myself a small merch of my favorite animes and other trinkets from Bandai Gachapon (vending machines that give out capsule toys)
* Using green tea/matcha instead of coffee (money-saving)
* Planning out my routes using Google Maps to fit exactly 20 minutes (because the same route would turn boring)

Well, no.  Not directly.

I find exercise tires out the manic gerbil in my brain that's looking for things to stress out about.

As well, I feel satisfaction from the ability, the *skill* in moving inanimate objects.  I use such a comical reduction on purpose.  I can move an implement overhead!  Okay, next week I do that one more time.  The next week, I move an implement overhead that's slightly heavier.

That's it.  That's progressive overload.

Those that convert to becoming a gymrat can get addicted pretty easily.  Not sure whether I have an addictive personality, or getting better at something is addictive.

Pizza.

That's a non-contraversial enjoyable activity for most people.  We like eating pizza.  We could eat pizza every day if we wanted.  But, eating it every day has diminished returns of enjoyment.

I lead my ""week"" with deadlift day, as it's both the most taxing, and something I really enjoy.  I *always* look forward to it.  I have to argue with myself to take a rest day prior to deadz.

Next-Breakfast9586,Exercising and OCD,12,1b87ku3,8,"Hi,

I’m really, really desperate to get back into exercise and reduce my sugar intake. My main issue is, my mental health has suffered a lot in the past 1.5 years due to burnout and severe depression from being overworked. Before I had the job that burnt me out to the point of being sui*idal, I was an avid exerciser. But my relationship to it was generally unhealthy. Historically, I’ve used it as a coping mechanism to deal with intense amounts of stress, anxiety, and frustration, and exercise (and dieting, but that’s for another time) became obsessions for me. I would exercise compulsively to the point of not sleeping at night so I’d have more time to workout, and using any inch of free time I had to find more ways to exercise. My body was lean and fit to the objective observer but I was certainly sick in my old world of dieting constantly and exercising consistently. The job I had was also incredibly physical, so while I exercised less (due to exhaustion), my body still remained basically the same. 

Now I have a desk job and struggle constantly with chronic stress and get tired/overwhelmed easily after burning out and have stopped exercising completely for a little over a year now. I keep trying and trying to get started back up on a routine, but after the longest break from exercising I’ve ever taken in my life it feels damn near impossible to find a routine again, especially bc I work most of the day and have so many other obligations and responsibilities to attend to outside of work. It feels like there’s no time, and on top of that I feel like I don’t even have the same drive I used to. I had a very all or nothing mindset and in my attempts to get back into it I keep trying to ease back into it and keep lowkey pushing myself too hard too fast or moving so slowly I get bored and can’t stay interested in it. I feel so frustrated, I just want exercise to be part of my life again and idk why it feels so difficult. I’m eating so much more sugar lately as a way to cope and I just feel I don’t even recognize myself anymore, and it saddens me. I’ve had body dysmorphia my entire life and it’s been really bad lately, to the point where I can’t even stand to look at myself for long periods of time without pinching or scrutinizing. I worry immensely that I’m losing that part of myself, and I know the way I engaged with it wasn’t healthy, but it really does help me in many ways. It helps me sleep and emotionally regulate, plus it always helped me feel more confident bc it reminded me that I can do things that are difficult and I struggle a lot with self esteem. Idk, I feel desperate and guilty because the longer I take to get back into working out, the more I worry that I’ll never return to it. If anyone has advice on this, I’d love to hear it.

kevzilla88,On Confidence,11,1b87oex,5,"One of the biggest issues I am still struggling with, and one that I see others often struggle with here, is an issue with confidence. Whether it is not feeling confident enough to go to the gym, or general lack of confidence that colors everything in a negative light, lacking it makes everything worse and very often in my case, leads to feelings of imposter syndrome.

What's helped me make progress is the realization that, as confidence comes from within, one of the biggest issues is that we are not critical of our own perceptions. All to often, when we get positive feedback we downplay it and only focus on the negative. Much like a propagandist, our minds create our our own lack of confidence and then emphatically insist this is the factual truth.

Take the example of the person who is politically the opposite side to you. How easy is it to see all their biases and mistakes? But if you ask them, they will insist they are being objective and factual. This is much like your mind.

So what do you do? What has helped me is to just try to notice this bias. Noticing is the first step to fixing.

**Noticing**

Think about a ""positive"" thing in your life. Then notice that you will instinctually add a ""but..."".

Personal examples:

* ""People tell me I have an impressive body.... but those people aren't pros so their opinion is less valuable""
* ""I spent thousands of hours reading hundreds of research papers to come to my conclusions regarding the science of muscle hypertrophy... but this person who has more social standing/results disagrees so I must be wrong""

Then think about a negative thing in your life... and notice there is no ""but...""

* ""I am prone to vanity.""
* ""I am impulsive.""
* ""I make mistakes.""
* ""Nobody wants to listen to my thoughts and opinions""

Our minds just take such negativity at face value and doesn't even question it.

Even look through posts on here and other mental health support groups. If the person talks about a positive train, its almost always followed by a ""but"" and negative traits almost never do. This thinking then shapes your view of the world and leads to a cycle of negativity.

The way to gain confidence, therefore, is simple (but definitely not easy):

**The way to gain confidence is to stop sabotaging your confidence.**

FYI in case it matters in context I am a relatively muscular individual who is also fairly fat (enough that you might not know I lift, 5'9 (M) and 300lbs) and need to lose fat while maintaining muscle, though I understand and accept losing a little muscle if it means losing enough fat to merit it.

If my choice is to do a workout right before bed, or not do the workout at all that day, is it worth it to do the workout. Assume any waiting around to calm down comes right out of sleep time.

Cardio right after weights. This is OFTEN the only time it's gonna happen for me. If I want to do cardio there's no ""moving things around to space it out"". If my goal is fat loss while maintaining some muscle is doing cardio right after the weightlifting good enough?

Ambitious_Repair_877,How to stop the shame spiral when falling off the wagon/ binge eating,8,1b7ner8,4,"Hi guys, I’m new to this community and was just looking for some support from others that have started exercising for mental health reasons. I have cptsd and my therapist recently told me that exercise is the number one thing for people with trauma so the past two weeks I’ve been exercising and doing pretty well (not pressuring myself and not overdoing it to burn myself out). I used to be a dancer and trained for hours daily so I always feel better with exercise in my life, and felt a lot more energetic and generally in a better mood after going. Unfortunately though my old negative coping mechanisms of binge eating is still really hard to not fall into when I’m anxious and over the weekend I binged pretty bad and didn’t go to the gym from feeling guilty. I always feel such shame after but I was wondering if anyone else still struggles or even falls into using an old bad coping mechanism and how they get themselves back to trying the gym, how do you do it on the days you reallyyyyy don’t want to? Or when you feel like you “failed”? I want to keep this as a consistent habit bc in the long run I know I feel a lot better mentally but I know I won’t be able to if I don’t go everytime I “don’t feel like it” lol. ",1709689913.0,
duvethan100,Pain,8,1b7lc1m,5,I’ve been in pain since 2018. I’ve been to several PTs and they gave me exercises but I rarely did them. The pain didnt go away ofc. It made me quit working for 3 years. And I just stayed in bed all day doing nothing. But then I got a job last august and that made me active again. I started working out again and the pain started to ease. Now I feel that my body is mauled by the way I’ve been treating it and I feel so stupid. I cant understand how I didnt do anything to fix it for that long. I dont know if thats just what pain does to you. it has to do with a lot of fear also. Fear of making thing worse if I move my body a certain way. I cant get rid of that fear even now. I fear that if Im not cautious enough I will fuck it up again and I Will continue to live in pain even longer. Life is weird.,1709684257.0,

Like, of course I know that exercise will help with depression. But like… for what? I’m not emotionally invested in terms of wanting to get a better body because I’m a female and I‘m already thin. I have no problems attracting men, to be very honest, and I don’t seek being popular or an instagram model or even having a boyfriend or even sex. So I have no emotional investment to exercise in terms of looks and popularity/being hot. For health? I walk a lot in the sun. For depression that isn’t enough but it sure is for my health. I don’t have any emotional investment in getting out of depression because what’s the point if I’ll get stressed anyways, I know the logic in this argument is nonexistent but idk that’s the argument that my mind went to. So like emotionally I don’t see the point.

Also, there are many downsides to exercising for me. I have scoliosis so exercise will make the back/joint pain much more horrible than a normal person’s. Since I have scoliosis I look extra awkward when running on the treadmill so that’s another deterrent. Point is there are so much more deterrents to exercising than benefits. I’m trying to convince myself that exercising will help me but it’s not working. I prefer k!ll!ng myself but I’m a coward and am scared of permanent paralysis or brain damage.

I find that while I can get myself to weightlift 3x a week, I can't get the best nutrition because I have no energy or will to cook things.. Too unstimulating for my mind. In addition, I've lost the joy from eating anything tasty. Like if there was one miracle food/powder that gave me the best nutrients and macros I need, with bad taste that was trivial to make, I'd take it out of convenience. My poor nutrition comes from ordering UberEats for everything.

To give you an example of my struggle, I used to just put chicken breast into the oven to bake. No prep, just straight from raw chicken breast to oven to my mouth.

Wondering if anyone had good ideas on how to implement a easy but healthy diet, keeping in mind people with ADHD struggle to follow routines.. Diets of like plain greek yogurt, I eat that a lot because it's high in protein and no prep or cooking required.",1709419011.0,
KhobjagelloCohen,On Hard Work,9,1b4sclv,10,"A few years ago, I tried to work out in the gym. I set a goal that within a year, I would grow muscles. It lasted only two months and then I quit. Since then, I gained lots of weight and I still struggle with the idea of getting back in shape, but I realized something. If I go back to the gym, I couldn't work out hard enough to get the reward I wanted, so this dream is kinda dead to me, but I still envy muscular men.

Until very recently, I thought I could do whatever I wanted without putting myself through distress and still get rewarded. I thought I could squeeze as much as I'd like, and get the juice I need. 

Turns out the world doesn't go this way. To get ""rewarded"" or compensated, you have to put yourself through distress and trauma, there's no escape from that. But here's the kicker, what if nothing is worth getting yourself in such distress to begin with? What no amount nor quality of juice justifies squeezing so hard?

This puts me in a very hard position. I'm not given the choice to play easy and get an easy reward, but there's a minimum standard that I have to do, and if I don't do it, I'm screwed.

kevzilla88,"Trouble finding ""my people""",20,1b3efo7,8,"First off, sorry if this counts as complaining or being negative.

I have suffered from depression, bad self esteem and body dysmorphia for pretty much since middle school. Exercise, and specifically lifting and the process of bodybuilding (but not the sport, ill get to that) has literally saved my life, given there were periods that I felt little motivation to continue.

Because of this, lifting has a deep and visceral place in my heart. I yearn to find people to connect with and who I can talk with regarding my various, many unconventional, ideas regarding lifting and to support each other. However, every time I approach the internet, and specifically reddit, in an attempt to find a community, I feel like im immediately ostracized, made fun of, or are disgusted at the way the members treat other posters. I hesitate to call these communities ""toxic"" but its the best word I can find. Granted, I know now that many of the places I went to try to look for a sympathetic ear had very much a reputation for being just that. (I wish there were some sort of ""Toxicity Index"" that I could look up about each sub lol)

This only serves to exacerbate my mental issues especially as I often feel imposter syndrome. To be told by people I feel like I could look up to or see as my peers, that my efforts are dumb/a waste of time/ineffective or that I myself am a horrible lifter (even if those comments are false and coming from a place of ego) is both extremely hurtful and demotivating. Thankfully, thus far I've been able to mentally reframe the situation with an understanding that many of those in the sport/culture of bodybuilding are often coming from a place of insecurity. I too suffer from this, but I feel where the difference lies is that I KNOW im insecure and try not to take it out on others. Many people seem to have no issue letting those insecurities coax them into rage, unrealistic expectations of themselves and others, an obvious sense of superiority verses others them deem ""smaller"" or ""less fit"", and of course rampant drug use.

I found this subreddit actually, from reading posts about the toxicity of fitness and bodybuilding subreddits and im hoping that maybe I can find some like minded people here. I realize that maybe one of the causes of the disconnect is that I am approaching fitness from a personal growth POV when many in the bodybuilding world approach it from a ""alpha"" competition, who is best POV.

Have any of you guys felt this struggle? Would this be a good place for me? Would love to cultivate a community of mutual support, but other subs seem just interested in feeling superior. Given our mutual struggle with mental health, it seemed like a good shot.

I personally try to not even think about my phone when I am exercising. I know many people log and track every single piece of exercise they do or play games to exercise like ZombiesRun. Its so easy to pick up a phone when you are resting during exercise. 

I like to focus 100% on what I am doing when I exercise. There is a safety side to this, If I have a 24kg kettlebell above my head I am not thinking on anything else. Likewise if I am shooting my bow. What is more important is that I am not worrying about anything else. No updates, no messages. Its just me and the exercise.

I don't track my work outs beyond ""I exercised today"". I don't even keep score when I shoot my bow. I was never worried about my batting average when I played cricket. I don't need to know that I was the 13th fastest finisher in my age group when I do a parkrun.

rob_cornelius,Using exercise to connect with nature,12,1b1afg7,2,"We all know exercise is good for our mental health in one way or another. Its also well known that being in nature is a big boost for mental health too. Yet for some reason for many of us exercise means being stuffed into a brick and steel box that has a view of the car park if you are lucky.

Its not just walking, running and cycling that can be done outdoors. There is swimming (not that I would swimming go in any river or sea here in the UK apart from the far north of Scotland thanks to pollution) calisthenics, weight training and lots more that can be done outdoors. Then there are sports like Orienteering which is specifically outdoors (if you don't know what it is you turn up to a location. You are given a map and compass and you run between set points where you sign in. Its running and navigation combined) Things like field archery are quite different to target archery too.

Many parks here in the UK have free outdoor gyms, basically some machines that use your bodyweight to provide resistance for things like bench presses, rows etc and rugged ellipticals plus pull up bars and other things to help with calisthenics. Even my small town here in rural Southern England has some.

You can also adapt what is around you for exercise. I sometimes go into the woods near my home to lift fallen logs, do sprints and other HIIT type things, Picking up a big log or rock is a vastly different challenge to a barbell, dumb bell or kettlebell. It makes your mind work as well as your body and that's good too. Learning new skills helps our mental health.

Kids playgrounds are great for fitness activities too. Many playgrounds have moved on from the basic swings and slides. There are often balance things, things to climb up, jump onto and swing from. Monkey bars are great. Just use your imagination but make sure you let the kids go first.

Gardening and other yard work is great exercise. Digging, weeding, mowing and more are hard physical work especially with no power tools. When I had a lawn to mow where I used to live I would wear a weighted vest or leg weights to make it even harder work.

There are often volunteer opportunities with local environmental groups, some even advertise themselves as ""green gyms"". My town has a litter picking event every weekend. You turn up, get given some bags etc and a street or two to clean up. How about collecting litter on your running route? When I was a student I spent many happy Sundays helping to clear invasive rhododendrons from local woodlands. It was extremely hard work as volunteers are not allowed things like chainsaws so it was hand saws, axes, machetes and come along winches plus lots of hard labour for us. We would often be literally covered in mud from head to toe and few cuts and bruises too but by the time we finished we had the biggest smiles on our faces.

A lot of team sports are outdoors too of course. Football (soccer), cricket, hockey, netball, rugby, baseball, lacrosse, outdoor basketball and more. Its hard to notice nature in the middle of a team sport but you are outdoors and exercising.

There are even studies that say that getting properly dirty and muddy is good for our mental health. The smells that soil and especially things like compost and leaf litter give off are proven to have mental health benefits.

Being mindful of nature is well known for being good for our mental health. Listen to the birds singing and watch what they are doing. Notice seasonal changes, spot the little plants growing in the cracks on the sidewalk, enjoy peoples gardens as you pass by. Notice smells, even if it is manure or a dead creature. Go to the library and find a book to learn more about the plants, birds or animals or even the geology in your area. Learning new things again...

rob_cornelius,The relationship between anxiety and exercise,16,1axvvwz,6,"Exercise helps our anxiety in the long term but in the short term it can make us anxious. When you get under a bar to try to beat your bench PR when you are not 100% sure you can make it. When you turn up to your first real race and don't know what to do. When you arrive late to the yoga class and the only spot left is front and centre. Just running or cycling in the city in a full of arseholes in cars. There are thousands more.

Generally speaking we *overcome* these anxieties. When we do we prove to ourselves that our anxiety does not define us. When we break a PR we flip from anxiety to jumping for joy in an instant. When a stranger helps you through the registration process at a race and runs with you for a while to make sure you are ok we feel that the world is a less scary place that has good people in it. When the yoga instructor praises us and suggests the class take note of what you are doing you literally feel seen. Cycling and running in traffic is a skill to be perfected. So is giving that dumb fuck in a truck the finger.

Every single time you do something like that for the first time makes subsequent times easier. We learn that our anxieties are often baseless. What seemed almost impossible is actually pretty easy. OK its worth having a healthy respect for cycling in heavy traffic.

It was started by a creator called Hope Zuckerbrow and [here's a link to a healthline article](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/cozy-cardio-can-the-tiktok-fitness-trend-really-help-you-get-in-shape) about it. In her videos, she shows how she uses an indoor walking pad, cozy slippers, a warm beverage and a rom-com, and walks for about forty minutes most days.

I'm inspired to make this post by another one I saw on this sub today by someone who is pushing themselves to meet the US guideline of 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly, and hating every second of it. Moderate exercise is a good for health! But for some people like myself it sometimes feels unachievable. 

I would like to be a runner one day. That might yet happen, but right now it's so intimidating that it's putting me off exercise completely. I'm reminding myself today to move my body in ways that feel good to me. I'm borrowing from the harm reduction strategies that I learned in therapy.

rob_cornelius,Exercise teaches us how to be humble,7,1avdm7n,2,"We all know people who think the world revolves around them. People who show off, who push themselves into other peoples business, people who turn the conversation to them, people who can't be in a photo unless they are striking a pose, people who put other people down and tell them they are not as good as them. People who boast and brag about everything they do. Show offs. Psychologists put many labels on these types of people. I use the label ""arseholes"". 

Exercise helps us not to be an arsehole. Unless you are the current undisputed world champion there is always someone better than you when you are exercising and even then the hot new contender is around the corner. In fact everyone is the same when we exercise even the world champion. Two hundred pounds is two hundred pounds for everyone. Running 26 miles is the same for everyone. Some people find it easier to lift two hundred pounds or run 26 miles but everyone has to do the same thing.

If you exercise regularly you know how injuries can bring you crashing down to earth. Last week you could run for hours, now putting weight on your foot is agony. Last week you could squat double your bodyweight, now you are flat on your back for a few weeks and might need surgery. This teaches us not to boast and brag as we know it can all be taken away in an instant.

When we see someone exercising we can appreciate what they are going through. That might be a woman jogging in the park, a guy going by on his bike or a person doing pull ups on the kids monkey bars at the play park. We know how hard it is to exercise. It makes us sympathetic towards that person. We can cheer them on a little even if its just a nod of recognition. We also emphasize with them too as we know how much mental effort went into them exercising, we know what they are going through. We appreciate their efforts.

We can help one another when we exercise too. Putting the weights away when you are finished with them. Stopping to help someone who has fallen over at a parkrun even though it will ruin your time. Showing someone who is new to yoga how to relax and breathe into a posture when the instructor is helping someone else. A few quiet words of encouragement or yelling ""LIGHT WEIGHT"" (in the right sort of gym).

strengthtoovercome,[Fitness Resource] Functional fitness exercise database that I created for your workouts (Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets),23,1at1uon,2,"

Hi r/EOOD community, 

I created a searchable functional fitness exercise database in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets for personal trainers and fitness coaches, but I think that it is a useful tool for anyone that is interested in fitness and improving the quality of their life. I also posted this in the r/personaltraining subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/s/BI4l6Bs9W0) and it seemed to be helpful - I thought I’d share with this community as well. 

It is time consuming to sift through all the exercise information available on the internet (multiple exercise databases, YouTube videos, fitness pages/social media), so I made this to have all of the data in one spreadsheet that can be quickly filtered for your exercise search. The database has more than 25 search filters available for over 1200 + functional exercises - allowing you to find the information you need in seconds when designing fitness programs or learning new movement patterns. 

The fitness library also includes exercises using the barbell, dumbbells, kettlebells, gymnastics rings, parallette bars, calisthenics, clubbells, indian clubs, maces, the landmine attachment, suspension trainer, sliders and other functional equipment that you may not have used for your current workouts. All exercises requiring you to move, stabilize, and develop functional and pain free strength.

It has been a fun project for me to chip away at when I’m not training, so please give it a try and let me know your thoughts!

Many of us here have been exercising for years. However if you look back at posts in the sub you will see the question ""how do I start exercising?"" time and time again. A lot of people who are wanting to use exercise to help with their mental health issues haven't exercised since they were in school and they probably hated it then.

We were all that newbie in the gym who doesn't know how to work the machines and is full of anxiety once. For them just showing up is a massive achievement. It might be a personal record/best for them. Of course if you have been going to the gym for ages and you are still anxious then don't force yourself, sometimes all it takes in a nod of recognition and appreciation though.

So, if you can, take a minute or two to ask ""can I help"" or ""are you ok?"" and put yourselves in their shoes before you answer. You can be the friendly person in the gym who helps everyone or the person at parkrun who stays after they have finished to cheer on everyone as they cross the line.

There is a tradition of this in practically every society in the world. Spaces are reserved to exercise in and they are ""different"". People who spend time in these spaces come back changed in some way. These places could be a training camp for the military, an arena for fights, a sweat lodge, a race track and many more.

Some exercise places become famous. Modern stadiums for professional sports teams certainly are. Perhaps a boxing gym that produces champions will achieve fame too. Many exercise places are more mundane. Modern gyms are often just big brick and steel boxes next to a warehouse or shopping mall. They don't look special from the outside but it is what goes on the inside that matters.

When you enter a place where you exercise you are entering a special place with deep links back into history and culture. It doesn't matter if that place is a clinically clean big box corporate gym, a fighting gym that stinks of sweat and blood, a muddy field with some lines painted on it and two sets of goal posts  or your own living room which assumes the role for a while.

Grief and depression are in some ways alike and in other ways very different. I think experimenting with coping strategies is needed for both though.

What matters is you do *something*. You are taking back a tiny bit of control over your life. You are making yourself better. You don't need a runners high rush of happy brain chemicals to make yourself better. You need determination, discipline, dedication and more positive aspects of your character that mental health has taken from you.

There could be hundreds of reasons why I didn't manage to finish 7000m. Anything from not drinking before I started to not having slept well last night (I get up and get on my rowing machine). It doesn't matter ultimately.

This comment still bothers me today. I need to learn to better let go of such reactions. The thing is, most of the time I myself do not care whether I am doing it “correctly.” That’s mostly why I like working out on my own in my own home so that there is no one to judge me though logically I know that at a gym no one would judge me like this.

I have been working hard trying to overcome my perfectionism, and also when speaking with my kids to avoid such comments.

I made a mistake trying to show this yesterday, but I guess it is natural trying to share the excitement of something I enjoy. And I guess at 50 I have not yet reached the “don’t care what my parent thinks of me” mental state, but I want to try to improve that.

Here in Southern England we don't get snow often and cold spells or heat waves don't last that long. Of course it rains a lot.

Normally if I am exercising outdoors I try to tough it out. Swinging my kettlebell in the snow or heat and doing a parkrun in the pouring rain with muddy puddles up to my ankles at times. I actually enjoy the feeling of overcoming the elements. I just don't often have really bad weather to overcome.

Right now and for the last three years I am the primary caregiver for my mother who is in stage 4 cancer treatment. She lives someplace very rural and cold and dark, not anyplace I grew up or have a connection to, and she moved here just before the pandemic then got sick so has never really gotten to build social networks here. I put my stuff in storage on the other side of the continent in order to move into a bedroom in her house. I work remotely and have for many years, and because of being both rural and my mom's vulnerability to COVID, we are very very isolated. I know that this situation is ABSOLUTELY contributing to my depression and also making it very hard to drag myself out of it. 

Add to that: I've been exercise reluctant my whole life. I can start to gradually build up some strength in yoga or taking walks, but quickly fall off the wagon. I know it helps me even when I do a little bit. 

But right now, with the cold, my long work schedule, the lack of any kind of in person social connection (many many many long distance friends however who stay in touch) and the low-grade but consistent support my mom needs, exercising goes to the absolute bottom of the pile. It's down there below hygiene, which is also taking a hit with my present mood. I am constantly tired, and I know it's from growing physical weakness and lack of conditioning, and from mood. 

How do you make enough hours in the day and then how do you tell yourself that EXERCISE is the way you're going to fill those hours, when you would much rather do something more immediately pleasurable like....read or vegetate on the couch looking at my phone?

Words are very powerful and have the ability to shape our thoughts. Mental illness has the same power and abilities as words. The language we use affects our mental illness and vice versa.

Mental illness can rob us of our deeper positive thoughts and emotions. Anhedonia literally steals the ability to feel pleasure from us. Depression in general makes everything dull and flat. Nothing has any depth.

By making ourselves exercise when we really don't want to and would much rather stay in bed and pull the covers over our head we are reclaiming a small part of this way of thinking from our mental illness. We prove to ourselves that there is more than what mental illness lies to us about.

We prove to ourselves we do have hidden depths. We prove to ourselves that our mental illness was hiding them. We prove to ourselves that we have deep reserves of strength, courage, will-power and discipline deep in our hearts. We prove to ourselves that we can do something good and become a better person.

The plan is a ""beginners"" plan but it assumes you can row 5000m at a reasonable pace before you start it. Getting to that point took some work. Last Friday I rowed 5000m at ~130W output and I felt I had more in the tank so I felt I was ready to start.

Monday morning. First session. Row 5500m at your ""normal"" pace. I barely made it. I honestly don't know why but on Monday rowing was torture while it felt good three days before. I stopped briefly 4 times and I was rowing at a much reduced output. I did row 5500m though.

Every single time I restarted and when I finished I proved I could do **something** I could make myself carry on. In fact I proved I could do something just by starting.

It was also humbling. When I sat on my rowing machine I thought I would breeze through the distance. Boy was I wrong. It brought me back into contact with cold, hard reality. As Henry Rollings said ""200lbs is always 200lbs"". You can't lie and cheat on exercise.

Now thinking on that experience on Monday I feel good about it. I didn't quit, I kept going. I got it done. I **overcame**. I looked depression in the eye and called it a liar for saying I couldn't keep going. That is worth a hell of a lot in my book.",1705569105.0,

The French philosopher ~~Jean Paul Sartre~~ Albert Camus said that we have to assume Sisyphus is happy as he has a purpose in life. It might be a shitty purpose that he can never fulfil but he knows what he is doing and why he is doing it. He has a goal to aim at even if its impossible.

Exercise and particularly EOOD can seem like you are Sisyphus. We work hard and it can seem like we are getting nowhere. Our bodies don't lose or gain weight as fast as we would like. We don't progress as fast as we would like. Sometimes it just fucking **hurts**.

We have a purpose though. We don't give up. We rest when we have to and then we start again. We keep going. We **overcome**. Hopefully that means we are happy like Sisyphus.

TayBae838,Help Question: If I’m always increasing my running distance will I always be exhausted?,9,195q0od,5,"Hi everyone, I was hoping some of the experienced runners could help me with this question. I’ve been trying to get back to cardio exercise after a couple of years of bad depression and anxiety. I’m enjoying being back and I missed running. I’m up to running about 4 miles right now on my long runs.

Overall I think it’s been more positive than negative so far but I’m definitely feeling extremely exhausted from it and that leads to some bad physical and mental states, especially in terms of being anxious or feeling like there’s something wrong with my brain which is definitely a part of my health anxiety. My cross training days are rest days and my rest days are do-nothing-at-all days. It’s not surprising to me because I’ve been so inactive for so long and I’m trying to be patient with myself. 

The question that I have is based around setting long-term goals for my running practice. Part of me wants to aim for a half marathon as this would give me something to target and train for. My girlfriend and I will be flying to Ireland to visit one of our friends in April and according to some of the running plans I have found online I should be able to run a half marathon with him that weekend in The Iris Countryside.

 The concern for me would be that if I’m increasing my mileage every week, even just a little, is my fatigue going to be a constant? Or to say it differently: is my body only going to become comfortable and adjusted to running once I level off and plateau at a certain mileage point? If I’m going to be as tired and mentally shaky as I am right now for the next 14 weeks of half marathon training then it’s probably not worth it because I don’t think I can afford 14 weeks of being grouchy and tired and out of it. But if my body is going to adjust and I’m going to reach a point where adding a half a mile a week or so to my long run is not going to be such a big deal then I think pursuing the half marathon would be a good idea.

Any advice or experiences you could share would be greatly appreciated !!",1705158559.0,

rob_cornelius,I saw an interview with a remarkable woman on TV today. Captain Harpreet Chandi trekked solo and unsupported across Antartica,17,1949f9w,7,"The Guardian has an [article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/30/british-soldier-harpreet-chandi-world-record-fastest-woman-ski-alone-across-antarctica) but that does no justice to her story.

Trekking alone across Antartica is basically life and death every single day. Yes she of course she had a satallite phone but that one call for help is more to tell people where to look for your body. If there is a blizzard there is no way that rescuers will get to you in time as helicopters can't fly in those conditions. Don't get enough miles in a given day puts everything at risk, likewise pushing too far when conditions are good means you will exhaust yourself and your food supply too quickly. On average she had to ski for 13 hours every day pulling her sled. Thats an incredible physical challenge.

Captain Chandi went through hell on her trek. She said that she was in ""a very, very dark place"" for most of her journey. She wanted to just stop, sit on the ice and give up everything. If she did that she would almost certainly die, if not right there and then but later on.

She spoke about having to keep going in white out blizzards so bad she could barely see her own feet in the driving snow. Everything apart from her and her sled was white and blowing around at close to 100mph at times. That would be incredibly difficult for anyone but if you know you want to just give up and die every single step of the way... well it doesn't bear thinking about for long.

Her only solution was to try to distract herself from the darkest places in her mind. That could be mentally going over checklists of everything she had to do to make camp, make food and just survive. She spoke of just counting strides in a white out blizzard. It was the only way to prevent herself from giving up.

I think we can all learn from Captain Chandi. She found a way to get through hell by doing simple things. She said she had to keep her mind busy. If that was going over what pretty awful freeze dried food she had to eat that day in the most minute detail or just counting strides towards her goal that meant she could survive.

I have a tendency to not eat at all, so having structured mealtimes and incorporating vegetables have done wonders. I still struggle, but this seems to help.

I've had to take break from it because of a failed antidepressant. One of the side affects for that medication was increased hunger. Which was great for my underweight self. Without that, my appetite relapsed to its original self and I was back to eating barely anything at all. Then I got smacked with a depressive episode. I decided that It wasn't safe for me to work out on less than 1000 calories a day and to take a break until I get put on another one.

It sucks so hard. With the antidepressant, I managed to weasel in some healthy habits like self care. (Basic hygiene, yoga,Vitamins) Without that, it just all fell apart. I haven't eaten in days, my hygiene is slipping. It's getting harder to get out of bed. The negative thoughts are creeping back as if they never left. I clawed my way out of this pit tooth and nail.

Now, with Fibromyalgia I'm no stranger to the idea that less movement will make it worse, which is hard to internalize but rocking and stimming in general seems to help as well as repeating the mantra ""motion is lotion"" while I stretch to help get over the stiffest parts.   


But anything more complex than that leaves me absolutely winded. Yes, I am obese as well and I have frequently always been ashamed when being out of breath and told ""this is why you need to work out more"" which was counterproductive as hell. This led to me sometimes holding my breath when I'm reaching that pain threshold so I don't get comments on it, and if I cant help it but hear myself panting, I always feel a lot of shame for being ""out of shape."" 

More often than not when I go into an activity with the intention of exercise, like doing repetitions of specific exercises, everything hurts a lot more and I also get angrier and angrier with myself as it goes on for being so weak and unable to push through. 

So usually my exercise of choice involves gamification, particularly VR like Beat Saber. Now, I can play Beat Saber alternating sitting down/standing for up to 45 minutes, but I sweat like a pig EVERYWHERE, feel dizzy, usually end up over extending a shoulder even though I did a dynamic stretch beforehand and then when I shower I'm suddenly wracked with overwhelming anxiety. In fact, thats how i found this sub in the first place, looking up why the fuck am I the only person to feel actively worse after exercise. 

Its not as though this was always the case, one time back in 2016 I won a dance contest to the song Cheap Thrills by Sia, by the halfway point I was definitely tired but I paced myself through the song and lasted until the end (around 3 minutes of standing) and I was so out of breath from my asthma that I was wheezing for about 15 minutes. Downed a whole water bottle in like 30 seconds. 

I dont know if I'm just too fucked up for things to work out or if I need to be more gentle. I just always always feel so sickened by myself when theres a really easy task and i struggle so much with the most basic of things (i mean why else am I applying for ssi)

sometimes i feel really left out of conversations because for hells sake I even use a walker with wheels to be able to walk longer distances outside. I'm also less than age 30 too.

I'm already on so much medication. I don't want to be on more. So I did it. This morning I got up to go for a walk. Then I did something I've never done before. I decided to run. I'm not good at it, and I probably looked like I was dying, but I did two miles with intervals of running for 30 seconds to a minute sprinkled in there.

On weekends, even just doing 1 activity like going thrifting or grocery shopping has been enough exertion to make me crawl into bed for the rest of the day. My usual motivation for going on walks or rowing workouts has completely disappeared, and even hanging out with my friends totally drains me.

I talked to my doctor last week about how I'm always tired, and I thought it was just depression being depression, but blood work revealed that my B12 levels were very low-- low enough that I'll need to do regular self-injections for quite a while (1/day for a week, 1/week for a month, then 1/month for the rest of the year). ((As a side note, I take proton-pump inhibitors for chronic gastritis, so my gut doesn't absorb B12 very well through food))

Make sure to stay on top of your blood work! It was also suspected that it could be a vitamin D, iron or thyroid issue. All of these deficiencies can cause huge problems. One side effect that definitely should've clued me in to the B12 deficiency was that my wrist & fingers kept going numb.. low B12 can cause (sometimes permanent) nerve damage, along with a slew of other complications (like depression!!!) if left untreated.

,How to deal with the reality that gym is pretty much pointless for me?,23,18wm8n2,56,"Hey. So, I've been suffering from depression for 2/3 of my life now (I'm 35, male), and this is my second attempt at trying to maintain a gym routine. The first one was 5 years ago, and ended up in a mental breakdown due to a combination of factors, one of them being not seeing any results after one year. That was probably due to my trainer being half-assed and trying really hard to not get me hurt, because I have a life-long disability, and my joints are damaged - specifically, my elbows. Can barely reach my ass to wipe it with my left arm, and my right arm is an atrophied noodle arm. Some of the exercises cause nasty joint pain. It doesn't last, but it is incredibly unpleasant. No complaints about muscle pain. 

Half a year ago I've began feeling a bit better, and managed to force myself to exercise under a different trainer, and started seeing weight results after just a few weeks. However, it came to a crashing halt when I realised how severely limited I am. The fact that I won't have a pretty body, and that I will be limited to small weights, absolutely crushed my soul. This, alongside not having any desire to overeat, pretty much will end up in wasted time again. The ""feel good"" part of the gym only lasts for about an hour, and then the ever present reality of ""I will never be pretty and strong"" washes it away, and it is barely worth it due to having to endure the pain in my elbows. It's my fault for falling for these self-inflicted delusions, but what's done is done. 

How can I cope with this realization? Please, only actual advice I can apply myself, and no ""therapy"" and no ""take your meds"" advise - did that already, and it only made things worse. ",1704190820.0,

I (24F) had a depressive episode end of last year that lasted until July. During that episode, I started my fitness journey by going to the gym in January as something that would help me get out of the gutter.


Even if I felt depressed 99% of the time I really enjoyed working out since I’ve always been sporty, and I found a safe space there. I also held myself accountable by having a private story on Snapchat where I talked about my progress, what I ate, or even just showed random pictures of machines just to share that I was working out. Doing that motivated a lot of friends to workout and I kinda started being their personal trainer, which made me super happy and helped me get out of my head.

I had a great summer where I felt like I was at peace after months of fighting for my life, but I relapsed in October and I feel like I’m reaching new levels of low mental health each day. (Long story short I recently went through a shit ton of romantic and friendship breakups that brought up a lot of traumatic memories, so I’m pretty much all by myself now. The few friends I have left are not that available to hang out though we do text each other quite often, and they’re also gym rats)

I stopped going to the gym mid-October, which really sucks because I have no other way to release the stress and anxiety if I don’t go. Depression felt so bad at some point that I had to do group classes of different sports (yoga, pilates, aqua fitness etc) every now and then to keep my mind off committing suicide, and I liked these classes a lot. Unfortunately it’s pretty expensive so I stopped going, but I tried to at least walk a lot whenever I had to go out and whenever I felt like the depression was too much for me to handle I’d go out and do whatever that comes to mind so I don’t stay by myself with all these thoughts. I don’t do that anymore though, because I don’t even want to.

I have a very good therapist that helps me a lot, and I’m on my 3rd week of taking antidepressants, but I feel like wasting my meds because I don’t feel the want or need to get out of my depression. I really love sports overall and I wish I had the will to start my fitness journey again, but I can’t bring myself to go back to the gym or do anything physical and that makes me sad.

I’m on Christmas break starting Friday until Jan 3rd included, and I’m not even excited to get that break I desperately wanted because I won’t have anything to do, and I don’t want to do shit besides sleeping and be anxious all day even if I know it’s making me feel worse than if I went out and do something.",1703150105.0,

There are also quite a few bits of organised exercise like 5k Santa Runs, cold water swims etc at this time of year. If you don't fancy a dip in the ocean then watching and cheering can be a chance to get out of the house.

Apart from that I try to have an escape route. If I am really desperate I hide in the bathroom for a while.

One more good thing I know is that if you weigh yourself on Boxing Day after eating all day on the big day you haven't gained seven pounds overnight. That extra weight is just water and poo. The quaint old English saying of ""They are thick as a Boxing Day turd"" has a lot of truth in it.

Sadly, I'm too broke right now to afford therapy, and just thinking about looking for a job makes me extremely tired mentally (had some terrible experiences on my last job that I left 6 months ago). I would absolutely love some more energy, so I could do more things in my daily life and try to get out of this situation. 

Yesterday I cleaned my room, my arms and legs hurt like hell, but I feel that the little exercise and having my room cleaner made a huge impact my mental. I want to keep going. Also I was so tired that I got some of the best sleep I had in the last year or so.

So basically, what I want is: start exercising to get more energy and do more things that are good for my mental health, like cleaning stuff (and preferably not be extremely tired after).

I tried a lot of exercise routines. 30 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes. Never could stick to any of them. I really don't like exercising, and at my current situation, I can't really ask myself to do something I hate to improve myself (depression kinda makes me hate myself and get really autodestructive, so eventually I just think give up.

I also can't find something ""fun"" to do, like martial arts or dancing. Right now I'm struggling really hard to leave my house, all my friends are extremely far away and interacting to people is really hard.

I was thinking of putting some workouts between my gaming sessions. I play a lot of fighting games and matches are normally pretty fast, so I could add a bit of exercise between them. It would be a lot easier to do the thing I hate between things I like. I searched around a little on the internet and a lot of answers were like ""that won't work, do some real workout instead"". Well, I would love to, but as someone who's struggling to keep my myself alive, that's asking too much.

So I'm looking for plans to do that. I always hear about the 10 push ups everytime you die in game or something, but I wanted to have a more balanced set of exercise. Nothing too fancy, since obviously is not something I want to do forever, but something I want to do to start something, get a little bit better and try to get out of this.

(PS: I know it feels like I'm complaining too much and that I should be doing something else, but right now I know my limits and sadly, I can't do much. But I can do small things, and I want those small things to add up, eventually, hopefully...)

,LETS GOOO,23,18cpfp4,7,"yall it worked!!! back in 2020 I was pretty much jobless for a year, suicidal, suuuper bummed out about my prospects in everything, social skills at zero, etc. Id been like that on and off since highschool. you know the drill. self harm, suicidal ideation, sleeping too much, doom scrolling &spiraling etc.

I took up a bit of exercising in 2021, then got a job that got me out of the house/regularly cycling and doing sports like beer league softball and volleyball, and I started bjj in late 2022. I sucked ass at these things but I had to, and I didn't want to not do them and be sucked back into not doing anything at all. Plus doing stuff meant my body hurt less than when I didnt (bjj also serves as chiropractice).

A chunk of it was working out and the biology of it all, but I think a bigger chunk of it was having to redevelop all the social skills I lost and in the process re-evaluate my ruminations. these were all social sports and by god I was an awkward loser but I got out of my head and now I'm just not so much in my head...

Im physically healthy, I have stamina, I have confidence in my social skills. I'm not great but **I've gotten to average**!!!!!!! This is above and beyond where I was even in highschool. I'm at the point where Im thriving some days not just surviving, and suicidal ideation just seems kinda dumb. not because life is easy, but because I can see a way to take it on. I am going to bite and I am going to chew.

it sucked ass and I would break down crying randomly when I first started but now I dont. Even my panic attacks are dying down. I still get them but at least Im not dissociating the whole day. I even had the confidence to plan and do a solo trip as a woman for the heck of it. and it was fun! I didnt die!

michiganlibrarian,It’s OK if exercising doesn’t work for your depression.,52,18bpuky,10,"I’ve been depressed for most of my life. In high school running distance completely eliminated my depression. As the years went on though, I became more and more treatment resistant even though I would work out (not to the extent of distance running). 

I’ve noticed especially the last few years that on days where I’d do cardio, the very next day I’d feel awful and foggy headed. I recently asked my psychiatrist about this and she explained her theory: those of us depressed have low neurotransmitter levels. When we work out we see a big spike in dopamine and endorphins immediately during and after a work out. For some people this can in time create balance and you leave your depression behind. However for me, since I’m treatment resistant, all it does is spike my feel good chemicals and then the next day is a type of withdrawal since your brain can’t make up those added feel good chemicals that it needs. Essentially I could work out like an Olympian and still have depression. For what it’s worth - I’m trying ECT next month in hopes of it relieving my depression. My doc has high hopes for me.

JoannaBe,Exploring Innerworld - so far very promising!,5,187vx8a,0,"Note: I am not affiliated with Innerworld, just recently signed up for a free account.

So I recently joined a virtual community called Innerworld. They have apps on Virtual Reality Quest, Windows and MacOS, and iPhone. (Edit: I found out today that they are close to releasing the Android version.) What is it? It is a free to join peer led virtual community. Unlike here on r/EOOD where we interact in writing asynchronously (not live), most interaction in Innerworld is through voice chat during live events. One creates an anonymous account there, people hear your voice and see your avatar and chosen screen name.

What kind of live events do they have? So far I have just chatted a bit in their Commons (lobby?), attended an open mic type virtual event, and a workshop discussing some cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) tools. Tomorrow I might join a meet and greet type event for newbies if I have my act together by 7am and/or a guided meditation group session at noon.

There are a number of events like these at different times during the day, for example tomorrow they have 19 different events scheduled (some of them are during a time when I am asleep though, and 3 of them are only accessible to those who choose to pay for a subscription - most of their content is free though).

And one can attend as many or as few events as one likes and as fit into one’s schedule. One can also attend part of an event - leave early or join late.

So far everyone whom I have “met” there has been friendly and supportive. I found out that they have separate events for adults and for teens, as based on one’s birth month and year during account creation. None of the people there are known to be professional therapists, but every event has a guide who got some training before becoming a guide and guides generally lead the workshops / facilitate events, and can mute or kick out someone if needed or help people who are confused.",1701385223.0,

rob_cornelius,Sustainable exercise is better for our minds,31,185th1x,7,"Not sustainable as in the environment but sustainable as in something we can keep doing regularly without too much pain or mental pressure.

Its really easy to overdo it when we exercise. We push ourselves just that bit too much and while we might feel great at the time thanks to a runner's high we feel the pain of DOMs or an injury later. I am willing to bet we all fall into the trap fairly frequently, I know I do.

Of course sometimes we want to push ourselves as hard as we can. We are trying for a Personal Best or something similar. As part of that we need to accept that its going to hurt one way or another. What a lot of people forget is that pushing our bodies to their limits is also incredibly mentally taxing too. Its just as hard to make yourself do something you know will hurt as it is to do the actual act.

I often find that when I do go for a PB I am not only physically exhausted, I am mentally 
drained too. It can take a while to get back to where I was before both mentally and physically. A couple of days, maybe a little more.

Of course we need to push ourselves to exercise. Its better to be able to exercise frequently at a lower intensity than to exercise irregularly and be physically and mentally broken all the time.

TerrorMaltie,Extremely scared of starting exercise again,9,183ofsw,5,"Hey y'all. This is an issue I've been having for a year now and it's breaking me mentally.

Ever since I had COVID about 6 months ago, I've been extremely scared of starting to exercise again. 

I used to be fit, took a break because of panic attacks (Stupid, I know), but then COVID hit and it wrecked me entirely. My lungs had issues for weeks, my muscles felt weak and I kept getting more and more scared of exercising. I'm constantly depressed and anxious and a big part of it is this lack of exercise. I gained a lot of weight and I'm constantly in pain.

I'm extremely scared of actually getting to know ALL the effects that COVID had on me. I used to try going biking during summer, even though it was hellish. I noticed how my heart only pumped enough blood for my legs, my arms would start cramping and hurting a lot. I had to keep pumping them so it didn't happen. I fought my way with hiking, since it helped my lungs. I couldn't even swim because it felt like I had an iron dome around my lungs. My muscles also still feel weak some days, but that's more like lack of exercise due to fears. It doesnt feel the same as during covid anymore.

I also get a whole load of anxiety during and after exercise. I'm guessing it's because my heart rate is high and the anxiety pot that's already simmering inside my brain boils over.

I guess I'm afraid to see exactly how unfit I've gotten thanks to everything. I'm scared of getting an asthma attack, scared of having to start at zero, worse than I've ever had to start. 

Does anyone know how to just... brave through this? Did anyone have the same?

Niall's mate Jeffery is his depression. He decided to make his depression ""separate"" from himself. When his depression was bad and he had thoughts like ""You can't do that, you are a failure"" and all the other negative thoughts we all know too well he would try to think, ""That's not me talking, that's my depression talking, I am not like that"".

He externalised his depression in psychological terms. It became a separate entity. So he gave it a name. Jeffery was the dumbest sounding name he could think of so his depression was called Jeffery (apologies to any Jefferys out there)

The other important part was that Jeffery was his mate, they went everywhere together if nothing else. Its easy to hate your mental illness, its fucking with your entire life after all. Niall realised that hating Jeffery was ultimately hating himself though. So he made friends with Jeffery. Not best buddies but at least a mate. Someone you might well disagree with about many things but you still talk to them.

rob_cornelius,The importance of mindset,14,17vwcvv,4,"You can read a lot about mindset right now. Grinding, hustling, being ""alpha"" and all that bullshit. Mindset is important though, especially when exercising and particularly when exercising with poor mental health.

If you start a work out by thinking to yourself its going to be physically painful, you will be hot, sweaty and uncomfortable and feel like shit by the time you finishing making your stupid body do all the stupid things to exercise then guess what will happen?

That is not to say you have to be all macho and tough to grind your way through every single workout. Far, far from it. When I start a work out I try to be open to receiving what ever happens. I hope I will feel better for doing it. I hope I will finish it. Sometimes that doesn't happen. Those are just short term things though. I know long term I will be faster, have better endurance or be stronger even if I quit halfway through or half-arse the workout.

It is always a good thing to just start. Thinking ""I will go for a walk"" and then opening the front door to find its pouring with rain and thinking ""maybe not today"" is still a tiny, tiny victory. You wanted to do something to help you cope with your mental health problems. That still counts. Next time do some stretches indoors instead. Just make sure there is a next time.

When you can get into a mindset of ""I am going to exercise now"" to make your body do the stupid exercises you can get into that mindset for other problems in your life. Its still not grinding or macho. You can just think ""I am going to try to do this. I hope I can succeed.""

That's all any of us can do with anything in our lives, we try, we hope to succeed. Poor mental health tells us ""Why bother, you will fail"". It forces us into that mindset. We can use the mindset from exercise to at least try. Its a huge victory over our mental health.

You can do it. Keep trying and you will do it.",1700062878.0,

rob_cornelius,Today is World Kindness Day,9,17uie2q,0,"Being kind is simply the best quality a person can have. Being kind makes the world a better place.

Be kind to your loved ones. Just make time to be there with them. Listen, offer help, support and advice and expect nothing in return. Just be full of love

Be kind to your friends and colleauges. When someone is having a bad day a cup of tea and five minutes can turn everything around. Sometimes you can do other bigger things to be kind too. Take those opportunities with both hand but don't judge and don't push too hard with your kindness

Be kind to people you meet in real life and on line. Smile at small children (always, *always*, **always** be kind to small children) in the supermarket checkout queue. Show the elderly person in the ATM queue how to use the new ATM machine. Be polite and respectful to everyone in real life and on line. Don't rush to judgement and try to find common ground to explore differences constructively instead of hurling abuse.

Be kind to non-humans too. Animals, plants, habitats and even whole ecosystems. Don't take too much and give back more than you take.

There are many, many opportunities to be kind at every level every single day. Make the world a better place and you will make yourself a better person.

Those are the ""runners high"" and improved self-esteem. I think these are prioritised as they are relatively easy to measure in a statistically meaningful way.

There are many other benefits from exercise to be had though. Things like

* *better fitness just makes life easier*, running for a bus, moving heavy things
* *increased sense of identity*, instead of being a mentally ill person we become a runner, lifter
* *confidence in our abilities*, If I can lift a heavy thing I can apply that to other parts of my life
* *reduced stress* we all know how we burn off stress when we work out
* *getting outdoors to exercise* touching grass
* *learning new skills* learning how to exercise safely helps us mentally
* *better relaxation after exercise* a well deserved portion of time to unwind is always good
* *increased creativity* I write really good code in my head when I am on my rowing machine, at least until I run it for real
* *inspiring others* When people see the physical and mental change in us it makes them want to try.
* *helping others* putting other peoples weights away helps us become better people.
* *improved executive function* exercising consistently takes determination, dedication and discipline. 

There are lots more. Those were off the top of my head.

JoannaBe,"Modifications, half-assing workouts",10,17gvtvf,3,"So I thought that maybe I have been making the incorrect impression that I am more athletic than I actually am in some of my posts.

I am a master of modifications that make workouts easier: running slowly, pushups on knees, pullups with assist bands, walking instead of jumping my feet in burpees, bending knees to reach toes, stretching legs apart only a little bit instead of wide, hopping on one leg when I am supposed to be standing still on it, touching foot to floor when needed, etc.

I think modifications are totally legit to do and nothing to be ashamed of. It is better to do a highly modified workout and try what one can than to not do it at all. And hey if one continues working out one may surprise oneself someday to actually be able to do some pushups without knees touching the floor etc but even if not, it’s still ok. Of course sometimes it is hard to figure out when one is compromising form or when one makes injury more likely rather than less likely - and that is especially challenging for those of us who do not have enough background in how to train - that’s part of why I like doing most of my workouts to videos because then I can observe how someone who knows what they are doing would do it, and a lot of those workout videos do have a modifier or the instructor mentions a suggested modification.

Rickythrow,Tips on manageable running goals while dealing with mental (and physical) health issues?,4,17fugqj,6,"I preface the following just for context:

I used to run fairly regularly, roughly 20km a week spread across 3-4 runs. I've run in a handful of 10K events, generally coming in at around 65 minutes, and I've also run in a couple of half-marathons, coming in at 2:20-2:30 or thereabouts.

However, this year has been a lot of bad personal health news. Burnout hit me in spring, which led to depression despite weekly counseling/therapy, and me realizing somewhat recently that I was starting to have suicidal thoughts got me hauling ass to a psychiatrist a few days ago. He's put me on meds (welbutrin and concerta - turns out I had minor ADHD as well), and also drew my blood to make sure there weren't other physiological issues causing depression.

As it turns out, my figures are not normal. I'm apparently pre-diabetic, my cholesterol is high, and I am severely lacking in vitamin D.

End preface

I went running a couple days ago for the first time in months. Actually running instead of just literally shuffling my feet and mentally bitching and moaning and physically sighing. I did a 6km loop around a few blocks in my neighborhood, an almost perfect rectangle. I attribute this to the meds somewhat, as well as the very sub-optimal health diagnosis.

As mentioned above, I'd like some tips for how to set goals or milestones so I can maintain this newfound momentum.

One thing I've noticed as I went running the other day was that a little bit of gamification helped. Those who have played open-world video games may know what I'm talking about - I visualized signs for various landmarks and stores, and imagined an arbitrary distance going down as I get close to them.

As for the other issues, I've already implemented a preliminary game plan - watching and logging what I eat, eliminating added sugar, cutting down on processed foods, continuing counseling/therapy - while I wait for my follow-up appointment with my doc in two weeks.

I'd love to hear what others in my boat have been doing. Short, daily runs? Psych for a longer run a week? Something else?",1698200986.0,

There would be some racks with all the fancy attachments for chin ups, wall balls, safety bars, benches etc. Lots of bars of all kinds and plates, a full set of kettlebells and dumbbells too. Medicine balls and sandbags of different sizes and shapes All of this would be anti-rust of course.  Maybe with watertight storage boxes for the weights and bars.

The main section would be open to the elements. A prowler sled track, a space for doing shuttle runs, t'ai chi and other moving around exercises. Something about the size of a tennis court.

Pictures too if you like.",9,17bdunk,5,"The ""best"" gym I have been in was when I lived in Wolverhampton here in the UK. It was a traditional boxing gym with some free weights in the corner.

Not to put too fine a point on it, it stank. There were no toilets or changing rooms. You arrived in your workout clothes and went home in them or you changed in the far corner with everyone in there whistling and yelling. If you were there at the end of the evening session you would help sweep the floor and pack stuff away. If you went early in the morning you helped set everything up.

They had two rings, all the usual heavy bags, speedballs etc, space for shadow boxing and bodyweight exercises, It was all basic and patched up with duct tape but we didn't care. Everyone who went in there was there to work and to sweat.
The only time we stopped working hard was to watch a round in the sparring rings. You worked and you worked. The head trainer and his staff saw to that. 

The camaraderie was off the scale. If someone had a competition fight we all went to cheer them on if we could. We had one guy fighting for the British title while I was there. A coach took us to watch in London. 

Newcomers would be looked after too. Shown how to bind their hands and pick gloves that would protect them. Once the head coach was satisfied that they would be able to defend themselves in the ring he would put them in with someone.

Its not surprising as the 21st century is a stressful time to live in. Multiple crises and wars at global level and an economy that doesn't work in many countries are just the start.

Its also harder for people to get professional help for their mental health problems. Availability and cost are very big limiting factors for many people.

So what can we do? Well we can exercise. That is why we are all here after all.

There is something more important than that and its far more effective in my view. We can be kind. That's it. We can be kind to our loved ones, family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances and even random strangers both on line and in the real world.

This doesn't mean giving every de-homed person in the local tent city a thousand units of currency. It can be doing all the weekend chores as your partner has had a really bad week at work. It can mean calling your sister as she is going through a tough time. It can be meeting a friend for lunch to catch up. It can mean asking a colleague if they are ok when they are under pressure at work. It can mean smiling at a small child sat in the trolley at the supermarket (**always** be kind to small children) It can be helping an elderly person work out how to use the new ATM machine at the bank when you are next in line. If you see something on line you find offensive don't start an argument instead think about your position and the other persons position and whether a calm, more reasoned debate is possible.

There are hundreds of opportunities to be kind every day. Try and take as many of them as you can. You will make the world a better place and make yourself a better person too.",1697530325.0,

Also whatever I say my teen tells me that none of it is news. And I know that too. I say I am impressed with how many coping strategies they already learned, and they say that they only know one coping strategy and that is suck it up and do it, and that does not always work. I say depression lies. And my teen tells me that that depression is part of me though. And I agree, but I say that part of oneself lies to us though.

Depression and perfectionism feed off each other, a depressed perfectionist is one’s own worst critic, and we can be vicious in our self assessment finding ourselves wanting, pointing out even small unimportant flaws and shortcomings, plus there is the danger of dismissing small improvements and small steps in the right direction as not good enough - since we cannot be perfect why even bother starting or trying.

Chremebomb,Need advice on how to start exercising lower body with my circumstances,6,175jidz,9,"Hi everyone!

I want to decrease the fat and build muscle on my lower body. I feel very unhappy and uncomfy with my lower body. I have had success eating in a caloric deficit. Nutrition isn't my problem, exercise is. I'm 34F, 171 cm and weigh 62kgs.

For reasons I don't want to elaborate on, I can't go to the gym (debilitating mental health issues; tried (different) gyms three times, didn't work out each time). I have admitted defeat (i.e. no gym for now) and have tried to find a routine that I can do and that works with my mental health at home. I saw the bodyweight subreddit, but I'm genuinely too depressed and low energy (started a new job while maintaining mental health) to work through all the instructions (I tried for a couple weeks and it stressed me out a lot).

My question now: I saw so many people's progress pics and when I asked them, many of them said they neither followed a strict routine nor did they go to the gym or read up a lot about what which exercise did. Can I just start doing video workouts for lower body (Apple Fitness Plus/Youtube routines/other) without having researched what each exercise does/trains, without a personal trainer to tell me what to do, without much knowledge?

I've been too OCD to just start doing that, and I desperately want to talk to somebody about this. I really wish I could get started exercising for my lower body, I just need a number of exercises and to know it's okay to just do them. One of the dudes supposed to help me at one of the gyms started me on some core exercises, then left me hanging. And anytime I try to start a conversation about this I'm told ""we're not mental health professionals"" - which is correct and I agree, but I just want some pointers if it makes sense to do that or if I really need a tight sitting routine and some overseeing…

And I want visible change, too. As in, I want my bum to not be flabby anymore but look nicer and be tighter, and I want my legs to be less flabby too. I know I’m in this for the long haul and a lifestyle change. I’m up for it. I just can’t go to the gym or afford a personal trainer right now and I really need to talk to somebody about this - it’s really making me super unhappy, and my therapist isn’t very helpful here (with tips on how to circumnavigate this issue).

rob_cornelius,My World Mental Health Day workout,7,174fqal,2,"Tl;DR I did it and it didn't hurt too much

I haven't touched my kettlebells since the late summer of 2020. I basically stopped strength training for a long time apart from a break when I was staying at my in-laws and going to the gym every day was a good way to get some time to myself.

##How I felt before I started 

I have to say I was a little anxious before I started. I haven't done that type of workout for so long. I knew what I had to do and had planned out my reps and sets in my head but... what if I had lost more strength than I thought, what if I hurt myself. All the usual anxieties I guess. I had already decided to modify some of the lifts I would normally do and cut out snatches entirely.

The 10th of October is also the anniversary of my worst ever breakdown which saw me winding up on a psych ward for a while. Its never my favourite time of year because of that. A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then and while I don't think I will ever be quite as bad as that again its always in the back of my mind especially today.

##Equipment used

As well as a kettlebells I like to use a few other things to work out with. So my list of equipment is as follows. I also work out in my back yard so I am a little limited, I try to think creatively to overcome those limitations

* 20kg kettlebell
* length of heavy chain that weighs about 15kgs
* 3kg kettlebell
* a rock that weighs about 8-10kg

I did say I like to use different things to most to work out didn't I? ;-)

##Program

Quick warm up. Jogging on the spot, a few stretches

* 50 x kettlebell swings with the 20kg bell. 10 x double handed swings, 20 x single handed swings, All done without stopping.
* 40 x OHP with the chains 20 on each side, again with no stopping
* 40 x cleans with the 20kg bell, 20 per hand again no stopping
* 30 x goblet squats with the 20kg bell

I had a minute or two between exercises to get my breath back. Now I had  a longer break and a drink of water.

* 40 x bicep curls with the rock. in sets of 10 and changing my grip on the rock each set
* 40 x overhead triceps extensions with the chain hanging from an old length of rebar
* 20 x side raises with the rock
* 20 x front raises with the rock
* 20 x rear raises with the rock
* 40 x deadlifts with the 20kg kettlebell

again have a longer break and a drink

* 40 x press ups 20 x normal and 20x pike press ups
* Plank with moving the 3kg kettlebell around with alternating hands... hard to describe

Drink of water and then into an ice cold shower.

##How I felt at the time. 

There was a real mix of things. For some exercises I was quite pleased that I could manage them better than I anticipated. Others were tough. The front raises especially. I also struggled to maintain focus. I was continually thinking on chores that need doing in the yard. I got distracted watching a spider in its huge web.

I didn't get the rush of happy brain chemicals. I rarely do when I lift anyway. What I did get was a good feeling of achieving something. I gave myself a task and I did It. I didn't back out, in fact I could have done more.

##How I feel now

Its about an hour after I finished. The cold shower has set me up nicely. I am wide awake and feeling like I can make progress at work. I would say that it was a really good thing to do.

##For the future.

I am going to mix strength and cardio training up again. I realised how much I missed picking up heavy things and swinging them around before putting them down again.

If we work with our mental health issues we will likely to have at least some success. We accept that things don't go the way they ""should"". We listen to what is going on and we move with it.

It is very easy to be rigid and inflexible when we exercise. Reps and sets, times, distances etc. If we don't make it to the stop of the Strava leaderboard for that run we feel bad. If we can't get that last rep of a set we feel bad. If we feel like shit and can't get out of bed we feel even worse because we missed our workout too.

Exercise shows us that we can do things and get them right. It doesn't matter what the exercise is. Five kneeling push ups or a short walk to the end of the road and back when you are having a bad day is an major achievement. On a really bad day getting out of bed counts too. You did something positive and you did it right.

That micro-victory counts as much as a full on workout when your mental health issues are more manageable. In fact its not a micro-victory its a victory full stop. Any victory is a cause for celebration. (Go easy on the cream cakes for a celebration though). Celebrate getting something done. Put a big red X on todays date on the calendar.

JoannaBe,How to remember to take medicine,2,16v9w1p,5,"This is related to EOOD because many of us are on antidepressant /anti anxiety meds, but also some of us are on other medicines which may influence our wellbeing and ability to manage our mental and physical health, including our ability to exercise. Also I think those of us who struggle with mental health are more likely to have memory issues.

I have been recently struggling with forgetting to take my medicines which I take in the morning and in the evening, and especially my Zoloft and the high blood pressure meds it really makes a difference in my well being if I forgot to take them.

So here is what I have come up with so far: for morning I am trying to establish a new routine that when I get up in the morning to go to the bathroom I take my pill box with me and hold on to it until I have taken the meds. That helps with morning but not evening.

For evening I just thought to put the meds in the morning somewhere where they will be in the way before bedtime, so that I have to move them out of the way to do something which I already do every evening. I just thought of that since yesterday evening I forget my meds, so don’t know yet how well this will work.

Do any others of you have things that have worked for you to reduce the chance of forgetting medicines? For me alarms on my phone do not work, too easy to ignore, plus if I am not near my meds and busy a particular time may not work and in half an hour I might forget.

I've been lifting weights and doing cardio on and off for like a decade now.  That part is easy for me, it's one of the only things in my life that I look forward to lately (most of the time). However, my mood and drive has dropped off a cliff in the past year or so.  I'm doing HIIT camps at least 3 times a week and I love it - but I am unable to get myself eating properly to handle this level of physical effort.  As a result, my mood just gets worse and I often feel like garbage physically and mentally. I think protein specifically is where I have issues.  

I know 'just eat more meat!' I've been there and have done it successfully for years in the past. Now, I find prepping and cooking meat especially draining, and making it actually palatable takes more energy than I am capable of most days.  It's at the point where I just eat junk to satiate myself instead. I try to eat junk with protein (like a high protein cereal with protein heavy milk) but I am definitely still not getting enough, even with a protein shake thrown in.  I try to eat tuna packets, but I hate the stuff.  I end up usually shoveling as much into my mouth as possible then washing it back with water without thinking about it. I actually do that with a lot of foods, just to get the nutrients into me.  It isn't enjoyable lol.  I used to eat a lot of greek yogurt, but it's nearing $8 a tub now, and I can go through a tub a day easily. Many days, I get maybe ~80g-100g of protein when I need closer to 170g. I know this needs to be a priority for me, but I have so many other things going on in life that no matter how much I intend to fix my diet, it just never actually happens. 

So basically, does anyone have any tips on high protein foods with little to no prep involved?  Something like plain Greek yogurt (I think I am going to just eat the cost and put that back into my diet) that I can just grab and start eating.

JoannaBe,A useful definition of happiness,9,16s8we2,1,"A week ago Rob posted on here a link to the article about Matthieu Ricard who wrote the book “Happiness,” and based on that I ordered the book and it arrived today.

So far I have not read far yet, but I like Matthieu Ricard’s definition of happiness in chapter 1 “By happiness I mean here a deep sense of flourishing that arises from an exceptionally healthy mind. This is not a mere pleasurable feeling, a fleeting emotion, or a mood, but an optimal state of being. Happiness is also a way of interpreting the world, since while it may be difficult to change the world, it is always possible to change the way we look at it.”

I really like that definition. It sounds actionable. Not easy of course, but I can imagine over time making progress toward such happiness, and I would really like to try. I will see what the book offers in terms of advice of how to learn this skill.

Edit: further on still in chapter 1 “Happiness is the purging of mental toxins, such as hatred and obsession, that literally poison the mind. It is also about learning how to put things in perspective and reduce the gap between appearances and reality. To that end we must acquire a better knowledge of how the mind works and more accurate insights into the nature of things, for in the deepest sense, suffering is intimately linked to a misapprehension of the nature of reality.”",1695688127.0,

I’m approaching my 40th birthday, and I think my midlife crisis is that I’m overweight, I’m depressed, I don’t like to exercise, and I love the taste of terrible food.

I don’t like living like this, and I know I’m running full steam ahead to an early grave. I want to be healthy, I want to enjoy exercising, and I want to lose weight. But as it says in my title, I’ve tried and failed more times than I really have counted.

Every exercise program I find intimidates me. Diets don’t sound appealing. Every website I find on Google all give me wildly different answers about what to do. 

I was convinced at a young age that the best way to lose weight was to run. All that does for me anymore is make me exhausted and eat up time. And it’s clearly not sustainable if I do it for a couple weeks, then quit. 

So now I’m asking you, what would work best for someone like me? I’m (roughly) 50 pounds overweight, depressed, and looking for the most efficient and sustainable way to exercise out of depression. I’m tired of living like this.

Thanks in advance!",1695402205.0,
rob_cornelius,"If you are thinking on starting out with exercise you should know about ""Noob gains""",24,16p5jju,0,"Noob/newb gains are a well known and documented phenomenon in many forms of exercise. Basically when someone starts exercising they improve very quickly for a while. After a while their rate of improvement slows down but they still improve.

My personal pet theory backed up with no science what so ever is that people tend to underestimate their abilities and fitness before they start. That means when they do start they are pleasantly surprised that they are more capable than they thought and progress rapidly. After a while expectations come more in line with reality and things settle down.

So if you are thinking on starting exercise you are probably going to get a big boost to your confidence and self-esteem as you will see changes quickly.

now i just came back from a 6km bike ride. the wind was strong which is why that's the best i could do. i can't bring myself to be happy about it, my thoughts are just ""6km is nothing"", ""now do pilates and lift weights until your muscles ache so it wasn't a complete waste"". the only positive thing is now i don't have to be anxious i haven't exercised today.

kastiveg1,The symbiosis of exercise and mental health goals,3,16feooq,1,"I've always known that I should learn to deal with my stress, my anxiety, to eat better and to take my health more seriously. But it wasn't until my training stalled out that I noticed how much my habits outside of the gym were interfering with my results. I believe that it was this insight that pushed my motivation enough to deal with my stress, eating cleaner foods and get more organised.

Consider the presence of stress in your life. Most of us know deep inside that the omnipresent stressors in our lives take a toll on our mental health, and that the endless scrolling and staying inside is making us unhappy. Be it laziness, a lack of self-worth or a lack of self-discipline, sometimes we know full well what we need to do to be happier, but we decide it just isn't worth the effort right now. We all have a bar for what it takes to feel it's rewarding enough to start making life changes. If you're close to doing it for the sake of your own well being, external goals might just just add that little bit more that gets you clearly over the bar.

Once you see how much stress, doubt and excuses interfere with your training and decide to do something about it to get stronger or faster, your strive for self-accomplishment will take a free ride on the back of your training aspirations. Once you prioritise getting your x amount of hours of working out per week, you'll have no choice but to plan your weeks to ensure that that time is allocated. Get serious enough about your training and watch yourself give up drinking excessively, stopping giving excuses for bad sleep, get motivated to reduce your chronic stress levels and overall lead a better life. All the things you deep inside know you need to do for your inner peace, but that you might not find the intrinsic motivation for.

At least for me, I've found that striving for my fitness goals just so happens to automatically make me advocate and root for my mental health, social relations and general physical health. Because being stressed and feeling alone is terrible for recovery from exercise, just like sleeping poorly, eating poorly and not taking yourself seriously. 

The long term goal should obviously be to achieve the sense of self worth that gives you internal motivation to better yourself. But it that's hard for you; your exercise performance, be it weight lifting, cardio or sports, will be a good surrogate for your mental health goals. Your body, just like your mind, is unpredictable and one day you may get sick or have a bad injury. If your only motivation for betterment is your fitness goals, you might find that a physical performance setback feels like an equally large blow to your life as a whole. Orthorexia and body dysmorphia are powerful forces of destruction and if you let your athletic abilities be a proxy for your self-worth and personality, you might be in the risk zone for developing some coping mechanisms that are adaptive to your short term physical goals, but not your mental.

Now, exercise isn't magic. Non-athletic goals will have many of these same benefits. Needing to be sharp for a new job might give you a lot of motivation for getting to bed in time, but the connection to controlling your weight might not be as obvious as if you're trying to do more pull ups or to climb a harder wall (not overeating), or to reach your bench press or deadlift goal (eating enough). Deciding to finally search for your dream job might make you get up in time, but you might also find yourself giving excuses for being constantly stressed out.

The thing that I believe that separates exercise from other goals is that it's a positive feedback loop in ways that most other goals aren't. Training for a 20 minute 5k absolutely necessitates you going out frequently to do cardio. These cardio sessions will increase the production of hormones necessary for having the motivation to run, but also to be calmer and more social. Squats and deadlifts will increase your conversion from serum testosterone to free testosterone and increase your ghrelin, enabling you to squat, deadlift and eat even more, once again increasing the relevant hormones and so on.

I'm also going with a friend, and it's abroad with the flights and accommodation all booked all ready.

It's in November so I have a while still (to train... but also to worry).

I was going to fundraise for a charity but I think that that has freaked me out more now cos once I do that I am fully committed and it would be so embarrassing if I didn't do it.

I think I'm worried that something will get in the way of me doing it - my mental health really. And so then I get into this spiral of worrying that my mental health will get in the way. Which is obviously stupid and unhelpful.

I know I am being so silly.

I had some really rough times last year where I needed time off work, and I guess I worry that might happen again. The marathon is also around the same time of year when my mental health declined last year.

Kwadratus,6 months later,17,1602v1h,13,"Hey guys,

It's been a while and a lot happened in that time. The first 2 months were pretty successful for me. I hit the gym 3 times a week, mostly for the courses and sometimes for a full body workout I found online and I thought ""Man, you made it, you really stick to it, awesome"". 

People around me noticed that something has changed and asked me if I lost weight and gained some muscles instead which boosted my confidence a lot and motivated me to continue everything. When I started half a year ago, the scale laughed at me with a whooping 105Kg. 3 months later the scale showed 93Kg which is huge albeit a bit too much of a weight loss in that amount of time I guess?  I drank a lot of protein shakes and quit the snacks like a bag of chips or a pizza at midnight. Seems that I was less hungry than usual and my hunger attacks were less too. I guess this is the effect of working out that my metabolism stabilized a lot and protected me from overeating.

I took some pics of myself front and sideview, hoping to see progress over time to motivate me even more but after 2 months, I didn't see that much difference in my posture or the size of my belly, in fact I had the feeling my lordosis and tilted pelvis got worse than before but I might be wrong here, at least other people noticed a change and that felt good.

About May, I fell into a depression again and I noticed that working out was turning into a huge chore. I just sat there at the machines I've been using for weeks and just stared at the floor. My head was like ""Dude, what are you doing? Do your reps already!"" but I just couldn't. Started one excercise and after 3 reps I just felt like ""I can't do this. There is no way I will do the next rep"". Not because a lack of strenght but motivation. The intrusive spiral hit me hard, why am I even doing this? I will get old and weak eventually and then die so what is the point of even giving a shit about my body and my health in general if everything will end anyway?

Why am I trying to be fit and healthy if I am 35 and soon will be an old man, my teenage years are over, my young adult years are over, there are no parties anymore, no cute girls look at me anymore because I am just too old. I felt betrayed by the world and out of place. While the young 20 year old ripped guys were surrounded by everyone, they just look at me and think ""lol, look at this granpa trying to get ripped haha.""

And it went on and on and on. One week without working out. Just casually walking through a park. No one notices me. I'm 1.92m tall. No one looks at me, small children just run past by me without even try to dodge my appearance, like I am just an obligatory structure in the park like a rock or a tree you may notice but it is so casual and mundane that your perception just blends it out.

2 weeks, 3... 1 month. Didn't hit the gym in that time. It is June, summer time. The guys are running around in the park all looking good. I am wearing a sweater and sloppy pants to hide my fat and bend body. Sweating like a piece of shit and think that I just stink away everyone. Sat on park benches for literally hours, no one notices me, no one even walks by and says ""Hello"". Even the ducks didn't care for my existence and walked by or even sat next to my leg because I just was so uninteresting to them they don't even have the fear I might do anything bad to them.

Now it is today. The scale shows 97kg. I don't feel hungry but I am eating all day. Nothing seems to make me stuffed. Pizza? Yeah, one large pizza. 20 minutes later I eat a bag of chips. 2 hours later the oven goes on again because I bought a triple pack of pizza. Inbetween I find bread and think ""Yeah, could eat that too"".

I see the spiral going down again and feel helpless and just watch it happen passively. There is no reason to hit the gym, even the way to it feels like lightyears away and a chore.

What am I going to do? I really don't know how to continue this. My back hurts because as soon as I wake up, my ass is in front of the computer playing videogames for 16 hours and then go to sleep at 6 in the morning just top wake up at 4 o'clock in the afternoon to repeat the day before, and the day before that.

rob_cornelius,Katerina Johnson-Thompson won gold in the hepathlon at the World Athletics championships,3,15xzko6,0,"That title on the face of it doesn't mean a lot. KJT (as she is known) has been through a lot both physically and mentally over her athletics career. There is an article in the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/21/katarina-johnson-thompson-coach-put-her-through-a-lot-of-pain-world-championships-athletics) which talks about some of this.

She has ruptured her achilles tendon then tore the calf muscle on the other leg leading to her exiting the last Olympics in a wheel chair. She has talked freely about her anxiety too. Its easy to see she is very anxious before the start of an event.

The article talks about how she suffered anxiety during training and even during a race where she felt like she would die if she pushed hard enough to win. Her new coach much be as much a psychologist as a coach as he seems to have taught her to overcome this anxiety. So much so that she beat her Personal Best/Record in the 800m by two whole seconds to take gold.

Many of us think ""I can't do that, its too much"", when we exercise. I sometimes get like this when I am on my rowing machine. Suddenly that though pops into my head and I just stop. I know that I can row the distance easily but a mental block descends. 

Pushing to improve physically is an important part of exercise. To be more physically capable we have to be more mentally capable. Seeing physical progress gives us more self-confidence and self-esteem, which mental health problems steal from us, enabling us to keep going even further. One backs up the other. We prove to ourselves we can overcome our problems, both physical and mental through exercise.

Of course we are not perfect. We will skip a workout or two or three. There is no point in beating ourselves up about it though. Just get back on the horse when you can. You will still get there.

For those of us that are getting more advanced in years there is good advice from her coach too. KJT doesn't have the spring in her step that she used to thanks to those injuries. That means she is placing less emphasis on the high and long jump events and more on the throwing events and the 800m. I think that's something that makes sense. If you get older and find one sort of exercise is not for us anymore then try something else.",1692693315.0,
JoannaBe,It’s ok to miss a day or week,26,15x5lit,5,"During the three days of high stress and two days of recovery I did not track my calories at all, walked much less, and only did a couple of yoga workouts. Today I weighed myself and I am within a pound of what I weighed a week ago which is fine. I am restarting monitoring my calorie intake today (I am in maintenance, not aiming to loose weight but also not to gain.)

In the calorie counting community some people claim that one absolutely has to monitor everything one eats every single day. That is nonsense in my opinion, a day or even a few days of not monitoring will not break the long term pattern irreparably. Just like with exercise, missing a day or a week of exercise is not going to have a huge impact on progress. It is the long term pattern that matters. 

If one makes a habit of not watching how much one eats or not exercising regularly for a prolonged time then it can become a problem. But a day or a week is not a big deal in the long term. 

We need to allow ourselves some leeway: when life gets too difficult it is ok for something to give for the time being, perfectionism is not helpful and just leads to more stress and a sense of failure that is disproportional to the actual impact the worse days would have on us without the perfectionism making it much worse.",1692619170.0,

ajv1993,In a Complete Fitness Rut (and How to Get Out of It),5,15tcwo4,2,"For the past few months, I have been a rut. I have been going less and less to the gym and have gone a whole month without logging in my food intake (I use MyFitnessPal). Before I used  to go 3-4 times a week, and log in everything I consumed. Now I only go once or twice a month. I still weigh my food but often forget or procrastinate in logging it in MFP.

Before when I would get bored of a routine, I would try to find new things to do. Like, trying a new workout routine, setting a new goal, decreasing or increasing my calorie intake. But even now I have no passion to do any of it.

Not being financially secure has put a huge damper on my self esteem and motivation. Especially since I always figured I would have my career now but am having trouble even finding a job. Even though I already have my degrees and some work experience/skills. Everything else feels insignificant in comparison. 

I have gained a lot of the weight that I had lost 4-5 years prior back and that has also added to the discouragement. But I don't want to give up. I want to go back to feeling confident and fitting into some of my favorite clothes. I also want to go back to enjoying weightlifting and counting calories (because that is what helped me tremendously). 

I also thought that maybe upping my Wellbutrin dosage would help but am unsure since a lot of my current issues are situational, as I am more likely to be healthier and happier when I have income coming in. Hopefully that happens soon.

It's been like this for the last 5 months or so. It's worrying me that it could be that my depression is getting worse. I can see a beautiful girl and appreciate that, but there's nothing else. Nada. 

When I was looking into lowered libido related to depression, I was seeing some references to exercise improving depression-created libido issues. Is anyone's experience of this true?

Is it more that the depression gets better due to the exercise, which then has a knock-on effect to the libido,  or is there something synaptically/chemically effective specifically for a low libido that exercise provides?

My name is Lana Bojanić and I am a research assistant and PhD candidate at the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Safety in Mental Health (NCISH) at the University of Manchester. 

As a part of my doctoral research under the supervision of Dr Isabelle Hunt, I am conducting a study on **people with suicidal thoughts/behaviours who use the internet in the UK**. Insights from this study aim to be used to inform and improve patient safety and care. 

This study aims to recruit people in contact with mental health services to share their experiences with suicidality and the internet and provide insight into how the two interact and create potential risks and benefits. 

I believe that the experiences of people in contact with mental health services are necessary to obtain an accurate picture of the clinical and internet environment they are in. 

Please consider sharing your experiences in this survey if you are eligible using this link [https://www.qualtrics.manchester.ac.uk/jfe/form/SV\_86yZjYSqTMzS086](https://www.qualtrics.manchester.ac.uk/jfe/form/SV_86yZjYSqTMzS086).

deepbluesteve,Getting Started Feels Impossible,5,15kwncv,8,"I've been managing depression with varying levels of success for 30 years (I'm nearing 40). I'm still alive, so I guess that's success?

Anyway, my therapist and I have been discussing exercise lately and I realize I really, really, really need to start moving my body and getting my heart rate up.

However, I have a major block on exercise and I really don't know how to get started.

The main reasons are that:

1. I hate exercising indoors--gyms are hard for me because I don't know what I'm doing, I have some really bad social anxiety, and I don't have much money to spend.  We have a treadmill, but it is in the bedroom--which is great for my wife who uses it later in the day. I can't really use it because she would be woken when I work out. I don't have another place in the house to put it.
2. I LOVE outdoor hiking and that would be an automatic ticket to getting exercise--but where I live is pretty much free from such things as forests and water and elevation and anything enjoyable for a hike. This is really what I truly want, but it's not possible. I currently am able to travel for 2-3 days once a year somewhere for a hiking trip--I look forward to it every year. I'd be SO happy to have something close by.
3. I live in a part of the country that hasn't been below 105 degree highs for weeks, and the mornings (the only time I have to exercise) it is already above 90. One hallmark of my depression is that hot summers really get me very down. It's like SAD, but in the summer instead of the winter.  The heat lasts from mid-May to mid-October. (Side note: I desperately want to move but cannot justify moving my wife and two elementary age kids when they're pretty happy here. She owns a successful business, the kids are doing well in school, etc.)
4. I'm a dad with a job (5 days in office, 45-minute commute) that is also primarily responsible for getting the kids off to school and dinner time after work. This means that in order to exercise, I now need to get up an hour earlier and go to bed an hour earlier... I'm not a morning person generally and my wife doesn't like to go to bed until later... so I feel like I'll be trading my sleep for exercise. This wouldn't be an issue on Saturday and Sunday, but I don't think exercising those two days would be sufficient to get the benefit.  I've been trying to find a WFH job for months, and even though I'm in IT (infrastructure, not a developer), I can't find a job that isn't full time in the office or hybrid with a long commute.

It just feels so impossible. I know some of these are probably false barriers. It's just overwhelming.

Luckily, I'm in okay-ish shape (6ft 180lbs), but I feel like if I don't get in a good exercise routine, my depression is going to continue to get worse and my health will deteriorate as I age.",1691441407.0,

Yesterday and this morning was refinishing. Carefully working over every inch of the floor with the finishing product, using a 2 inch foam brush. Knee pads, just wear knee pads. Its looking really good though after two coats and there is enough left for a third if it needs it.

It might be the fumes from the finishing product but I feel better mentally now than I have done in ages. Having to take the time to do a slow methodical job while listening to the radio has kind of hit reset in my mind. Nothing else to worry about apart from not missing a bit and keeping the finish even.

There was even some exercise in there too. I had to do quite a few one handed planks when I was reaching to get to some areas without touching where I had previously applied the finish.

I have really enjoyed a couple of days of fairly hard physical work.",1691142647.0,

MrJare,"Exercise never felt good, even when it was regular",8,15egn02,4,"I've been getting back into working out regularly again after a nearly year-long hiatus (read: debilitating depression). It's been per-recommendation of my new psychiatrist who said I should be exercising regularly for my mood (and I mean, he's probably right).

&#x200B;

The problem for me is that exercise was never enjoyable, or fun, or accomplishing.   


I was probably in the best shape I'd ever been in 2022. For about a year and a half straight I'd run regularly, went to the gym four days a week, do yoga every day, and lost a lot of weight. I also hated every second of it. I'd tried tons of different variations of everything I did. I'd run slower, faster, listen to music, cycle through different exercises; and I always felt miserable afterwards. I'd feel lethargic and tired and unmotivated. I'd never care about the progress I was making. I never felt any sort of accomplishment after the fact and working out was just something I did because I had to.   


Yoga was probably the closest to enjoying anything exercise-related, but it was mostly the novelty of it. Once it became habitual it started feeling like a chore like everything else.  


Fast-forward to today and I've been working out for about a month after a long break. In terms of attitude towards exercise, it's pretty much the same except for the fact that I messed up my foot sometime last year and running is unbearable with the pain. Holding a lot of yoga poses is considerably harder than before as well. If I hated exercise then, I *really* hate it now. It's made me feel pretty cynical about how exercise is viewed, and the whole ""just keep trying until you find something like you like"" attitude has felt kinda fruitless.  


A lot of this very well may be an attitude problem with how I view working out. I just don't know where this leaves me. There is no avenue I've found that makes exercise not perpetuate my depression/anxiety. I'm open to any and all suggestions. I've hit a roadblock on how to solve it. ",1690811084.0,

rob_cornelius,Touching grass or getting out into green space is important for our mental health,21,153182g,1,"A quick google search will give you hundreds of studies saying getting out into nature is good for our mental health. You will find plenty of studies that say exercising outdoors in a green space is better than in a nice air-conditioned gym too.

I am lucky that I live in a small town in very rural Hampshire. One of the best trout fishing rivers in the world flows through the middle of the town and where the town stops and Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty starts. (that means an area recognised for is beauty and wildlife that is protected under law here in the UK). I grew up and spent the majority of my life in another beautiful part of South West England.

I have lived and worked in cities in the past. I always tried to find some nature in my day. I would walk half a mile out of my way to go through a park that was really a desert with nothing but grass and a few sorry looking trees sandwiched between a railway line and a busy road. It was known by all the locals as ""dog shit park"" as it was that bad. It was still green though.

I had a job in London for a while. I would walk down to the Thames embankment and watch birds in my lunch hour. Did you know the [fastest birds in the world live in London?](http://www.london-peregrine-partnership.org.uk/) You can spot them chasing pigeons around the tower blocks. Its the same in many cities around the world. Peregrines are really widespread globally. Out in the wild they nest on cliffs but tower blocks make a good alternative and there are always lots of pigeons to eat in cities.

Its only a cliché because its true but seeing a plant thriving in the cracks in the pavement can bring a tiny glimmer of hope on a shitty day. Tiny little plants like mosses can live almost unnoticed literally under our feet. I vividly recall crying for joy when I spotted thousands of pyramidal orchids growing amongst the grass on the side of the highway when I was stuck in a traffic jam. I had sped by them for days and not noticed them. 

More googling and you will find that growing things and especially getting your hands dirty is really good for your mental health, even the smell of freshly dug soil releases all kinds of happy brain chemicals. Even if its a plant in a pot on your windowsill its better than nothing.

Many local communities have volunteer schemes where people do their best to brighten their local environment. Our town has a litter picking day on a Saturday. You turn up at 9am, get given trash bags and gloves and a street or two in the town to tidy up and away you go. Community gardens, orchards, allotments and the like are increasingly common. There is also [guerrilla gardening](http://www.guerrillagardening.org/) where you basically unofficially adopt a patch of land that is going to waste and plant flowers or even fruits and vegetables. Take it further and you wind up with [incredible edible](https://www.incredibleedible.org.uk/) which was started by two people in a town here in the UK or the [community gardens](https://www.grownyc.org) in New York City. 

You take it further in terms of exercise too. I spent many Sundays when I was a student trying to eradicate invasive rhododendrons from woodland when I was a student. We were volunteers so we were not allowed tractors, chainsaws or other power tools. That meant lots of heavy manual labour instead with hand saws, axes, come along winches and the like before dragging the felled material together to make big bonfires. We would go home exhausted and literally covered in mud from head to toe but with huge grins on our faces. It's one of the best forms of exercise I can think of.

papaya-cube,Exercise Induced Anxiety,20,152lg5t,12,"Hey all,

I recently started working out again after taking a couple years off.

I suffer from panic disorder, but haven't had an anxiety attack for several years. I thought I beat my anxiety until I started going to the gym again...

While working out I feel great.
I'm 28, female, have chronic illness, and I'm pretty out of shape following a long term hospitalization last year. I push myself, but never to the point of discomfort. I build up to around 130-140bpm during cardio by brisk walking (which should be fine for my age) and then I do weights and another cooldown of less intense cardio.

I want to stress that working out makes me feel really good. I love it. I'm not pushing myself hard enough that anything feels bad. I'm out of shape, but this is how I fix that, right?

But after the gym, things take a turn.
For hours after my workout, my heart rate stays above 110, even lying down. It'll go down to 96 with lots of deep breathing, and then shoot right back up to 115 because I said something aloud or moved slightly.
I also feel weak, anxious, and a sense of impending doom that basically turns every gym day into a perpetual nightmare where nothing can get done afterwards but lying down and desperately trying to relax.

My normal resting heart rate is around 70-75, which is on the high side of average for my age and sex. I want to disclose that I do have anxiety tied to my heart and heart rate, especially since my hospital stay.

I have an appointment with my doctor, but not for a few months. I really don't want to quit working out, but I don't know how to beat my exercise induced anxiety.

rob_cornelius,I have been trying to write this post for some time - experiencing mental health issues can be the only response to events in your life.,27,14xq0bi,5,"We all have times in our lives where we come under enormous pressure. Breakups, Divorces, Death of a Loved One, Marriages, Financial Troubles, Moving House, Losing your Job are generally seen as the big ones. It is *natural* to be stressed and anxious about moving house. The death of someone close to you is depressing as is losing your job. Divorce is often devastating. Sometimes a ""happy"" even like the birth of a child can have negative mental health effect. Post partum depression and even psychosis is a very real and dangerous thing, for men too.

No reasonable person would expect anyone to behave as ""normal"" if they are going through any of these events. Most good employers make allowances for their employees if they are going through something bad. When my father was first taken ill my then employer told me to take all the time I needed to look after him and my family. When he finally died in February my current employer was very generous and helpful too.

However it seems that our lives are increasingly well shitty in the 21st century. I won't go over the stresses we all face. Its too depressing (joke, I think). Medics now have a term for it all, [Shit Life Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit_life_syndrome).

As with most jokes there is a grain of truth in it. If your life is shit then experiencing mental health issues is part and parcel of your shit life. Its a never ending downwards spiral of doom. I have seen a meme a few times where apparently drugs manufacturers see this as proof that we need more medication and new forms of medication.

Why should we put up with a shit life that makes us unwell, physically and mentally. We all deserve better. We need help but better lives have got to be better than more medication to help us accept that the 21st century is a bit shit most of the time.",1689171823.0,

Open instagram or any ""fitness"" site and there are people selling gimmicky exercise routines, exercise machines and all the rest.

The thing is we don't need bulging muscles and a six pack. No one does. Trying to get a body like an influencer can be next to impossible, even before the lighting, filters and photoshop come out to play. 

Of course some jobs require a degree of physical strength. Construction work, livestock farmers and others. I used to deliver beer to pubs 30 years ago and while it helped to be strong it was more important to learn how *not* to lift a 50kg keg of beer than to lift it and hurt yourself. Kegs are round for a reason, they roll.

Most sports don't require a lot of strength. Weight and powerlifting, rugby, USian football, all the Olympic throwing events, sprint track cycling, some but by no means all martial arts are pretty much all I can't think of. 

Also big bulging muscles don't equate well with functional strength. Try arm wrestling a jockey and you will find out how a little guy who weighs half your bodyweight but is way stronger than he looks to find out about functional strength, ask me how I know...

So why does the big pecs, big arms and six pack look for men and a far more muscly and lean look for women dominate. I can't work out why.",1689182034.0,

anottakenusername,Severe Brain Fog and Fatigue Despite Progressing in My Workouts,27,14vrhsb,27,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

I've been working out consistently for the past three months and have encountered a frustrating issue: severe brain fog and fatigue, particularly after my workouts. I've been making great progress in terms of strength gains, adding 1-2 pounds to my compound lifts every week. My technique is solid, I experience no joint pain, and I find that the same number of reps per set feels easier than before, even managing to squeeze in a couple of extra reps while still leaving 2 reps in reserve.

&#x200B;

To give you some context, my diet is well-structured, and I track it diligently using Mike Israetel's RP Diet app. I consume four meals each day, and here's a breakdown of what they consist of:

&#x200B;

1. 1st meal @ 00:00: 40g protein, 20g fat, 60g carbs

   Bedtime @ 1:30am

2. 2nd meal @ 10:30am: 40g protein, 15g fat, 55g carbs

   Workout @ 12:30pm

3. 3rd meal: 40g protein, 15g fat, 95g carbs

4. 4th meal @ 19:00: 40g protein, 20g fat, 55g carbs

&#x200B;

I prioritize sleep and ensure I get a minimum of 7.5 hours of sleep each night. I rely on a sleep calculator that factors in sleep cycles, so on average, I sleep either 7.5 hours or 9 hours.

&#x200B;

My workout routine consists of four sessions per week. On Tuesdays, I focus on my back with two exercises:

1. Row movement: 4 sets of 8-15 reps

2. Pull-up movement: 4 sets of 8-15 reps

&#x200B;

Additionally, I perform two exercises for my chest:

1. Bench press: 4 sets of 8-12 reps

2. 45-degree bench dumbbell press: 4 sets of 8-12 reps

&#x200B;

For biceps, I do the following on a 45-degree angled bench:

1. Biceps exercise: 4-5 sets of 10-15 reps

2. Hammer biceps exercise: 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps

&#x200B;

On Wednesdays, it's lower body day, focusing on my legs:

1. Front squat: 4 sets of 6-10 reps

2. Leg press: 4 sets of 8-15 reps

3. Leg curls for hamstrings: 4 sets of 8-15 reps

&#x200B;

I take Thursdays as a rest day, and on Fridays and Saturdays, I repeat the same regimen as Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.

&#x200B;

During my workouts, I am usually able to maintain focus. However, when I struggle to concentrate, typically during the last set of an exercise or towards the end of the workout, I push myself to refocus. If I find it impossible to regain focus, I move on to the next exercise. In rare instances where this lack of focus persists, I simply walk home. This has occurred only once or twice within the three-month period, usually due to factors like a poor diet the day before, alcohol consumption, or inadequate sleep.

&#x200B;

It's worth mentioning that I intentionally leave at least one rep in reserve during every set of all my workouts, and on average, I aim to leave two reps in reserve. I have already completed one deload week during this three-month period.

&#x200B;

Despite all these efforts, I find myself lacking energy and motivation, feeling like a lifeless zombie. This has taken a toll on my mental health, and my depression has worsened due to the constant lack of energy.

&#x200B;

I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights you might have. I'm at a loss as to what might be causing this issue since I don't believe I'm overtraining or neglecting my diet, sleep, or recovery.

&#x200B;

Also, it's worth mentioning I'm currently running a maintenance diet, not deficit.

JoannaBe,Yin yoga as a healthy alternative to self harm,25,14qiskh,4,"For those of us who have at some point in our lives practiced some form of self harm: I don’t know about you, but I found that it did have some benefit in transferring the emotional and mental pain into more physical pain that I could handle better - alas it was not really worth it because I also knew that what I was doing was harming myself, and thus the guilt outweighed the perceived benefits.

Yin yoga is a type of yoga where one gets into a challenging stretch, to the limit of one’s flexibility, and then holds it for a slow sustained hold of 3-5 minutes, and then switches to another challenging posture like that and holds that for 3-5 minutes etc. It is definitely uncomfortable, and maybe even a bit painful though one should carefully assess to only stretch to the limit of one’s abilities and not further. It has the advantages of transferring one’s focus to the here and now and to the physical, and thus can shift that focus away from the mental and emotional. However, unlike with self harm there is no guilt because it is not harmful but rather is healthy for one’s connective tissue / ligaments / joints. Over time one becomes more flexible, can stretch further and thus it provides a sense of accomplishment.

I highly recommend yin yoga as a way of coping with anxiety and stress. Although I realize that it is not for everyone of course, and your experience may vary.",1688485720.0,

I decided to try them out when I hit one of the lowest points in my life. Then a year ago I rejoined a regular gym and have been going nearly everyday.

I still go on occasion but am no longer on the monthly plan. 

Recently I’ve been dealing with some golfers elbow the past couple months, so have had to take it easy on the lifting and progressive overload. Lighter weights, more reps for now. Kind of a bummer, but it’s important to listen to your body. I’m still able do HIIT style cardio running, rowing, assault bike, bike indoors and out, trail run. Alternate run days to give legs less impact. 

This past couple weeks as I decided to give myself a little break by not working out daily and doing less intense workouts, I could feel the mental challenges coming back on. But they didn’t last and I was able to overcome the sometimes crippling anxiety and depression and go on with my day. 

What I’ve learned the past two years is to stay consistent with some form of exercise and movement, regardless of what you choose. Make it habitual and it simply becomes part of who you are. Natural medicine for the body, mind, spirit and soul.

It struck me how they were using phrases like ""concentrate on what we can control"", ""Look for positives"", ""Focus on our strengths"", ""Analyse the opposition"", ""Resilient under pressure"" and many many more.

Cricket puts the players under a great deal of mental stress, especially the captains. Its not a coincidence that one of the best English captains of all time, Mike Brearley, was also a highly regarded therapist when he retired from playing cricket.

Well I had walked about a mile and there was a big lump of flint on the side of the path that a plough must have turned up. It was the roughly the same size and shape of a rugby ball. I picked it up. It weights about 12/15lbs at a guess.

I carried it home, a distance of about 4 or 5 miles. I could carry it in one hand with it resting against my hip *fairly* easily. There were a few irregularities that meant I could turn it around as I swapped hands to ease the various muscles in my hands and forearms. I even carried in the kettlebell rack position and resting on my shoulders.

It sound silly but its a really good way of getting some different exercise. Walking carrying a weight is always good. People put bricks in backpacks sometimes or have military style plate carriers and weighted vests to do that. 

Carrying an unbalanced weight even if it's not a big weight is trickier. It throws everything out, even the way your walk. It makes everything that bit harder. Thats a good thing in my book.

So EOOD land, what are your glimmers and why?

I guess I get to go first.

* Breaking a Personal Best
* Saying or doing the right thing when it would be easy to let my mental health issues take over and doing something I will come to regret.
* Seeing someone else do the best they can
* learning something new
* making a connection between two bits of knowledge that gives me an insight",1686826864.0,
mouthfuluv,sudden excruciating muscle soreness,9,14a26xz,4,"been working out for about 4 months now. did my usual routine. maybe even less. i just do body weight stuff like push ups, dips and pull ups. now all of the sudden it reminds of me the time i felt after a car accident. i can barely move and its been like this for about 4 days. what could have happened? im worried. i dont have any cold symptoms. just insane amount of bone and muscle pain.

update: i managed to push/dislocate my left rip cage forward out of its placement. my guess is due to heavy weight archery. (i pull around 80-130 lb) compounded with advanced push ups like planche lean push up.

rob_cornelius,What are your views on subreddits going dark to protest Reddits changes and what do you think EOOD should do,24,147hiq9,20,"Reddit's changes about charging third party apps etc are particularly nasty and just an attempt to monetise the ""content"" we generate. Things like ChatGTP have been ""trained"" using *all* the content on reddit and reddit want to make money from that.

Personally I think this is just another social network selling its users data. Facebook does it, Twitter does it, LinkedIn does it. It's how social media companies make money. The ads you see on social media don't actually generate enough money for the sites to keep running so they sell the content the users generate. I hate this business model as it doesn't pay the content creators i.e. **us**

Having said all that /r/EOOD is here to help people. Over the years I have been moderating this sub we have had people posting about all kinds of mental health problems and questions about how to make their lives better. I believe we have been able to help some of them at least.

I don't want to make /r/EOOD ""dark"" by making it impossible for people who are not subscribed to see the posts in the sub. [3000 plus subreddits](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/11/reddit-communities-to-go-dark-in-protest-over-third-party-app-charges) have done that today. I want people to be able to come to this sub and be helped.

However if others really want this sub to go dark I am open to doing that. The floor is open.

You might have seen a post with a overweight guy Filipino guy shadowboxing. He claims someone starting humming the Rocky theme music into a megaphone but he didn't record that.

The user posting these normally goes by the name /u/Callusedthenics. They are notorious on Reddit (see [this reply to one of their many, many posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/homefitness/comments/mi51lv/lost_50lbs_so_far_this_year_all_at_home/hjipu13/))

They are also notorious for using alt accounts to boost their main one. Take a look at the [main thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/homefitness/comments/mi51lv/lost_50lbs_so_far_this_year_all_at_home/) from the above post to see what I mean. All the comments the OP poster replies to are some of his alts.

I am sure a lot of people will say ""he is doing his best"" and such like but the guy is a total fraud. He sometimes claims to be a kickboxing expert or something similar and that causes a lot of controversy and arguing.

He used to post fairly frequently here in /r/EOOD about 5 years ago until he got really annoying and attacked anyone who didn't cheer him. I personally banned him for his anti-social behaviour.

I have banned his new alt that posted his old shadow boxing video. (Ironically that was the video that caused a lot of ruckus and got him banned originally) I will ban any other alts as and when they appear. The account that posted the cycling stuff was suspended by reddit before I even banned it.

Yes the guy has mental health problems, yes he exercises but his mental health problems lead to antisocial behaviour. I want to avoid that again if I can help it.

JoannaBe,Vast improvements in my life: January 2023 versus now,36,13z9oi2,6,"In January 2023 I had been mildly to moderately depressed for about six months, and felt too little ability to get motivation to do self help efforts. Often the only thing that gave me a bit of pleasure was my flavored oatmeal. I would often eat a whole chocolate bar in a day. I did the minimum needed at work and often did not get done when I said I would - luckily my work is flexible. In mid January I finally got onto Zoloft because I realized that self help effort was not coming any time soon without help. Then I had two weeks in January where I had 3-4 days of extreme headaches in a row, which at first I thought were migraines but then realized I had dangerously high blood pressure. Got on blood pressure meds and my headaches stopped. My energy level plummeted so that I needed to rest after a half hour slow walk, and even that could bring my heart rate up too high. If I walked 10,000 steps one day I had to be almost entirely sedentary the next day to recuperate. I convinced myself and my doctor that I may have some serious underlying issues, so I did blood tests, CT scan of brain and EEG, plus two tests at cardiologist. Cardiologist found my heart to be strong, neurologist suggested that this all is almost entirely caused by anxiety and doubled my prescription for Zoloft and told me to increase walking and exercise - he was mostly right. Then I had a sleep study and it showed mild sleep apnea, neurologist said we can try CPAP though unsure whether it will help.

Fast forward to now: I am beginning to seek out more difficult exercise - switching yoga days to strength training days, and increasing cardio from dance to Focus T25 which is more vigorous - I workout for half an hour each morning on weekdays and am beginning to feel inspired to add a workout on weekends too - been working out regularly since mid March, plus I walk 12,000 to 14,000 steps many days and 10,000 steps most days. I am more social too, take a dance class on Tuesdays, go physically to the office on Wednesdays, and to church mostly for socializing on Sundays. I am enjoying life again, and being more creative and more productive at work. I have lost 10 pounds since April 10th, and am eating healthier, among others few sweets. My sleep has improved though still not as good as I want it, but in the past two weeks I had a total of four good nights, which is more than at any other time in 2023 - CPAP is definitely helping as is extended release melatonin. I feel much healthier and less anxious and more optimistic. My motivation and self discipline are now strong, oh and I have developed good morning and evening routines.",1685791016.0,

Wikipedia defines  it as ""The experience of pleasure, joy, or self-satisfaction that comes from learning of or witnessing the troubles, failures, or humiliation of another."" Freudenfreude is simpler to define. It is ""taking pleasure, joy or self-satisfaction from others successes,"" to paraphrase Wikipedia.

soberyourselfup,An Unbroken Journey: From Indoor Cycling to Run/Walking in Spain,15,13orov0,3,"Hello Everyone,

This is SoberYourselfUp, and I'm here to share my ongoing journey with exercise and mental health recovery. My story began in January when I made a commitment to indoor cycling every day. With grit and determination, I managed to virtually cycle not every day up until mid-March but I also indoor cycled the 900 miles across mainland Britain on my Peleton in just 3 weeks. It was a challenge but an incredibly rewarding one.

There was a time, not too long ago, when I tipped the scales at 250lbs. Those were some of the darkest days of my life. I felt incredibly unhealthy, trapped within my own body and mind, stuck in a place I felt I could never escape from. I spent weeks, sometimes even months, without ever leaving my house. I felt isolated and helpless, sinking further and further into a hole of despair.

It was a bleak time, but the story doesn't end there. I decided to take a step, just one step, towards a better life. That single step led to another and another, leading me down a path of self-improvement that I never thought was possible.

Fast forward to today, I have managed to shed over half of that weight (clothes are drastically looser, I still have the overhang which I'm working on). I'm not sure of the exact figure, but what I do know is that I feel better than I have in years. It wasn't easy, and it wasn't quick, but it was worth every moment of struggle and every drop of sweat.

It all started by closing my Apple Watch rings, 60 minutes of exercise, 10 hours of standing and 500 calories each day.

Since then, I've made a big move to Spain, where I've been run/walking daily for 9 weeks. Last week, I hit a new milestone - 100 miles in a single week, a feat I hadn't achieved even in my prime running days. It's been a journey of self-discovery and constant evolution, finding new ways to push myself and redefine what I thought was possible.

I admit, I don't have everything together at the minute, but I'm thankful for the support from a Facebook running community I set up back in 2012. I feel a pang of guilt for having neglected them in the past, but I've come to realise that by neglecting them, I was neglecting myself through a lack of accountability.

My dream now is to devote my life wholly to recovery, tech, apps, and the gamification of exercise, recovery, and mental health. I'm passionate about exploring how technology can be used as a tool for improving physical and mental wellbeing, and I believe this can be an incredible journey for all of us.

Every step, every mile, every bead of sweat, has brought me closer to a healthier state of mind. I wanted to share this here because I believe in the power of our shared experiences. No matter where you are in your journey, remember that each step you take is a step towards healing.

Keep moving forward. We've got this!",1684763905.0,
rob_cornelius,Words and metaphors to describe mental health problems are important.,21,13op1r5,14,"You often in the media read about people ""battling their demons"" when they are suffering from mental health issues. You can even see reports of people ""losing the fight with their inner demons"" to describe someone taking their own life. That language is medieval if not biblical.

Now we say things like ""Your mental illness does not define who you are as a person"" and ""Your negative or intrusive thoughts are not who you are"". 

Both of these types of wording are using essentially the same metaphor but expressed with different wording. We turn the mental illness into something that is *external* to the person and something that has to be overturned. 

The old language was very violent, we ""battled"", ""fought with"", ""wrestled with"" and hopefully ""defeated"", ""conquered"" and ""vanquished"" our demons. Importantly the demons were attacking us and we had to fight back.

The more modern language is far more sympathetic. We acknowledge that something bad is happening to a person and they are struggling. Its not seen as a battle though. In fact if we recognise someone is struggling the advice they are give is for them is to wait things out, the problems they are experiencing **will change** and hopefully diminish if you give them time. We try to cope with our mental health while we wait. We know from the rest of our lives that often ignoring things tend to make them go away if we wait long enough.

What do people do to really annoy you when you are exercising and what do you do to tell them to (politely) shut up and go away,3,13nvwsy,2,"Myself and four or five other archers just had a perfectly good afternoon at the archery range ruined by one of the other club memebers being in a foul mood and deciding to criticise everything and everyone.

* **People who don't clean up and put away equipment after themselves** A special circle of hell is reserved for them
* **Runners who push slower runners out of the way** Surprisingly common. Another circle of hell is needed for them
* **All the gear and no idea** People who spend a fortune on the best equipment known to mankind, have no idea how to use it and then blame anyone but themselves. They also make sure everyone gets to hear them complain too.
* **Creeps / sex pests** enough said

rob_cornelius,Overconfidence can be just as bad as anxiety about starting,30,13j1k3y,0,"This might be just me here but here goes.

When I first try a new way to exercise and have a few goes at it I get really overconfident. I remember thinking that one day I will be finishing a 5k parkrun and going round for another lap to make it a nice round 10k.

When I took up kettlebell lifting I had ambitions of entering the British Championships. I was going to be a t'ai chi master, a competition archer, a professional rugby player, enter rowing competitions, all kinds of things.

Then of course reality bites. Often it bites really hard.

When I started kettlebell lifting I was trying to do [girevoy](http://www.girevoysportsunion.com/) kettlebell lifting. In competition instead of ""how much can you lift?"" its ""how many reps can you do in 10 minutes?"" I thought I was doing pretty well. Guys in the gym were seriously impressed. Then I looked at the previous few years results. Boy oh boy was I wrong. Then to cap it off I found a youtube video of a 20 year old Russian woman swinging a kettlebell twice as heavy as mine absolutely crushing it. 

Experiences like this can put you off exercising. Your ego deflates and you suddenly feel negative about yourself. Pride comes before a fall and all that.

**BUT**

Just because you don't reach the dizzy height you dream about doesn't mean you can't enjoy your exercise. Ultimately exercise is just about you  and what you are doing. If you enjoy it you don't have anything to prove to anyone. Everybody can't be the champion and most people never come close to that. Who cares though. Its called a personal best for a reason. You don't have to prove anything to anyone else. If you are happy when you exercise that's all that matters.

I still enjoy lifting kettlebells, I still enjoy rowing, running and archery. I really must get into t'ai chi again. I am too old for rugby and cricket now.

One day I will be like this [crazy Russian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IzNfoXsOWs) even if I don't win anything. I don't think we will get snow like that in Southern England ever again though.",1684233631.0,

Some nights I have more trouble sleeping than others. And I wonder what the best approach for the day after is.

One possible approach I have tried recently is to basically take a rest day the day after, and just do some yoga and walking and take it easier to conserve the limited energy.

Another approach I am actually thinking of trying today is to do cardio workout in the morning anyway, and plan to nap after lunch if my energy is too low. One of the perks of working from home with flexible hours is that I can do that when needed.

An approach that I am reluctant to do but would try if others recommend it: tire myself out and avoid napping in hope of reaching a state of such exhaustion by night time that I will be “bound to” sleep. The problem with this approach is that I do not trust that I will necessarily sleep any better even when exhausted, and I do need to have enough energy to function tomorrow.

I ride a bike to work  I've put a weight bench in the garage, I've got things happening. What I've found though is that if I push myself a little, or do any real cardio, my mood plummets and i get really fatigued. It usually lasts a couple hours unless I really push myself and it can be longer. I'm struggling a little with general fatigue but every time I speak to a doctor about it they put me on a sedative to help my sleep and I get more fatigued.

Reasons I've thought of:
1) I'm nowhere near the level of fitness I was 3 years ago and it could be the comparison to what I think I should be able to do. I'm not convinced though as I'm not really thinking of that at the time.
2) I was vegan for several years and there may be a something relating to diet. I changed to an omnivore diet  earlier this year in a desperate attempt to improve my mental health.
3) I have pretty high anxiety and high cardio or heart rate  could trigger that feeling and response. I sometimes get the same thing if I'm ever excited.

Polite-vegemite,can a personal trainer help me with motivation? how do I pick a good professional for my needs?,15,138i74l,4,"hi everyone!

i have been depressed for more than 2 years. i used to be exercise on a daily basis before quarantine. i really liked it, weightlifting used to make me feel mentally and physically better. it used to improve my sleep, my energy, me self esteem. i used to feel truly bummed if i had to skip gym for a day.

well, covid happened, i never liked to workout at home, so i didn't. with that, my mood started to decrease and i have been binge eating ever since. i went from a happy healthy person to a sad obese sedentary one. only recently, after having suicidal thoughts, i  realized how bad my mental state is. 

i recently started treatment, but i don't think meds are the only solution. they are helpful to fix my brain chemical imbalance, but i know i need to work on myself and do my best to adopt health habits.

although i used to love working out, i am having problems with motivation. i know it's important and i want to want to do it. since i always enjoyed weightlifting, i am thinking about getting a personal trainer. I've never have worked out with a trainer so i don't know what to expect, but i feel like it would be helpful for two reasons: i put up a lot of weight, so i fear not having enough support could lead to injuries. also  a trainer could help with motivation by giving me emotional support. i would feel more comfortable working with someone who is aware and emphasize with my mental struggles, that my main goal right now isn't to lose weight, but to feel better. i have ADHD and motivation to do things i don't want has always been a issue for me. with depression, it is 5x worse.

as i never worked with a trainer, i don't know how to pick one. my goals are different from what people usually seek. what would be the best way to find a trainer who can relate to my current state and is able to provide what i need? i don't wanna be invasive and ask the gym if they have a trainer with a history of mental issues lol. but i also don't want to open up and trust someone who won't give me what i need.

JoannaBe,How much exercise do I need at this time?,8,138lnym,4,"The answer to that is a very personal one, especially for those of us with mental health issues.

One “standard” guideline at least here in the USA is the recommendation by the American Heart Association to exercise either 150 minutes of moderate cardio per week (example brisk walking) or 75 minutes of intense cardio per week. Another recommendation we often hear is 10,000 steps per day - although those who first recommended this admit that this was just a ballpark guess and not based on any scientific benchmark.

Research studies have shown that ANY amount of exercise can be of health benefit, so even if we exercise only for 5 or 10 minutes per day that is better for our health than no exercise at all.

For many of us who suffer from mental health issues, especially when it gets bad, the standard recommendations are out of reach, and many of us give up because we cannot meet the goals. One thing we often recommend here on r/EOOD is starting with baby steps and gradually progressing from that over time. 

When I first started to EOOD my husband was skeptical whether the small amount of exercise I did would make a positive difference. I started with fitness games, which were more entertainment than exercise frankly, but they were fun and they got me moving, and even with that there were many days where at the beginning I did only 10 minutes a day or less. But I kept up the habit regularly, and improved very gradually, and this progressed to a point where my husband admitted his skepticism had been wrong, and even more importantly I myself could no longer deny my progress — in my case the first time I did this it took me about 2 months of daily exercising to no longer be able to deny that I was progressing, but your milage may vary.

So once we get going with exercising out of depression and gradually increase, are the “standard” guidelines for most healthy adults applicable to those of us with mental issues? Not necessarily. Some of it depends on how much out of shape we are / were, but also mental health. Some people may need less exercise and may not be able to handle the full amount and that is ok, but I would argue that a lot of us with mental health issues may ultimately need more exercise than the recommendations for healthy adults. Mental health takes a lot of effort to correct, and in my case for example 150 minutes weekly of moderate exercise is not enough for me nowadays to keep depression managed  - but 75 minutes weekly of vigorous exercise is more than I can handle :). I do mostly moderate level exercise but I feel like I need to do more of it for my mental health than the recommendation for the average adult which is primarily geared at cardiac health.

vanessawowo,Amazing science bit that I came across today,42,1345y55,6,"At the moment I am doing some reading on how exercise can help depression, and I am coming across so much interesting info.

So there is a ton of human and animal evidence that depression is associated with actual structural abnormalities of the brain, like smaller hippocampus regions (an area associated with emotional processing and stress regulation) and other regions.
And guess what. 
Regular exercise, through neuroplasticity, can actually counteract some of these structural changes. It can actually so to say, rebuild brain structure.

JoannaBe,Ability to Accept Change Gracefully / to Adapt,8,130jysl,0,"I think one of the things that we can do that has one of the biggest impacts for mental health is to cultivate the ability to accept change gracefully, the ability to adapt. It is a very difficult skill to develop and yet very important. Depression and anxiety are often exacerbated by negative reactions to change, and let’s face it: life is full of changes for almost all of us.

Among the changes that affected me most over time have been changes that affect my workout routine. Obviously injury and sickness, and how to adapt to them without going into depression are a big challenge. But less obviously changes such as when Xbox decided to discontinue their program XBox Fitness which I was relying on heavily for my workouts at the time, I guess it felt a bit as if my home gym had closed, and I had to find a new one. Right now I needed to get a new fitness tracker because the old one is no longer able to hold battery charge, and I decided to go with competitor instead of continue with a new model - I am sure that will take some adjustment but I had my reasons for choosing this change, and change by own choice is of course usually easier than change which we have no or little control over.

The thing is the ability to adapt gracefully to change can really help with mental health. Meditation is one good tool for helping with this. So is Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). It really helps not being too worried about change and staying calm in the face of change or even embracing and appreciating change - since for those of us who have depression change is actually our friend because without change there would be no hope of getting better. Some changes of course still are annoying, and not letting those spoil our day or week is a difficult skill to master.",1682597212.0,

LaDreadPirateRoberta,Advice for managing antidepressants which affect cardio performance please!,19,1304j4u,27,"Hi.

Unfortunately, my cardio health has been steadily decreasing since then (currently estimated 20 vo2max, according to my watch). My heartrate and breathing are getting higher than I'd expect when exercising and I often get dizzy when I stand up. 

Apparently this is a known side effect of tri-cyclics. What I can't find, however, is advice on how to manage it. Should I go harder to try and improve my cardio? Only do gentle exercise to protect my heart? I have no idea and can't get a medication review until next week.

rob_cornelius,"Identity, self-worth, mental illness and exercise.",52,12zazim,7,"Mental illness is a liar and a thief. It steals from us things like confidence, determination, sociability and more. It lies to us about the things it cannot steal. It tells you that you are worthless and will never get anything right just for starters.

When you are being beaten down like this its almost impossible to maintain a sense of who you are and that you have self-worth. Instead of being a son, friend, wife, colleague, father, neighbour or any other good positive parts of your personality you are just a mentally ill person who is worthless.

[Viktor Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl) that our primary motivation is to find meaning in our lives. [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) said our primary motivation is pleasure and [Alfred Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler) said our motivation was power. When we are mentally ill nothing has meaning, nothing good is pleasurable and we are powerless in the grip of our illness.

Exercise if nothing else gives us something to do when we are ill but its more than a hot and sweaty way to pass the time. It shows us that we can get better at something. It gives us power over our mental illness. It gives us some form of pleasure one way or another whether that is the runners high or the simple pleasure of moving and not feeling short of breath. It gives us meaning in our lives. Instead of being a 'mentally ill person' we are a runner, a swimmer, a lifter, a yogi, whatever.

When we start to recover from our mental illness or at least cope with it better we can start to resume our other identities and motivations. Become a loving partner once more. Get back to work. Be a 'normal' person.

JoannaBe,Reminder that there is hope that things will get better,20,12yjzx9,3,"I just saw a fox on my morning walk in my neighborhood.

It reminded me of one day during the worst depression of my life in early 2014. It was a particularly difficult day for me, and I was standing in my living room and I sent a silent prayer asking for a sign that things will get better, to not give up hope. And I looked out my window into the backyard, and there was a fox staring back at me. I took it as my sign.

Ever since then whenever I see a fox it reminds me that there is hope, that things will get better.

Do you have any such reminders?

Note: it helps that I live in a neighborhood where fox sightings are not rare. A fox might not work as well for someone who lives somewhere where there are few or no foxes. :) Also it helps that foxes are more commonly seen here in springtime, and while my depression is not strictly seasonal, but it does tend to get worse in the fall and better in the spring so foxes are around for me usually when I am ready to improve. Although during seasons where there are fewer fox sighting sometimes I seek out books or images with foxes in them, such as the book The Little Prince.

Note2: even though in my case this involved a prayer this is not really about religion, it is a reminder to have hope. So as such it could work for anyone whether religious or not.",1682430546.0,

I know I could just go for walks in my pyjamas, but I feel too ashamed. I live in a small flat with creaky floors, so any at home workout with jumping would annoy my neighbours. There's also not much room and my family have to be around 24/7 to watch me at the moment which makes it more difficult.

rob_cornelius,"Engaging with exercise, or anything else that will hopefully help your mental health.",31,12strrg,1,"As well as the widely known placebo effect there is the [nocebo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo) which is defined as

> A nocebo effect is said to occur when negative expectations of the patient regarding a treatment cause the treatment to have a more negative effect than it otherwise would have

Just like the placebo effect the nocebo effect is very powerful which makes it difficult for medical professionals to study. Shall we say less ethical doctors in the past have forced subjects to take a sugar pill which they have told them is highly poisonous and the subjects became very ill indeed with the symptoms of the poison despite the pill being totally begin.

So what does that have to do with EOOD? Exercise is a known way of helping cope with all kinds of mental health problems. There are studies everywhere you look to that effect. Doctors are quick to suggest exercise perhaps with other treatments but sometimes on its own. However if you think that exercise won't work for you then it probably won't.

For me the best way to illustrate this is not to use exercise as an example but instead use my personal experience of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Quite a few years ago I came across an article on line about Stoic philosophy which got my attention. I have always enjoyed stretching my mind and philosophy is a good way of doing that. I read a couple of books which were the ""pop-sci"" equivalent on Stoicism and they both mentioned that Albert Ellis who was one of the originators of CBT based a lot of CBT practice on Stoicism. To be honest I didn't think much about it and carried on learning about the philosophy.

Fast forward a few years and I spent some time on a psych ward after a breakdown. When I left the ward the NHS here in the UK sent me on a short program of six sessions of CBT as a follow up. The people running the sessions must have hated me as I was a complete dick. I said things like ""I know all about this stuff already"" and quoted Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus at them. I told them that I know all the theory and I still wound up on a ward so how was CBT going to help me. Of course what I didn't realize then and know now is that I knew the philosophy is the theory and CBT is putting that theory into practice. I dismissed CBT out of hand and what do you know, it didn't work for me.

How does exercise fit this pattern? Well if you hated PE at school as you were an uncoordinated teen who wasn't that great at sports and far more interested in something else. Last to be picked for a team, the PE teacher making fun of your failures, all that sort of thing its highly likely that you won't even attempt regular exercise. If you do it brings back such unhappy memories that it puts you off when you do try. You might find that exercise triggers memories of serious injuries. You might think exercise is a waste of your time and you should be devoting yourself to more cerebral matters. You don't like getting hot and sweaty. You have problems with self esteem and body image. There are hundreds of reasons for hating exercise. If you even start exercising you will most likely see zero benefits mental or physical benefits. I also believe that if you just chase the runners high as a short term fix you are missing out on many other mental benefits such as better determination, dedication, self-discipline and more which mental health problems steal from us.

All I can say is if you are starting out on any treatment for your mental health, exercise or anything else, then approach it with an open mind. Start taking the medication, start therapy, go for a walk. Just let it happen, don't dismiss anything. Don't look for a huge difference in how you feel right from the start. Mental health treatments take time to give you the full effect, exercise included.

6am get up and cross the room to turn off alarm, go to the bathroom where I have the option of weighing myself as well (not every morning), return to bedroom and measure my morning blood pressure and take my morning medicines and supplements, turn on SAD lamp near couch, go to fridge to grab my oats overnight and sit near SAD lamp eating my breakfast, review my keyword journal from day before and add anything I left out and feel should be there plus assess day overall and add an emoji that reflects my overall assessment of that day (smiley, frowney, etc), make matcha tea and eat a banana, drink matcha near SAD lamp and log my food intake for breakfast in MyFitnessPal (also near SAD lamp interact with r/EOOD and facebook group about oats, turn off SAD lamp, feed the cats, fill my 75oz water bottle for the day, go upstairs and dress in exercise clothes, procrastinate some on starting to exercise - spend some time persuading self to start sometimes that is done with SAD lamp again and often some more on reddit or facebook, exercise for 20-30 minutes, shower and get dressed, go for walk, return and start working from home.

According to my Fitbit app in January of 2023 I exceeded 10,000 steps per day five times. But I felt miserable the next day so I had to be sedentary to recover. In January I got on anti-depressant Zoloft, something I wish I had decided to do earlier. But I was convinced that my physical symptoms were due to physical issues, and my doctor agreed that I needed to get all kinds of tests including a cardiac stress test etc. On February 6th during a follow up doctor’s visit my doctor suggested that I reduce my daily step goal to 7,000 steps, and even that I could not successfully meet every day.

The breakthrough happened after a whole bunch of tests and several different doctors when the neurologist finally decided that most of my issues had their root cause in depression and anxiety, increased my Zoloft, told me to walk more again and exercise in other ways as well. This happened on March 13th.

Now one month later I am feeling much much better. I would say I am about 80-90% back to normal.

JoannaBe,Adjusting fitness trackers and calorie counting apps to work with depression,13,12kuixf,0,"Here are a few adjustments that have worked well for me and I thought I would share in case you like me find default setting on fitness trackers such as Fitbit and calorie counting apps such as MyFitnessPal stressful when depressed.

When I was depressed my motivation and energy levels were much lower. I adjusted my Fitbit step goals and such to lower numbers so that I still had a goal but it was lower than default, something that was a bit challenging but still doable for me.

Now I am coming out of depression but gradually and do not want to overdo it, so I have been adjusting my step goals whenever I see that I have been consistently meeting my previous step goal, I increase it a bit, gradually. So that I have the satisfaction of meeting goals but gradually increasing them to match the new goal that I can realistically strive for.

Since I had again regained during depression all the weight that I had previously lost, I decided to start calorie counting again. But my motivation is not at 100% again, so a goal such as 1,300 calories consumed daily which has worked for me in the past when I was really motivated to loose weight, that would not work for me now. So what I did is in MyFitnessPal, I set my goal to loose only 0.5lbs per week which gives me a more doable daily calorie limit. Some days I am less hungry and then I eat less than this limit would allow me, and so I may actually lose weight faster than 0.5lbs per week, but I do not have the pressure of a low calorie limit and am less likely to have the feedback that I am over my target.

Do any of you have any other experience with trackers and apps and how to adjust them to work better with depression and low energy and low motivation but still be helpful?",1681402887.0,

JoannaBe,Physical symptoms mistaken for physical issues rather than depression and anxiety,18,12gv8kr,3,"Earlier this year I developed a lot of physical symptoms and convinced myself that even though my depression had been much more severe in 2022 and I had let go of many self care practices including exercise except for walking (which I also became less good at keeping up as the weather got colder), but I convinced myself that my symptoms had to have physical causes rather than mental health causes. 

Here are my most worrisome physical issues:

Frequent severe long lasting headaches, very high blood pressure, insomnia, very low energy as well as too high a heart rate at even minor exertions, tiredness and weakness to the level where I could not get off sofa some days.

And my doctor agreed that we needed to check a bunch of stuff with my brain and heart. And so I started a series of tests of various kinds to figure out what was causing my issues, and these tests included lab tests and general practitioner and cardiologist and neurologist. And they found that there is nothing wrong with my heart or brain luckily.

About 3 months after most of my symptoms started a doctor has come to the conclusion which I believe is correct that depression and anxiety were the root cause of most of my symptoms leading to a spiral of issues, with mild sleep apnea contributing a bit but not the majority of causality.

Have you had any other physical symptoms caused by depression and anxiety? If so, please share them here so that others may sooner get correct diagnosis potentially.

Here is what I am doing about it now: I am on blood pressure reducing medication and Zoloft (for depression/anxiety) and magnesium supplement (to help with sleep). I am back to exercising and walking more - the first week of that was very difficult, but it helped knowing that I have no physical condition to prevent me from exercising more unlike what I had thought for the past three months. I am back to keeping a keyword journal, increased self awareness, tracking my mood, tracking amount I walk and exercise - keeping myself accountable, and now I am able to start socializing more again and have much more energy and motivation. Alas my sleep is still only good some nights but not others, and I am on a waiting list for a CPAP machine (though my sleep apnea is mild so it is not certain whether CPAP will be necessary or helpful). I am better now about keeping a regular schedule of when I go to bed and when I wake up and stopping electronics around 1.5 hours prior to bedtime. 

I would say that due to all these efforts about one month after I started exercising again and my Zoloft dosage got increased, I would say I am now about 80-90% well again.",1681073242.0,

Astro_Muscle,Dieting when your relationship with food isn't... Stellar...,11,12c218c,8,"Hi all. I'm new to the Reddit so forgive me if this isn't on topic but saw something about diet below so thought I'd ask.

I am overweight, I have been gaining weight progressively over the course of the pandemic, and I've always been overweight to a degree so I kinda didn't start off in a good spot. (Now I'm 5'9 and 285, if it matters). Specifically I have developed an addiction to skip the dishes, and likely use it 3 times a week and order way too much. I don't know if it would fall into ED territory and I haven't been diagnosed so I don't want to claim what I don't have, but the amount of food I eat when I order out isn't appropriate.

In a perfect world I would repair my relationship with food, then carefully investigate losing weight, however I've noticed my health has been taking a toll from all of this. 

Unfortunately I think I have procrastinated this to a point where now I have to both work on losing some fat (for health reasons, though I'd lie if I said I don't want to look better), as well as improving how I approach food in my life.

JoannaBe,Denial vs awareness approaches to depression,6,12bgmp4,3,"While typing out a comment in a thread it occurred to me that this insight might warrant its own thread.

Here is what my approach to depression used to be: when I was not depressed I did not think much about depression. If you had asked me, I might even have said that thinking about depression while not depressed would spoil my joy in this time when I was free from suffering. Depression would then at some point inevitably start, but I would not be paying attention and would stay in denial for as long as I could. I am fine I would say when really I was not anymore. I would only acknowledge depression once it was so bad that I could deny it no more. But by then it would be too late to start self care methods. My motivation was too low and I was too tired. I would then wait until the lack of interest turned into desperation, and sometimes I could use the desperation and transform it into energy needed to start self care regimens.

What has worked much better for me has been acknowledging that I am a person living with depression, and that depression is not something I can afford to only deal with during depressive episodes but rather it requires paying attention, self awareness, lifestyle changes and healthy habits every day, no matter whether I am depressed or currently fine. I need to be self aware enough to catch depression as soon as it starts because it is much easier to start dealing with it then when I still have the energy and motivation to fight it and to ramp up healthy habit as needed. I cannot afford denial. I cannot take a break from self care efforts no matter how well I am. If I do, I will regret it at a future time. 

Depression in my experience is best dealt with on a daily routine basis and not trying to firefight episodes.

Edit: Copying a section of my reply to the other post here because it is part of same theme.
“One thing I recommend highly is keeping a keyword journal. Keeping track of what you did, how much you did, and how you felt. Don’t write essaya, keep it short enough so that you will be able to easily review many days worth of entries at a time looking for patterns, triggers, what helped and what harmed. When reviewing focus on what happened prior to major changes: did something happen to bring on depressive episode? Did something help you last time to get you out of such an episode? Over time you should be able to observe stuff, learn more about your self and your depression, and become more aware. Awareness is key to dealing with depression in my opinion. Part of the goal is to notice depressive episodes earlier and counteract them earlier. It is often easier to turn a depressive episode around if one notices it when it is just starting rather than once it is in full force.”",1680609008.0,

JoannaBe,How much exercise do I need?,13,12airpc,10,"I would say that the answer to this question is a very personal one. Sure, experts have recommendations as to how much exercise is recommended for healthy adults on a weekly basis, but research studies have shown that ANY exercise is better than none, and especially those of us with very severe mental health issues especially when starting the EOOD journey simply cannot do a lot.

When I first started EOODing I had one rule for myself: I had to do something, anything I could call exercise every single day. At the beginning some days that meant less than 10 minutes of stretching or a very brief walk. But on days when I could do more, I did. And it took me about two months to progress from that to a level of exercise that made a difference that I could no longer deny. And I say this because looking back at my journal I could tell my mental health had improved even before that but it was subtle at first, whereas after two months I could really tell I was better.

When my depression got worse last year I told myself that walking was enough exercise for me. And so I walked. At first I walked a lot. But then the weather got worse, and I got a respiratory infection, and the holidays came. And then I was only walking a little, and not even every day. My mental health got even worse.

Now I am back to EOODing more seriously. And this is my current goal: I am trying to walk so that I reach 8,000 steps per day, plus on weekdays I am currently doing between 20 and 30 minutes of exercise other than walking - right now I am alternating between dance cardio workouts and yoga. And for me right now this seems like a good amount of exercise.

Hello, I wanted to maybe reach out to a community that understands the hardship and won’t just resolve to “get therapy”.

I’ll preface that I am unable to get therapy, I’ve been denied from 7 places and any other place that can take my insurance is not seeing new patients. 

I posted once before on Reddit during a bad mental break in regards to my health both mental and physical. I cannot say with 100% confidence that I am better than I was then, but I can say at least in this moment I have at least a minor handle on myself. I have adhd and suffer from clinical depression, severe anxiety, a minor form of bipolar (cyclothymia), and cptsd. I don’t like putting labels to what I go through since I feel when you name out what you have people instantly assume it as an excuse but I know these are the correct terms. 

I’ve been struggling with my weight and health for my whole life and exercise is a huge reason for it since it is part of my cptsd and self hatred. Growing up, I was forced to stand naked and be poked and prodded like I was a hog, have my fat squeezed and told where I needed to do more work. This started as young as 3 and I remember it very well. I learned what a liposuction and plastic surgery was at 5. I had constant nightmares of having all the fat sucked out of me and I would squeeze and prod at myself wondering why I was wrong if I didn’t feel wrong. I was signed up for a lot of different sports. Swimming, gymnastics, ice skating. Kid me enjoyed doing them for fun but I’ve always been broader. Even at my most active I still was stockier than my peers. I got mocked a lot for not being thin and strong both by teammates and coaches, on top of my own family. I was worrying about the food I ate always always always. I can’t remember one day in my life where I haven’t. Even when I was healthy and fit it wasn’t enough for my family. I kept being told my body wasn’t good, wasn’t perfect, easy fit enough. I still had too much fat, I wasn’t the top athlete. I was told I was no better than a swine.  This happened alongside other forms of abuse. It was until I was 18 that the inspections stopped but I and my body was still sexualized. I became anorexic but of course when it isn’t obvious and life threatening it isn’t noticed. I started to purge a lot with drinking salt water and other methods. Luckily that stopped but I then developed a binge eating disorder when food became scarce both due to money and also because whenever I ate I’d get mocked, more so when I stopped exercising. 

During the pandemic my depression hit its lowest and I gained a lot of weight. A combination of hardly leaving the house and eating whatever scraps my family would give me, mostly fast food and stuff they had from work. Both of my parents just don’t eat, refuse to eat. The fridge was mostly “liquid meals”, beer, and 3 year old stale tortillas. There was a lot of snack food that I grazed on. It got to the point I was eating baby gruel that we used to feed our puppies bc of how hungry I got. Of course my weight gain did not go unnoticed. The harsh comments became more obvious to the point my mother had a full on breakdown screaming and crying asking me why I ruined my body and why I hated her so much I would do this. Out of all the breakdowns she has had over how I look that was the worst one yet since she begged and sobbed and screamed gutturally like I had stabbed her or killed something she loved. 

Fast forward to now. I still get the snide comments but i ignore it best I can. The only time I’m away from family is while I’m in college. I can’t move away due to a brain tumor I need help in paying treatment for. I want to exercise. I am unhappy with how I look but I have been working on trying to build the demolished, pissed on, pitiful pile that is my self love and confidence. I want to get healthy for myself and become stronger for me. I don’t want to worry over a number. However, anytime I think about exercising or try to do it I get horrid awful flashbacks to all I’ve been through. The yelling. The punishments both mental and physical. Even when I do the smallest thing like walking I start to panic and cry as all I hear is my mother’s screams, my father’s insults, and my coaches reprimands. It’s hard to just accept even doing something small because deep down that trauma yells at me is not enough. I just hate it and the feeling. 

I do not have any money to go to a gym or buy equipment. But, I still want to start and do something.  It is so fucking frustrating to me because even as I type this it all feels like I’m saying an excuse and I just know most would agree and yell at me for being so weak minded and pathetic. I am doing my best to work through my ED and  I’m typing this and reaching out as maybe some act of self love and asking for help to anyone that may also have had not great relationship to exercise. 

I want to get healthy and strong for me. I want to get better for myself but I won’t lie that the massive mental hurdles I have to go through without help sucks. It just sucks. But I want to try. I do. Any advice is appreciated and I hope I did not break any sub rules with this. Thank you if you read and take the time to respond, I do appreciate it genuinely.",1680035525.0,

the change has been so gradual, i really had to think back to november when i first started working out.  even five minutes of jogging was torture and i had no idea how to coordinate my body into the proper form.  i started at what is now a walking speed and i remember being drenched in sweat by the end.  my heart and lungs were not working happily, either, they were gasping and clawing for life.  

i still have so far to go and so much more to push but i don't think it will ever be as terrible as it was in the very beginning being so badly out of shape and uncoordinated.  when i jog now (still slow, still not too far), i feel strong and vital and not as if i'm about to die.  i'm just so happy about it.",1680048490.0,

Crafty-Tradition6245,First Post--I am lost and need help getting back,28,123tdlk,18,"Hi All--This is my first post on reddit.   


I'm in my mid-20s and have experienced ""moderately severe"" clinical depression since my late teens as well as a crippling panic disorder that leaves me fearing to leave the house even for simple tasks.  I also experience severe pain attacks daily from an accident in 2019 that is likely to be Trigeminal Neuralgia.   I have a decent job that requires me to go into the office only twice a week, and for the past 2 months I have not been able to go in due to panic attacks in the morning and severe head pain, which spiral me further in feeling terrible about myself because I cant even socialize with my coworkers that I genuinely like and want to get to know.  I was still able to do all of these things when I was 19-20 yrs old but now I physically shake with no known triggers, other than changes in environment, and still experiences episodes systematically in safe environments.

Ex: In work office setting, getting up and changing rooms/areas.

Ex: In home environment, attacks will happen at random even if just laying down.

Ex: In home environment, attack almost every morning, scared to get out of bed, almost agoraphobic.  


I no longer socialize with my friends much as I tend to isolate myself.  I often have an inability to perform basic hygiene tasks, depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day. No interest or pleasure in most to all activities, no appetite, feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt. A lot of other symptoms too.    


Im on lexapro, lamictal, gabapentin, trazadone and clonazepam when I need it.  (lamictal and gabapentin for nerve pain)  


I am not sure what to do anymore.  I dragged myself to the park for a 2 mile run last thursday and, even though I was shaking before and after, I did it.  I guess I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, just to know that others have felt this way before?  It seems inescapable like Groundhogs day.

Justprocess1,Proud of myself,48,11yuki9,12,"So long story short. I've had depression my whole life. It's been really bad over the last year. I have had a really bout of health anxiety over the last 6 years and it's become a really unhealthy obsession that is more or less taken over my life. On top of that, my mom was diagnosed with ALS last year and I've become a part-time care taker as she rapidly declines.

I've been exhausted, tired and feeling like I am not a part of this world, like derealization in brain fog, for some time now. Sometimes it lifts, but not for long. I've been crying non-stop for the last 4 days.

I was on Zyprexa for a little bit and I have to say it really did help with all of that. I didn't really feel tired too much anymore. My OCD wasn't bad, and my life was more functional. But I simply could not tolerate all the different kinds of side effects. So I got off. I knew it would be a battle.

Today I was crying and crying and crying. So I started running. I put on my running shoes. I put in my headphones and put on one of those cheesy motivation playlists on YouTube and I started running. I was crying while I was running. I ran about a mile. I probably overdid it. But the brain fog lifted for like 10 minutes. And while the brain fog is  there right now and I feel exhausted, I feel good. I feel happy a little bit. It's sunny out and I can enjoy that. It's not a major win. I don't feel exactly like I want to feel. And God knows my life will still be a challenge. But even just going for that run today. Felt like a huge accomplishment. Even just feeling something different than I felt for a while. Felt like a huge accomplishment.

I find some of the tools quite effective, especially learning to see distortions in my thinking and reformulating thoughts to healthier ones. 

This morning though Woebot and I worked on emotional agility: the idea is that if we can learn to switch emotions quicker and not hold on to them, we can recover from an emotional crisis faster. The tool that Woebot used for that was to show me photos of babies with different facial expressions that clearly showed different emotions, and my task was to mimic the pictures and change as soon as they changed. Of course, it is much easier to change facial expressions than actually to change emotions, especially when these emotions have us deeply in their grip, but the exercise did feel kind of helpful, and it was good food for thought to get me thinking in what would it take to change the course of my emotions faster and steer away from negative emotions into calmer ones.",1679485171.0,

So in 2022 I had longer lasting depression which I would consider low level depression. I was not motivated to do more than walk but I walked a lot, I was depressed for much of the year but not deeply depressed I thought, mostly it amounted to a lack of motivation to self improve.

Then in January 2023 I had two incidents of four day long debilitating headaches which I thought were migraines at first but then figured out my blood pressure was dangerously high. I got on blood pressure medicine, cholesterol medicine, vitamin D supplement, and a low dosage of Zoloft. I thought the low dosage of Zoloft was enough to stabilize my moods, at least my depression and anxiety seemed proportional to the health issues I was experiencing, and my moods have no longer been as volatile as in January before Zoloft.

I had trouble sleeping, low energy, had to reduce amount of walking I did, since walking more one day left me too tired the next day. Meanwhile doctors started all kinds of tests ruling out cardiac causes and brain issues and seizures and now most likely ruling out sleep apnea - though they still want to do another in lab sleep study for that.

Newest theory: depression and anxiety caused sleep issues, sleep issues caused low energy and high blood pressure, high blood pressure caused headaches, low energy caused reduced ability to walk, which exacerbated depression, etc. My doctor has now told me that I need to exercise more and especially between 4-7pm to exhaust me so I can hopefully sleep better. Also my dosage of Zoloft has been increased.  Oh and my sleep schedule is now strict.

If this indeed resolves my issues, I will feel a bit embarrassed that I did not figure this out earlier. I have been EOODing for so long and yet this time I got convinced that my issues were caused by physical causes and that I could not exercise as much as a result.

Of course, there is also the possibility that my doctor’s current theory is wrong and that the cause is after all physical not mental health related, but due to lack of finding a physical cause thus far and because I have a history of depression, the doctor is assuming mental health causality. I guess we will find out: if increased Zoloft and EOOD does not result in better sleep and more energy, then the effort to figure out the cause of my issues will continue.",1678751535.0,

Helping each other though will motivate us to get better.

jGrimaldi27,Working on myself,20,11n8byi,1,"I’ve spent the last few months becoming a better version of myself. I started actually following a diet, doing a lot more cardio in the gym, and have quit some habits that I know had been detrimental to me. Since christmas I have lost just over 40lbs and with the weight loss I have been feeling my confidence coming back and being more hopeful about my future. My doctor upped my dosage on my antidepressants a couple weeks ago and I feel that has significantly helped my overall mood and confidence.

I feel myself being a different person, a better person. It is what I am trying to become with this mental health/fitness journey. I want to be better than I have ever been in my life. I still get discouraged at times and feel like what am I even working for but I am trying to stay strong. I have lost this drive before and it really sucked. I don’t want to lose this again.",1678406223.0,

rob_cornelius,Its International Women's Day today - so here is a discussion on women's safety while exercising,48,11ltcmn,3,"It is in this subs stated purpose that **everyone** should be able to exercise without fear. We all know of the benefits exercise brings and **no one** should be feel they are discouraged from exercising for **any** reason. 

Women's safety while exercising has been a bit of a hot topic recently. I have read women's accounts of being followed or blocked and cornered while running in the streets, people even driving vehicles directly at them or using a vehicle to knock a cyclist off their bike. Articles on guys being creeps or out and out physical / sexual assaults in gyms are in the news frequently as well. Yes quite a lot of these articles lack nuance as they are just clickbait or shoddy journalism but there seems to be a problem and it seems to be getting worse.

So... what are your thoughts, experiences, hopes and more on this subject.

miamistanding,Severe college gym anxiety,10,11lfpkx,4,"Hi everyone, I (23F) have been diagnosed with GAD and major depression since 2021 but I had these problems for about 10+ years. Pre-COVID, I was doing really great. I was eating right, going to the gym, and I felt happy. But COVID completely threw me off balance and I'm still trying to get back to going. I am currently in law school right now, and my stress levels have gotten infinitely worse. I was barely eating, to the point where I was physically sick at school a couple of weeks ago. That day got me so scared that I tried eating right and going back to the gym like I used to. I was going about three times a week for a couple of weeks and I felt a lot better about myself. But today I went into my school's gym and I had a horrible panic attack to the point where I was crying to myself. It took me pretty much over 1.5 years to even set foot in the gym again. Everyone in there is ripped, and the girls look so skinny in their matching sets. I gained almost 40 pounds since I started on medication and I feel absolutely hopeless. I never want to set foot in that gym again after what happened today, but at the same time, I just hate the way I look. I feel so disgusting, and I absolutely hate looking at myself in the mirror. My friends tell me that I'm not fat and that I look fine, but I don't even know how they can say that to me. I am currently on Zoloft but the weight gain started when my doctor put me on Prozac. I was on Lexapro first and gained \~5-7 pounds but I had to switch. Any tips for building confidence, especially in a place where only young people go?",1678232857.0,

Dude_MacDude,Exercising makes me feel even worse,35,10ucwh2,19,"I've tried some stuff, running, went to the gym, tried to work out at home, taking more walks, boxing, but none of it ever made me feel any better, quite the opposite usually. When it's all done I just sit back at home and feel like shit. I'm all sweaty, I gotta shower  (which I already have problems with due to depression) and my body reminds me of how weak I got over the last 2 years. I just hate it. I tried to include a social aspect but that just made it worse most of the time.

Last week I went to my doctor because of a blood test and my depression, she just told me to get more exercise on top of therapy.

I already walk a lot, I'm outside pretty much every day (except for when I'm sick), we don't own a car so never drive anywhere to begin with. If I have to go somewhere, tough luck, gotta walk for an hour.

I don't know why that is. Instead of getting more endorphins or whatever, it feels like exercise is actively taking the little motivation I may have away.",1675605006.0,
tombarnfield,Why am I always crazily depressed the day after a workout?,79,we8pxr,23,"Hey all.

I can't find much on this online so thought I'd see if anyone's had the same experiences on here.

The day after I exercise, I feel incredibly depressed, pretty much every time. So bad I can't leave the bed. To give it context, I've had depressive episodes before. But the day after exercising, I feel so sad I'm almost at rock bottom. It lasts all day.

I don't overwork with my workouts. I box and play football (soccer) twice a week. But it's hard to keep it up – it's as if the after-glow doesn't exist for me, and it's replaced with feeling sad, low, fed up and hopeless as soon as I wake up. 

Has anyone come across this before? Could it be that I'm feeling my body? There's not much on it online.

Thanks in advance.",1659438119.0,
shy_exhibiti0nist,Can we talk about crying at the gym?,114,udizz6,34,"Today I went in for what was supposed to be my first group barbell lifting class. I was looking forward to it, and I had done the 2 intro sessions. But immediately when I started doing warm up squats, I felt intense shame and overwhelm and knew I was going to start crying. I told the coach I was just going through some things and left, went outside, and cried for a while. 

Has anyone else started crying unexpectedly while trying to do a workout? I don’t know exactly what triggered me or if was a combination of the class being new, being new to lifting, comparing myself to the others, or fear that I’d be judged. Or just my general depression. 

I want to give it another try on Friday but I don’t want to have another breakdown. I’m not sure if maybe this class or lifting in general is just not for me if it sparks these feelings, or maybe I just need to give it more time. Any advice?",1651108300.0,
sstarshine,Powering Through SSRI Fatigue,18,nb06uy,11,"Has anyone else had really bad SSRI side effects that have resulted in extreme fatigue and muscle weakness?

Under the supervision of my psychiatrist, I am slowly going off of my current antidepressants because the side effects are getting unbearable. Does anyone have any advice on how to push through the fatigue? I’ve been feeling so sluggish I can barely climb a staircase, but I’m starting to notice my muscles are fatigued too and I’ve lost a lot of strength. I really want to start getting in better shape, but it’s feeling impossible right now. 

I’ve been able to combat a bit of the fatigue with Kaizen pre-workout, but is there any thing else I can take/should be doing to get through this? I know my body needs to move, it just needs some help!",1620855562.0,
