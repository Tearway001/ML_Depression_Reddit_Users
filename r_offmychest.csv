AutoModerator,We have persistent scammers preying on this community,1231,u3ydaq,73,"Folks, a reminder that [Rule 3](/r/offmychest/about/rules) focuses this community's scope on providing emotional support only. We do not allow solicitation or material offers.

This means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay.

This community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. That is why the rules are strictly enforced.

There are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only.

cretoset,My dog was shot 6 times by police yesterday in her bed in my own home and I am filled with hatred and anger ,919,1c6ba4h,199,"I am a 18 year old male. My slightly younger brother has been in problems which I wont list with the police. My 4 year old pit was shot 6 times in her own bed during a police raid on my house yesterday. They not only deactivated the security camera system before the shooting but they also raided the house without a warrant but they got the warrant around an hour after my baby was killed. I have a lot of bad thoughts in my head right now and I know the officers name who murdered my dog. I want revenge but I know it isnt the right way to do this. She was the most innocent little girl and she paced around in her room after she was shot leaving a blood trail, i just cant get this image out of my head and i want to hurt someone for what they have done TO MY BABY GIRL. I cant imagine the suffering she went through i didnt get to say goodbye to my little baby i cant imagine how scared she was seeing random men come into her home just for her to be shot dead for no reason. Ive already hated cops and this, this is just the beginning of my hatred now. I dont care about the money my family is going to sue for this i want real revenge. I want these pigs to feel the same pain they have made me feel.

Big-Contribution7321,I ripped open my ex's belly in self-defense with a pocket knife. I was justified. He's alive and got convicted. ,288,1c6cb14,22,"This was in July last year. My ex-boyfriend (I’m 20, he’s 23) tracked me down when I was walking alone through the city, and in one deserted alley he jumped out in my direction.  He started swearing, threatening, and then came up to me and grabbed me by the throat and started choking me.  At that time I had a small knife in my pocket (the blade was about 3-4 cm (~1.5 inches) long).  I quickly took out the knife, stabbed him into the belly, pulled the knife up and pressed it into his belly up to the hilt.  He screamed, released his hands from my neck and looked down - at that moment I also looked at my hand, which his belly was pressing on, and a red stripe was visible under it. Then I twisted and pulled out the knife, he fell to his knees, groaning, holding his ripped open belly, and I quickly ran away from that place.

In the end, I was justified because I defended myself.  He was saved, but he was convicted.",1713366573.0,
ourladystears,I started to become disgusted by porn,856,1c62q0a,111," I started watching it rarely when I was 14-15 and I found it to be sexy and nice? But lately even if Im super horny, the moment I put a video to watch my mood is ruined. 
 The acting is so bad, the way women scream while the guy barely even touched them makes me cringe, even romantic amateur porn makes me disgusted. The way they show the genitals like its the most important part of the human body, the titles of the video using derogatory names to describe the women in the video, the amount of fetishes thrown in my face. When I remember the amount of cases where teenage girl who have been trafficked, their videos have been found on porn sites, not even dark web, literally sites accessible to everyone, so fucking disgusting to even think that its a pretty high chance I watched a rape video without realising. 
 And I fucking hate new age feminism for saying that porn is empowering, its not you stupid fucks. I have a friend and she was a prostitute, recently she stopped doing it and I can still see how traumatised she is, its not fucking empowering at all. All it does is to convince young women that the only way they can succeed in life is using their body. I don’t give a fuck about the amount of money they make because all retired porn stars snd prostitutes say that they regret it and this industry has left deep scars on their mind.

Difficult-Thanks-,My Ex Just Got Engaged,164,1c688sg,31,"My ex (M38) and I (F33) were together for eight years (2014-2023), and for the most part had a great relationship. We traveled, got dogs, finished our respective graduate programs, and both ended up in positions making six figures. There were definitely some issues, but over the years it was smooth sailing and we maybe had two/three big fights. 

We broke up in 2023 because I asked if he was ever going to marry me and he said no. By the end of the relationship, I definitely felt more like his mom (cooking, cleaning, pet care, etc. for both of us) and a best friend/roomate, not a romantic partner…but in my mind that was ok. In my opinion, friendship and companionship are what lasts for a lifetime relationship. Not to say I didn’t crave epic love and passion, but I was content with what we had and the future I saw for us. 

I definitely have my flaws, and alcohol played a big part in my headspace at the time (I’ve since stopped drinking)…but when we broke up I didn’t feel devastated. We parted on good terms, and I mourned the loss of my go to human. 

I hadn’t been single for longer than a week since I was a teenager, so I’ve enjoyed being my own person and a dog mom…without the expectations or happiness of another human to consider. Lately I’ve been lonely and know I’m definitely in some kind of a rut, but it hasn’t bothered me to the point of getting back out there. (I mean eww…Tinder?!)

Anyway, I just learned via social media that he proposed to the woman he started dating after me (they became “official” about 8 months after our breakup). And I feel…a lot of…somethings?

Anger that I wasted my 20s on someone who couldn’t commit to me the way I wanted and deserved? Sadness because I’m in my 30s with zero prospects, much less someone I love enough to start a family with? Annoyance that I spent years turning him into great life parter material (I’m talking personal hygiene, diet, dental care, support in buying a home, etc.)? A general sense of disbelief and inadequacy because she (42F) is worth marrying and I was not?

I’m happy for him, I genuinely am. I don’t want him back and I know I absolutely made the right decision ending it. But I’m just feeling this swirl of somethings I can’t quite describe. 

So…tomorrow I’m gonna start working out again, plan a trip to Mexico, and maybe start trying to “win” the breakup two years after the fact. 

P.S. This is kinda funny, kinda sad…but I was rewatching “he’s just not that into you” when I looked over and asked if he was ever going to marry me. What a cliche. 

P.S.S. I slept on the couch after he said he wasn’t going to marry me, and when he went to work I cleaned the house and left with all the stuff I could pack in my car and the dogs. When he called later to talk, I said “I’m keeping the dogs, dumbass”. Misquoted “legally blonde”. What a cliche. ",1713355923.0,
UnitNational7180,My wife randomly left me this morning!,1730,1c5uotd,435,"Back in September 2023, I purchased some land 3 hours away from where we currently live. My wife and I wanted to go see it and map out the area. I was very excited and proud so I made sure that day I took pics and documented the journey. I made sure that the dashcam on our car had storage and it recorded the whole journey. This morning after breakfast I grabbed my laptop and put in the SD card to take off the footage. My wife noticed and asked what was i doing and I explained what I typed here so far. She asked to see the laptop and started going through my files. She didn't go through the video files she was clicking random folders. I told her to please not delete anything before I go through it and I only said that after the laptop made a sound effect. She pushed it back to me and then sat there in anxiety. I asked her what was wrong and then she acted surprised to know it recorded audio too. She asked me about the dates and recording but what stuck out was when she asked what was the last time it was recording. I said it always records every time we start the car but she doesn't know the last time it recorded was back in September. The card was full after our journey so I put it behind my phone case for safekeeping until I had a moment to review it and dump it. Three minutes after her silence she randomly gets dressed and gets our daughter dressed. Right before they dashed out the door I asked her what was going on and where is she going because we normally plan for our days the day before. She said something along the lines of She was going to make a plan for our daughters. I know that her younger sister normally runs errands with her in our car. I think she told her something in secrecy that she never thought in a million years I would hear. I feel like it was so wild that it's marriage ending.

Cat_of_the_woods,I (28M) had sex with a married woman (33) and I feel so ashamed of myself.,188,1c64oyq,31,"I thought I was done with hooking up. It only left me feeling empty and feeling even less loved. I also felt bad because after hooking up, 9 times out of 10 I didn't want anything else to do with the woman so it's like I just basically used a person for temporary, primal satisfaction. 

I've been going through a lot lately. I'm living in a new city, still struggling with a new life of moderate-severe hearing loss, my previous company was restructuring and so now I'm working a temporary job I hate, I'm estranged from my mom (or maybe that's a good thing), and three weeks ago, I got into a brutal car accident. The car accident was the last straw which sent me into a nervous breakdown, especially since my car was totaled, I got a concussion, and am about to have a legal battle with the drunk driver. 

I needed something other than just a hug from a close friend or family member. I wanted to leave my close circle and find intimacy from someone I found attractive enough, to pretend I was in love. Sounds cheese I know.

So I downloaded some dating apps; I met some nice women and went on dates. I slept with two women and ironically I still talk to them. Then one day at the gym, this woman I see all the time and sometimes say hello to, gave me her number on the back of a gym pamphlet. 

I texted her and we later talked on the phone for hours. Long story short, we agree to meet up at my house the next night for sex. Not gonna lie, I really enjoyed it and she asked if she could stay so we could do it again in the morning. I told her I wasn't looking for a serious relationship before we had sex and she was cool with it. Her life wasn't too good either and she kinda wanted something along the lines of what I was in the mood for. We went on a date anyway to go check some stuff out at a festival. Later that day I went over to her condo where we showered together. I did look around for a bit and I didn't see pictures or anything, indicating a family. Then again, I was more focused on the food we were making and her. She later told me she doesn't usually go for younger guys, so this was a slight ego stroke as well.

Last night, she came over again after her shift at the hospital (we both work nights). We had sex again but she seemed not 100% into it. When I talked to her about it, she confessed that she's married. 

She told me that her husband is out of the country on a business trip and that he's a workaholic. He doesn't communicate very well and over the years has been very passive-aggressive with her. They stopped having sex two years ago and sometimes, her husband prefers to sleep on the couch. The last straw was when he said he ""sometimes doesn't even wanna kiss her knowing the stupid words that came out of her mouth."" Allgedly he apologized profusely and blamed it on depression and stress at work. Geez, what the F!

I told her I wish she didn't put me in this situation; it's just so wrong. Right now, idk what to even think. I've known people who've been cheated on and even if that guy is a jerk, cheating is never okay. ",1713342746.0,

He even shared that he has a fantasy about his girlfriend watching him cheat. However, just a few hours later, he described her as beautiful and emphasized his love for her.

fuzzlemuzzled,My cousin touched me inappropriately and it's making me disgusted in myself.,824,1c5rcsn,61,"I (20f) have a cousin (29m). It started when I was 9-10 years when this cousin started kissing me on lips and I didn't knew any better so I obliged.

When I got slight older like 13-14 I was understanding it was wrong so I tried distancing from him and avoid being alone with him but still having contact with him.
 
One day when I was 17 all the cousins were playing and took on a big bed but I was woken up when my cousin started touching my breasts but I kept my eyes closed, it caught me off guard. He started licking and sucking on it. It was an interesting feeling since I never felt that before so I didn't say anything.

Now everytime we meet somehow he end up doing it again and I didn't say anything.

Recently a few days back, he came over and we were chilling in my room with the cousin and my brother. And he started touching my breasts again. I closed my eyes and he thought I might've fell asleep then he lifted my shirt and did the stuff again when my brother left for a while. I could feel him jerk off next to me. 
When he was leaving he asked me to give him a hug and he started sucking my neck and grinding on me. He immediately backed off when my brother entered.

I know it's disgusting and when I think about it I feel very guilty and disgusted in myself. I shouldn't have let him do it. Idk maybe I was touch starved and I know it doesn't justify it. I feel horrible and I try to ignore the thought but it comes back to me.
It's equally my fault tho, I should've known better.

Edit: thank you for all the comments and support. I think I realise it's not my fault and I should stop blaming myself.
And I plan of confronting him first if he ever tries it again and avoid him at all costs.

Edit 2: As suggested by many people I talked to a trusted adult and it went well. I feel relieved that I wasn't judged and it was normal to feel the way I did and I'm trying to come out of it. I'm not sure I'm brave enough to report it yet but atleast I believe I can keep myself safe now knowing better. Thank you all for your precious advices.",1713301584.0,

BootyBabeCheerful,I lie about having my university degree and it got me a great job,25,1c6c2st,13,"I went to an Ivey league university in Ontario Canada right after high school. My marks weren't great but they were good enough to squeeze me in. I spent most of my time in University partying rather than studying but still managed to pass all of my first year classes. In my second year I skipped a lot of classes and was very lazy with the course work. My marks were terrible and I failed a couple of my courses. In my third year about half way through I dropped out and got a job landscaping.  
  
I did that for a year when I realized it really sucked and I began to regret not trying harder while I was in school. I figured I would apply to jobs that would normally require the degree that I would have gotten. I had spent the few years in school I was easy enough to make the timeline on my resume make sense and although I dropped out I had a decent knowledge of the area.  
  
The field I was attempting to enter is difficult start out in and it took a few months of sending applications to get an interview. The company I got an interview with (my now current employer) is an internationally recognized name in the energy sector. I was extremely surprised to get my interview. One of the documentation requirements was university transcripts and with an hour or two in photoshop I had my proof of graduation. I sent in the papers with the other required information and never heard anything back describing any problems with my records. I ended up going through three interviews in the process and received a position.  
  
I have have now been working with this company for almost 5 years. They provided all the necessary job training and nobody has ever questioned my education. I entered with a starting salary of $72,500 CDN and received annual raises.

inthesky_with_you,Thank you to the stranger who called out my partner’s verbal abuse at a member’s only club,203,1c5yzkw,6,"My *now ex* boyfriend took me into a corner of a very exclusive major city club/restaurant where you have to be a member. He sat me down to continue yelling at me. Which he usually does when he drinks too much. 

Most everyone is too afraid to say anything to him. He tips extremely well, he has an absurd amount of money - and in turn - power… He has yelled and screamed at me in public many times before. Calling me names, belittling me, accusing me, humiliating me… basically a never ending spiral of anger. The definition of emotional abuse. 
I sometimes feel like it’s my fault. Like I deserve it. 

*A guy I used to date (who I broke up with because we weren’t compatible) before I ever even knew my boyfriend existed - was at this same members-only restaurant. My boyfriend saw him in passing as he was leaving.  This was the cause of his anger towards me tonight. Because I should have known he would be there and I embarrassed him or something.*

A blonde woman passed us as my now ex was yelling at me. He had moved me into an isolated corner booth from our original central spot in the restaurant. He kept yelling at me until she came back minutes later. 

She told him that she had heard everything he was saying. And that he can’t treat someone this way. He can’t talk to *me* that way. She let him have it. 

THANK you for sticking up for me. For caring. For validating that I am not deserving of this. I needed someone (a witness) in my corner. Most people don’t say anything because of his financial power. 

I grabbed all of my stuff from his place this evening. I left. I am done because I can’t hurt like this anymore. I am not crazy or overreacting - he can’t treat me that way. 

I just needed someone to help me realize that I am not at fault. I am not delusional. I needed a witness who wasn’t going to benefit from his power. A stranger. 

He of course called her all the bad names, threatened to harm her, etc. 

The point of this, Off My Chest post, is to say ~ do not ever be afraid to speak up for other people. Even if you feel like it’s not your business (within reason). Sometimes, you can save someone from a bad situation.

Ecstatic-Bug1441,Ex dies and leaves a frigging mess,18,1c6a1qh,14,"I apologize in advance this story is a big shit show and I need to get it off my chest- please bare with me. 

My ex and I split up more then two decades ago and this relationship scarred me for life. 
I was 16 and he 28 when we met and I gave birth to our daughter 4 month before my 18th birthday. Make what you want with it. 

The rollercoaster relationship endet when my daughter was about 1,5 years old. 
He was a heavy drinker, violent and kept chasing other women while being with me. 

He met another woman und got her pregnant instantly as well  and that was the end of it. I was left with debt, 19 years old, no job or education, no place to live, nothing. 

I was lucky to have wonderful parents who did everything to help me stand on my own feet- which I did after a couple of years. 

Ex had moved in with the new woman and it was a pure horror story: she was as well a heavy drinker which led to their daughter being born with multiple health issues. 

For the sake of my daughter and also being put under pressure by authorities the ex and my daughter met every other week for ice cream and stuff, in the beginning it was also supervised by authorities. 

I‘ve never seen a single penny of child support from him, not one! He never supported his daughter or me for the sake of parenting. There only was attacks, insults and he made my life hell. 
My daughter and I moved away and I kid you not, the authorities made me pay for his train tickets and accommodation so he could come and visit his child. Background is that he had the alcoholic downfall, lost his job and endet up living on benefits while I started to make good money. 

The relationship with the new woman endet soon after and he fu**** off back to his home country. 
For many years we didn‘t hear from him. Every couple of years I received a call or a letter from him out of rehab. I understand it was part of the program to apologize to people. 
He kept disappointing my daughter, arranged phone calls or holidays but never turned up. My poor girl did not even once receive a birthday card or a Christmas present. It was so hard for her, also because her half sister got all this from him. 

My daughter grew older and after many more disappointments with her father she cut contact with him, this is 6 years ago while her half sister kept in touch with him. 

Long story short: via detours I received a phone call from a police officer in his home country. Ex was found dead in his flat and they were trying to find family to release his body to the morgue, take care of the funeral, aso. 
It actually hit me harder then I expected especially cause  I knew through friends about his excessive drinking and it shouldn‘t have come as a surprise. My daughter is totally heartbroken, she has a lot of regrets, it‘s so sad. 
So, I started making phone calls to friends from the past to help sort out his funeral and everything since my daughter and I are living in another country.  I even offered to help pay for it. 
Things are sorted now.. many years ago I made my peace with him and have no hard feelings. 
My daughter wanted to fly over to be there for the funeral and asked me to come as support. I offered to pay for stepsisters flight, too, since she is also living on benefits as well as her mother and simply couldn‘t afford it. 
I just received a message from stepsister that she will not allow me anywhere near the funeral after everything I had done to her father. She believes that after I ruined her fathers life he would not want me at his funeral. 
It is so grotesque and I somehow put it down to her grief that she reacts like that. 
My daughter and her are not speaking to each other over this and his life ends the same way he lived: in a big mess upsetting people. 
The bottom story is: he died lonely and sick, his body was found in piles of dirt and rubbish. He‘s leaving his eldest (my) daughter to deal with funeral and cremation and everything after he let her down all his life! 
It‘s a shit show…

Own_Neighborhood5764,Here's why your tow truck never showed up,9,1c6earo,8,"You called your insurance and filed a claim because you got into an accident, Your insurance tells you you'll hear from us in 15 minutes, Your insurance sends us a tow request, Our agents view the request, They Never call you, Never send you a truck, and leave you stranded on the side of the HWY. At Any given time - there are around 20 requests around the United States, waiting for a tow to be sent. Twenty people on the side of the road after an accident just waiting. 

I work request by request sending you the tow you've been waiting hours for because no one else did. All I'm supposed to do in my job position is answer agents questions, Not send tows. I am a supervisor so I just answer questions, but I do not oversee anyone, just answer chats and provide approvals.

When I have spare time, I work outside my job description to send you a tow. Because I hate the thought of you being stranded on the highway while the agents just fuck around. These are third party agents with minimal training and no drive to do a good job. Cannot blame them, they're paid pennies And just don't get any Decent training. I wouldn't work hard for a job that paid me pennies. Problem is our company just keeps laying off more and more internal agents (Me!) and replacing them with 3rd party, And those agents don't do their jobs because they don't want to or don't know how. 

So, I just clock in, Answer questions, Send you the tow you requested hours ago, And answer escalation calls (When you call back pissed because no one sent you a tow and you want to speak to a supervisor).

Every agent I see leaving you stranded, I report. It used to be a fireable offense, Now it's barely even glanced at. But I report them. I'm trying. I'm so fed up. I Will probably be laid off in the near future Unless my department of Internal Workers can save the company more money - which means low balling tow companies - then we will be seen as Valuable.

,My husband of 10 years sexted a coworker,429,1c5mui2,138,"Throwaway account. I just need to get this out of my chest.
It happened few months ago lasted few months.  They both can't say how it started or tell how long did it really last. He came and told me after coworkers husband found out when he looked at her phone. They both reassured me that nothing physical happened , they had the line set that this adventure, fantasy whatever they had is just over phone, text or pictures. My husband sent some videos of him and she sent some nude pictures. 
Husband told me he doesn't really know why he did it. It was one of those ego boosts?! 
I decided to stay and try to recover, try to get to the possible problems in our marriage with communication and almost demanded that he has to speak up and tell me if things aren't as he would want them to be.

But I still have those questions in the back of my mind - will he do it again, will he tell me if he does or will he even go further and physical with someone else? 

I love this man. He had my ultimate trust, and now I feel a bit betrayed. I expected him to come and tell me at least a better reason. If everything is great in our marriage, why would he do it?

Ma2340,I had sex with a guy and was so drunk I can’t remember it.,201,1c5st29,34,"I (26F) had sex with a guy (24M). It was kind of crazy. We were staying at the same hostel on an island. We had hung out on one night smoking, drinking, talking. The next day, I went on a 12 mile hike. Then, I went to a bar with friends and was drinking/dancing for a few hours at the bar. I had one shot, 1 cocktail, and two beers at the bar over the course of 3 hours. Then, I went back to the hostel and had two more drinks (canned margaritas). That is where I probably fucked up in terms of having too much to drink. I also smoked weed with this guy which I hadn’t done in like a year and I’ve never been a heavy smoker. Being on the island vacation made me really horny. I haven’t had sex in over 2 months and it’s been about 7 months since I had sex with someone I really liked. I remember us flirting and I even had texted my friend that I wanted to have sex with the guy. He also 100% did not force me to do anything because I remember wanting to do it and I also remember him asking me several times if I was okay and I kept saying yes. I remember us getting a private room together and walking towards it. Then, it’s blackout from there. I woke up in my own bed. When I woke up, I was wearing just my dress. I knew I was wearing a thong when I went out though so I was like where is my underwear? I also had a hickey on my neck. So, I saw him the next morning and I asked him if we had sex. And he said yes. And I told him I didn’t remember. And then he said he felt bad that I didn’t remember. I asked him if it was good and he said yes. I asked if he used a condom and he said yes. Then, I asked him why I woke up the next morning in my own bed. He said we were laying in bed together and I left very abruptly. That part about leaving made sense because I have ditched my friends when blacking out before to go home by myself. I don’t feel used in anyway. It was just awkward having that conversation with him and not remembering. And, again, he’s the first guy I was real interested in after a sex hiatus. I thought he was really cute. And, I wish I remembered how this went. 
I have his contact info but I was leaving the day after so I knew it wasn’t an experience I could have sober again. It wasn’t a love connection, just like, and we live far from each other.

I used to drink far more in college and not blackout or not blackout for as long. But in the past year, I’ve had like 4 blackouts months apart. It only happens when like seeking to get drunk which is in occasional social settings.

anarchocurious1917,I learned the truth about my ex and now I’m questioning my entire adult life.,445,1c5j6jo,21,"I apologize for the length… there is a lot to unpack.

About 9 months ago I (now 25m- 24 at the time) got out of a 6 year relationship with the girl who I thought I would marry (25f- also 24 at the time). We started dating just after we graduated high school. Things were perfect for the first 4 1/2 years up until she started grad school, where she started to develop a drinking problem. Whenever she started to drink, she would get to a point where she wouldn’t stop and then become so drunk she couldn’t take care of herself. 

Some people think I overreacted about the drinking, which is another can of worms unrelated to the point of this post. Here are some details so you have a better picture of the type of behavior I’m referring to. 

At first I took issue with the drinking because it was embarrassing. She would often get absolutely wasted in public to the point of not being able to walk without help, being loud and obnoxious, and needing to be babysat the entire night. Sometimes she would drink before going out to the point where she was too drunk to give the bouncer her ID. Sometimes she would get turned away from the first bar she went to because she had already gotten so wasted at her apartment. 

Things became much more serious when she almost drank herself to death one night. I wasn’t with her that night, but she drank an obscene amount of alcohol with some friends and then woke up in her bed in a pool of her own vomit. A couple weeks later, she got so drunk she pissed the bed (I was there for that occasion). It was at this point where I started to really convey to her how I thought the drinking was becoming a serious problem. I was especially worried because she would sometimes get this drunk when going around strangers in a college town, often times putting herself in extremely vulnerable situations. I loved her more than anything and didn’t want anything to happen to her.

We would have long talks about the drinking, about my concerns for her health and safety, and about staying in touch with me when she went out without me (by staying in touch, I just wanted her to let me know she was okay and alive). She would improve, and then every 2 months or so she would go out and then become unresponsive the entire night, and then text me the next afternoon telling me that she drank too much. This went on until she finished grad school. 

When she finished grad school, she seemed to be getting her life together. I helped her get a job where I work and thinks we’re going great… until she started going out drinking with her coworkers. Long story short, she fell back into her grad school ways and quickly developed a reputation for being a drunk at work.

Before anyone asks why I didn’t leave her sooner, it’s important to note that these incidents were spread out over a year and a half. We had a lot of good times between them and I ultimately wanted her to get better. When I graduated from college we went out with my friends and had a great night (which is now tainted for reasons I’ll get to).

 This all culminated at July 4th. She went to fill in for a coworker on a golf outing with a male coworker of hers. While she was driving there, we had a talk on the phone where I reiterated boundaries. She agreed and then told me she wanted to come over and stay with me that night, which I was looking forward to. We hung up. I then didn’t hear back from her for 7 hours. I got worried so I called her parents and asked if they had heard anything from her. Her father told me that she was supposed to let him know if she was staying in the place she traveled to for the golf outing. This contradicted what she had told me on the phone, so I became suspicious. I always trusted her as she had always been extremely vocal about her disdain for cheaters. Whether she called me after midnight to let me know she had too much to drink and would be crashing on her coworkers couch. In hindsight I feel like such an idiot.

The next day I gave her an ultimatum: she either stop drinking and treat me with the respect that I deserve after 6 years together or I’m done. We went our separate ways and then 3 days later she told me she wanted to go on a break. We ended up breaking up after 6 years, which was really hard as we were each others best friend(or so I thought). We decided that we would get luck every month or so just to check in and see how we were doing. As hard as it was, I learned to enjoy life more because the stress of the relationship was keeping me down more than I realized. Soon after I got accepted to law school. I was moving on and getting over everything well. She tried suggesting being friends with benefits which I turned down. This is when things w started coming to light.

 I ended up going back to work part time. We had an amicable relationship so I didn’t think it would be weird. She had three grandparents pass away within the span of a couple months and I had paid my respects to her family, which went well.

 Upon my return to work, I quickly learned that my ex is a psychopathic cheater. She has been more or less in a relationship with the coworker from the golf outing since we broke up. It was during this time while she was with her coworker when she tried being friends with benefits. She has been using the deaths of her grandparents to reel in other guys at work to sleep with. Most recently I learned that she fucked my (former) friend from work the night of my college graduation. She came on to him and did so in such a manner that makes me believe that this was something she was experienced in.

 It’s been 2 months since I learned all of this and I’ve been questioning my entire relationship with her, which lasted my entire adult life. I made many life decisions based on planning for our future and now I feel like I wasted my early 20s on a piece of human trash. Part of me now even questions if she was using her drink problem as a cover for cheating.

 I know I’ll be okay. I’m already getting better. This has all just shaken my confidence in my own judgement of character.

TLDR: ended a 6 year relationship due to my exes drinking problem. Learned that she was likely a serial cheater and used her drinking problem as a cover. Now I’m questioning everything from my time with her.",1713281889.0,
Repulsive-Option-646,My (19F) parents told me that I am not allowed to make decisions for myself and I should instead suffer.,46,1c5zym8,22,"I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that I have controlling parents with a warped sense of what being in a family entails. This all started when I proudly told my mom I was moving out and into an apartment closer to my university. I didn't ask for permission, I signed the contracts and informed her as a courtesy once everything was said and done. In short, she was pissed. She got even madder when I ended up filing my taxes by myself after she told me she wouldn't be claiming me as a dependant. She called my Dad and he pretty much told me that I had no right to decide anything for myself. I don't get to decide where I want to live nor do I get to decide when I do my taxes, even though I make enough money to realistically do both. He said my scholarship money and work money aren't for me to decide where I invest it. He told me I was stupid, lazy, and a huge disappointment for daring to live on my own rather than with my mom when I gave him the polite excuse for moving (being that the commute was too long and parking incredibly sparse). He said out of respect for the sacrifices they made for me, I should suffer silently rather than make the executive decision to make life convenient for myself since life wasn't convenient for him when he was in college. 

My mom later came and told me I was incredibly disrespectful for both daring to do my taxes on my own without their input and making the decision to move out. She screamed at me and demanded that I come back when the contract is over (I have no intention of doing so) and made a point to tell me that my friends are a bad influence on me so I should focus on her and drive her around as punishment for daring to decide by myself what I want to do with my life. 

At this point, it's very clear that I am the biggest disappointment in my family, but surprisingly I don't even care. I've been told repeatedly to tolerate: I should tolerate disrespect, tolerate being used, tolerate not getting to make basic choices like what I wear and where I go. Well, now they can tolerate my defiance. I don't care either way whether or not they're in my life, I'm just happy to be able to leave. I don't care how ""disrespectful"" I get along the way. No matter what insults they throw at me, it's almost empowering to now know I don't have to listen to any of it. I don't have to return no matter how much my mom screams and shouts, I don't have to drive her around unless I want to, and I don't even have to talk to them if I choose not to. I can live wherever I want and do whatever I want and they can do nothing but sulk, and I'm so happy for finally realizing this while I still have time to explore being in a college setting. I can't wait!

Secret_Telephone8022,My ex unalived himself. ,7,1c694vs,2,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I 23F was in a 4 year relationship with my ex 24M.

We met in college and dated for 4 years. We clicked immediately. The first 3 years of our relationship were incredible. We were close friends for 8 months before dating. Even after we started dating, I always felt he would be in my life for a long time, even if we eventually broke up.


Unfortunately, a little over a year ago he was in an accident and got a TBI. The last 10 months of our relationship was a nightmare. Once the initial phase of recovery was over, you couldn't tell on the surface that anything was different. However, his entire personality changed. He went from being an extremely loving, driven, loyal, gentle and caring person to someone I could hardly recognize.

He became verbally abusive, physically abusive, repeatedly cheated on me, had irrational thoughts, mental breakdowns, started drinking heavily which made all of his issues worse.


He punched through the wall in our apartment, punched through the window. Eventually he got angry at me over an argument about where to order takeout and he swung at my face. I ended up curled up in a ball on the floor while he screamed at me for an hour until he went into the bedroom and slammed the door. That was the last straw for me. I moved out the next day and went no contact.


I loved him, but I couldn't take it anymore. The stress of being with him was taking a serious toll on me. I tried to make it work for 10 months. I helped take care of him in his early recovery, I stayed by him as long as i could. After I left him, he repeatedly tried to get in touch with me. Made fake instagram accounts. Called me at least 50 times from a blocked number. I would open the instagram DM's but never responded, and blocked each new account he made.

From one of his burner instagram accounts he messaged me saying how sorry he was and he couldn't take the guilt anymore. He said if I didn't call him he was going to unalive himself. My therapist said this was a common manipulation tactic and to ignore it. Well 48 hours later, he did it.

Now I can't function. It's been 5 weeks and all I can do is lay in bed and cry.
I feel guilty because he was sick. Despite the fact that he became abusive, he loved me, and I know it's not his fault. I was already grieving the loss of who he used to be.

Proud_Emu_2735,How my life was completely ruined in 10 days,3,1c6eocf,1,"Before all these events, I was a guy who was extremely happy every day. I was studying, had a girlfriend, and trained regularly.

I went to the emergency room, they gave me something to calm me down, I went home, and fell asleep, thinking it was over. But the chaos was just beginning. Every day, all day, I had the most intense panic attacks, couldn't eat, vomited, didn't know what was happening, and knew this was a very serious matter.

And now, a serious hell follows. 10 days later, I get COVID. After that COVID, I develop a dysfunction of the nervous system and 10-15 symptoms (autoimmune disease). At that moment, I have severe mental problems, a disease that ties me to the bed. Every day I suffered from panic attacks and illness, and every 2-3 months, new symptoms due to the disease. I've reduced my anxiety somewhat, but depression is there, but the illness and everything worsened anxiety and staying indoors, a vicious circle. I can't leave the house because of the disease for which there is no cure.

CanIpleasebeacat,Since I was six years old I decided I would never have a child. I now have a newborn at 43 - what a mind and life change.,163,1c5nv1d,36,"I (F43) have an almost four week old newborn with my long term partner (M34) of almost fourteen years.

Long ago back in the 80's I decided I never wanted children, I was a bit over six years old.

I stood by this decision (hill to die on?!) for most of my life. I was firm on this choice always and open about it to family, friends, and later any partners I was with.

Then I met my current partner. We have a colurful, tumultuos, terrible yet beautiful past. We have gone through a lot - way too much to elaborate here...

Anyways.

He had always wanted children and I was certain I did not. It is a huge thing to have different views on in life and a relationship.

Over the years we discussed it, each of our views did not really change.

Time went by, I was in my 40's and the chances of me even being able to get pregnant were getting slimmer and slimmer.

I had been on birth control (Implanon bar) multiple times for more than a decade.

I didn't want to hold my partner back from ever having the chance of children and perhaps cause resentment between us. I expressed to him that if he wanted that chance he could find someone else who could perhaps give him that.

He chose that even if we were child free he wanted to be with me regardless.
That was like a whole 180° change of view.

That gave me a whole lot to think about... Over the years I had slowly considered having maybe just one child if possible for him. I guess I felt like I loved him so much I would make a sacrifice of my stance to give him that happiness and try my best to be a mother.

I was so scared and almost phobic of the idea of birth. I was also sure I would never be a good enough parent. Yet...

I made the decision to remove my last Implanon bar, and go without birth control and leave the chance of a baby up to fate. That was just before I turned 40 I think - I'm pretty sure it was 2019.

We talked and I let him know I was not about to track fertility or enhance and monitor any chance it would happen. He was totally cool with that.

Fate. Or chance?

In 2023 I thought at 42 I was going through perimenopause as I had not had a period for longer than a month, tbh I cried because I had a pang of sadness that I would now not ever have a child, it was contradictory to my past feelings and I got super emotional.

I was feeling weird, not myself and my partner sensed it too. We got pregnancy tests just in case because we wanted to see if that could be it. I also previously saw a doctor about missing a period and he said my chances of pregnancy were about 1 in a 100.

The day after I turned 43 (my birthday) we did the test. Positive. We did another two - both positive. We both walked around the apartment in a daze for the day - both so gobsmacked we had problems even speaking.

I realised I was actually pregnant and almost instantly I was fiercly hopeful I would keep and have this baby. 

My 180°.

I'll skip most of the pregnancy and birth story (it was hard, interesting, special, and involved a traumatic caesarean) as it is now done.

We have a son. I love him so much. Yet there is a part of me that has a little regret which I feel guilt over.

I will do my best to raise and love him and be the best mama I can be. I have to be responsible now for him, my partner, and myself.

I think this may have been the biggest change of my life. I am trying my best. Wish me luck...

PrimeJedi,I became disabled and started chemotherapy for autoimmune issues in 2020. My health is finally starting to improve and I feel guilty ,2,1c6f1c4,1,"I know it sounds unreasonable and stupid. I very nearly died in 2018 due to heart issues resulting in me getting a pacemaker, and then in 2020 I was diagnosed with a rare form of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as fibromyalgia. I've been fighting a lot, and I'm still far from any sort of remission, but 2023-2024is the first time where I've been able to be active, hold some semblance of a life, etc. I even started college,  a prestigious one, Berklee, for music for film and TV, and I've been happier than I've been in probably 6 or 7 years, if ever (which is saying a lot, I'm only 20 years old). 

But I feel guilty. I feel guilty because I see so many people go through the same thing I do, and they don't get a chance. It took me half a decade, a quarter of my life so far, just to push and push to have something to even live for, to be able to find happiness through my chronic pain, and I'm extremely grateful for it. But why do so many others get the same diagnosis, and never get the chance for their health to get better? Why am I finding more strength and energy at the same time that others in my situation are told they have only months left to live? 

And why must so many go through these health issues in the first place? It completely tore my life down, postponed my education, ended all my friendships, and contributed to my only long term relationship no longer working out. I've finally gotten over that hill, and processed it and accepted it, but it feels like the wound reopens when I see or hear someone else go through it. And hearing about someone either getting diagnosed when young or dying young tears me up inside. 

I had a former very very close loved one be diagnosed with cancer last fall. It was the kind that to my knowledge didn't spread, and was able to be removed before it became a chronic or life long thing. But still. When I found out, I spent 2 days doing nothing but eating the bare minimum and sitting there. I've spent a quarter of my life bitter that I have chronic pain that will never end, bitter over having my childhood ended early by the fear of nearly dying, and being ill, etc. And someone I used to be very close to ends up going through the same, even if they don't have the chronic pain part. I'd just sit there, imagining what they must be feeling, what their family must be feeling, and it made me sick to my stomach. 

I've finally gotten the strength to cope with my own health and start feeling better, and i...don't know how to cope when someone I care for goes through the same. It hurts. ",1713373110.0,

So late last year, me and my fiancee rented a house one block away from her brother so we can help them with their new born baby. They have to go to work twice a week and we work from home so we thought we can help them while his wife looks for a work from home setup as well. On our first month in the new home, the water supply was good and we can do all our normal stuff without running out of water. And then about two months later, the water suddenly became sparse and there are times we could'nt use the shower or even do laundry, it was miserable. It went on for months, we thought that it was just the location having trouble with water, we also told them about this issue and he said their water pressure is sometimes fine and sometimes not good. And then yesterday, I found out that my fiancee's brother meddled with our water supply, thinking that it will make their own water pressure stronger (they live 5 houses away from us) if he made ours terribly low which is absurd because theirs was already like that even before we moved.

I feel angry and resentful because I trusted him. We help each other out and we never had any arguments. This seems like a shallow thing for me to get mad about but I couldn't help myself.

ThrowRA_iks,I don't love my partner the way he wants me to,5,1c68mji,4,"Throwaway account, I just have to get this off my chest

My partner and I have been together for 11 years, I am his first love. I care deeply for him, but feeling frustrated and not really feeling heard.

He's always wanted intensity and passion, loud displays of emotion, while I am more laid-back in expressing my feelings, I want quiet love and to be loved for who I am. I've communicated that I have trouble having intense feelings the moment we started dating and he seemed fine with it at that time. 

I tried breaking up with him in the first months of dating because I simply felt that I couldn't meet his needs but he convinced me that it was probably due to my depression and then proceeded to try and 'fix' me. 11 years later here we are. Always having to repeat myself that I can't give him the intensity he wants, he feels it towards me but I don't feel it back. I love him, just not in the way the way he wants me to. Sex life is good the problem is strictly me and my lack of intense feelings. If I am home when he returns from work, he just wants me to jump into his arms and shower him with kisses the moment he walks through the door. I do kiss him when he comes home, he just wants more. I just don't feel as if I am enough for him.

I had a very traumatic relationship in the past that in a way paralyzed my nervous system, I went to therapy since then but unfortunately no matter who I dated, I just couldn't get a high from it anymore. I just knew when I loved people, but it was quiet love. No fuzzy feelings, no highs, no yearning, I just knew it was there.

I'm having trouble meeting his expectations for affection and love due to my past trauma and no matter how much I remind him of that, he seems to always 'forget' then proceeds to try and fix me again. I just can't be someone else and he never accepted separation as an answer.",1713357107.0,

d_2891,"After six years, I can finally let go!",2,1c6dcgr,0,"I was in love with someone for nearly six years. A friend arranged a blind date for us, and we met. I liked him, but he didn't feel the same way. We met a few times over the next six years, and we both knew about each other's feelings. We would sometimes meet for coffee and walk back to our respective homes. I often wondered why he didn't fall for me, as he always seemed like the right person for me. Fast forward to two years ago, and he moved to another city. Despite the distance, we continued to talk every day, and our bond grew stronger, turning into a platonic friendship.

Last week, I organized a fundraiser for Palestine. Let me give you some context. My best friend is from Palestine. She came for higher education, completed her degree, and then went back to her homeland. She is like a family to me, and we are still in touch with each other. However, due to the current situation, we can't talk every day. She has already lost her home, and now she is living in a tent. It breaks my heart to think that anything can happen to her at any time. There was a time last November when I couldn't reach her for almost ten days, and I cried every day, thinking the worst.

So I have been working on this fundraiser, constantly posting on social media, sharing stories, and sending individual messages to my close friends, asking if they were interested in donating. I also asked my 'platonic friend' if he was interested in donating. I said to him, 'Hey, even if you can't donate, can you please share the link so that more people can know about this?' However, he replied in a rude manner saying, 'Don't ever ask me to donate to your Palestine-Israel thing. I am not donating.' Many people rejected before but I was taken aback as he was the only one who responded in such a tone. I mean, he knows how important this is to me, yet he still responded in such a way.

I have always felt a strong connection between us that I couldn't break. I used to complain that God was unfair for not letting us be together romantically. I just feel like the connection is no longer there. Suddenly, he is not attractive to me anymore. I thought the obsession I had with him would last forever, but it disappeared in a second. If someone can't be empathetic towards my best friend's plight, how could I imagine dating them?
Now, I understand why we never became a couple. 
Maybe I'm overreacting, but the emotional baggage of unrequited love that I've been carrying for so long has finally disappeared. I'm happy that we didn't become lovers, and I can focus on my friendships and the causes that matter to me the most.",1713369098.0,

I have made many more friends at this job. 

Turns out my friend and 2 other colleagues (whom I also consider friends) I work with also applied for this role. I’ve never been in this position and it’s eaten me alive. 

I struggle hard with self esteem but I’m at a place where I’m finally ready to start interviewing for jobs and putting myself out there after a few years of a heavy depressive episode. The thought of interviewing for the same role my friends are pining for makes me feel highly inadequate and undeserving of this role. I feel like giving up before giving it a shot. 

My best friend had their interview yesterday and said it went well. When asked the final question “why should we pick you?” my friend responded with “I’m funny!” And they got a second interview. So yes. It went well. 

I’m happy for them, I want my friends to succeed. I have my first interview tomorrow and if I don’t land a second interview it’s gonna be such a blow to my self esteem. If I can’t beat “I’m funny” I’ll honestly feel like a joke. No offense to my friend, they’re charismatic and very easy to talk with, so I could see that phrase working for them but not someone like me.

My mother has been out of the picture since I was around 8, and the only respite I get from being at this house is the one night a week where I am allowed to spend the night at my grandmothers.

The incident happened last night, where I had gone out into the living room to tell him that I heard raccooons getting into our trashcans outside. Me exiting my room was unusual because once I head off to bed I always stay there. He got up from his chair, grabbed a flashlight and said he was going to scare them off. I stood at the door, watching him for a few seconds because I wanted to see the raccoons, before turning and walking back to my room. As I went I shot a glance at the tv, which is connected to his pc, and saw that one of the 3 tabs open was a porn site. The site logo was an ""X"" and the tab said ""Teen seduces.""

He's been watching porn a lot recently, I know because he tries to turn the volume wayyyy down, but forgets that walls are thin and my yearing is better than him. I know that viewing this stuff is unfortunately common amongst the male population, especially the single ones, as my father is. It just grosses me out that he's watching videos of girls right around my age. I also know that most of the videos under that category are gross stepdad stepdaughter stuff. Gross.

I think my past sexual trauma is causing my mind to make this issue more serious than it needs to be. He's given no prior indication that he would ever do something to me, plus he's a conservative independant fundemental baptist, and makes me go to church with him 3 times a week.

He asked me to be his gf but I said I want to date him in a non exclusive way till the time I feel that we both align (I have had bad relationships due to jumping in them skipping much of dating stage). He initially cared a lot for me, like remembering all my medicines, and talking to me every night after work, or cooking for me, dropping me to home, coming for my open mic performance (another friend asked him to come as well though) and I also reciprocated the same. I organised a lavish candle light dinner for him at a high end restaurant, I also made a lot of similar efforts, supported him when he felt low, cooked for him, tried to give him self confidence and told him ways to get better. However, my trust for him was shaken when he didn’t really defend me when his sister talked rudely to me after snatching his phone in front of him because I called him when he was out with her for a function and I didn’t know that. The second instance that triggered me was when he bought a house with loan on his name with father and sister making downpayment. The reason was that he isn’t making much right now to afford a house loan, and his parents want him to marry someone of their choice. Third thing that triggered me was his sister’s extreme interference in every thing, especially his life and her constant comments about me based on my LinkedIn like anyone could write articles like I have written, or that I don’t have a good background, or that I can be a gold digger. Note that I come from an upper middle class to rich family and he comes from a lower middle class family. The next was lack of boundaries within his family regarding anything and his lack of spine in creating any borders. Like in one instance, his neighbour took my date night pictures with him, and sent it to my guy’s mother indirectly, and he did not confront his neighbour about it which he should have. The next was snide comments regarding how much I spend on makeup and how I have only travelled in flights and not in trains like he has. However the last straw was that when he made excuses to not communicate much, and said once in a call that I should pursue other guys that want to date and keep him at the lowest priority because they are better than him. This irked me and mentally I have made my mind from that day that he is not the guy I want. Also he is shifting to other place which is my hometown and also a metropolitan but I live in other metro city, so long distance is not a problem but combined with so much issues with communication and family dynamics being so damaged I am considering to get out of it.

from me and damage the group. I was also diagnosed with major depressive disorder so I want to keep stresses at a minimum and I require more support than normal which I am not getting. So what should I do?

About 2 years ago, I found a job after a year of unemployment and moved out of my mom and stepdad's house to a new city. My mother and stepdad supported me during this time, and I'm grateful for that and that got to live with my half-sister, who is 6 years old for a while. But i need to move for my job.  
Recently, my stepdad cheated on my mom. She has been a stay-at-home mom for my sister since last year (she was the only income the family for years while my stepdad was waiting to find a good job) and now he wants to kick her out. Since she has no money and they aren't married, she asked for my help, and I tried to help her.  
She needed new teeth for job interviews, and I spent 3k on those. She calls me every day crying, and I support her during those calls, even sending her money when I can. However, she keeps trying to make me spend more and makes me feel guilty when I can't.

  
Soon is my sister's birthday party, and since her dad is buying her a trip to EuroDisney, my mom is pressuring me to go on a trip to London for the three of us. I tried to suggest another country closer by, but she insists on London, saying, 'But your sister is excited to go to London.' The price of just the flight is at least half of my salary, and I just moved into an empty apartment with my boyfriend.

  
This comes after another discussion about money. I offered to pay for a meal for the family for the birthday party, and she called me about renting an entire place and having a party for the children, saying it wouldn't cost much more and since I was already offering. After I said no, that couldn't. Two days later, she sent me a message with a photo of a school photo bill reservation without any explanation. I just exploded.  
I'm new in my career path with a horrible salary of only $1,200k and I live in an expensive city where $450 goes just towards rent.

  
I feel like she is pressuring me too much, and I don't know if it's just the eldest child syndrome. Between the calls, crying, talking about how bad everything is and how she's going to end up on the streets, and then complaining that my little sister is sad and needs her birthday to be perfect—I just can't handle it. I want to block her, but I can't. I'm her psychologist, her bank account, and she makes me feel guilty every time I say no.

Hefty_Career_5581,I feel like I tried to rape my ex boyfriend years ago TW: rape,2,1c6h6bn,0,"
Hello! I am sorry if this is long and messy, I have been obsessing over this for a while. Thank you for reading!!

When I (f22) was 18 I was with my then boyfriend (at the time 28) at a party with some friends. We got really drunk and had sex in one of the rooms, all was good and consensual and later we wanted to go to sleep. When we went to sleep in one of the rooms I started kissing him and he told me he was tired and we would go to sleep now and I think I kissed him again, maybe going on top of him, trying to seduce him. He told me we would go to sleep now and I think I stopped trying at that point, I hope so. The next day I apologized profusely to him and told him I should have stopped when he told me he was tired and that it really wasn’t okay. He told me I don’t have to apologize and it wasn’t a situation like that. I told him that he had already told me no and I should have stopped, he thanked me for the apology but told me I really shouldn’t worry about it. He told me that I am really aware of his boundaries and he really appreciates it in our relationsship. After that I let it go and we continued our relationsship. 

This topic has come up again for me like a year ago when I started to talk more about my experience of rape as a teenager and I suddenly remembered this situation with my ex boyfriend and started to completely spiral again. After talking it through with my therapist I decided to ask him how he feels about it and to apologize again. We aren’t friends now but we ended on good terms and I asked him if I could talk with him about ya situation that happened between us that I have been really worried about. When I started to talk about the situation he immediately told me, “oh but (my name) that was nothing, don’t worry about it. He said you were horny and I was tired, you were drunk and annoying but you didn’t do anything bad. You weren’t aggressive or anything in that direction. Thank you for the apology but you have nothing to feel guilty for. “ we talked a bit more and that was it. 

Obviously I’m not going to contact him again about this. I didn’t hurt him in any way he has made that clear and I believe him and have to let this go.

But everytime I start speaking about my own rape in therapy I start feeling immensely guilty about this situation because I just can’t see the difference. I was raped or coerced (I don’t really know what to call it) when I was 15 by a 26 year old guy that I met when I was 14. We had kissed and made out a few times.and one time I went to his place at night. He undressed me and tried to put his duck inside of me and I told him sno and he stopped and told me I am being unfair. We went to sleep. The next day he tried to talk me into having sex with him for hours and I always refused. Being 15 and a virgin I didn’t recognize that he was being manipulative, telling me that I was being prude and that there’s nothing wrong with having sex and that he just want a to make love to me . I always told him notand that I don’t feel ready. At some pint we were kissing and he put my hand on his dick and moved my hand to show me I should masturbate him and I did and he suddenly took me on top of him and put his duck inside of me and started spanking me. I froze in shock and didn’t know what was happening. After some time I came a bit ofusca of my shock and told him I have to pee and went to the bathroom. I was panicking and when I came back to the room I didn’t speak for a while. It took me about 2 years to actually realize what happened with him and that it wasn’t okay. He didn’t hold me down, the was no force or thread involved. I still conside this rape and deal with ptsd and fear of sex to this day because of it . I froze a and had made it clear before that I didn’t want to have sex.

And now I just keep thinking about that my boyfriend could have frozen and I could have raped him. He wasn’t harmed but I tried again after he said and just because he wasn’t scared doesn’t mean I didn’t act like my rapist. If I would have been in the position of my boyfriend I think I would have been scared. I don’t know. Or maybe there was enough trust between us and maybe I wouldn’t have been scared. I really don’t know what to think. I know the important thing is that he wasn’t harmed and I am so grateful for that. At some point I had convinced myself that he was completely traumatized by me. 

I just feel like I acted like a rapist and was lucky that nobody was hurt and it feels wrong that he is telling me I did nothing wrong .

On the other hand I am afraid that I exaggerated / am overreacting to what happened to me as a teen and that it wasn’t actually rape and just a misunderstanding.

goldensunshine888,My partner deals with depression & its affecting our immigration process. I just wish he could do what needs to be done.,1,1c6h5w3,0,"I just want to say, I love this guy more than anything, and I don't want to end our partnership. I knew when I married him that being with someone who has depression has its difficulties. I believe these difficulties are worth it. We have a great relationship.

I'm Canadian, he's American. We made the decision about a year ago for me to immigrate down there. We had our first step of immigration approved in January, and we still haven't moved forward.

He has to file his taxes for 2021, 2022 + 2023. We're past the 2023 deadline now so he has to get an extension.

I'm just so tired and frustrated. I have to go back to Canada, because I'm here as a visitor. I'm tired of being in limbo. I'm tired of feeling like i'm pressuring him to get stuff done.

I feel like it's also on me. I didn't look over our process properly last year, so I wasn't aware that we needed his taxes submitted. If I was, I would've encouraged him to get them slowly done throughout the year.

But it's almost 6 months past our approval date. I should've had my greencard by now. I wish I was settling down and looking for a job here at this point. My family keeps asking me if I've gotten my interview date yet. I don't want them judging or shaming him, so I've lied to them about what's going on. I've told them we've submitted everything and we're just waiting for our date, it should be here any day now... been telling them that for months.

I know he's doing his best and I know he feels like crap about it.

I'm just so frustrated I want to cry. I have no one I can share this with, and I don't want to unload on my husband and make him feel worse.",1713378181.0,
throwra_doilikehim, Do i F23 like M27? What is this comfortable magnetic feeling?,1,1c6h12i,0,"


I’ll start by saying that i have almost 0 experience with men, never had a boyfriend, never went on dates. Never even had a first kiss lol i just had lots of flirty encounters on nights out and etc but always rejected them and i just never let kissing or hookups happen. 





People never believe me when i tell them so, cause i am perceived as attractive and look like a ‘maneater’.




If ur asking yourself why i never experienced any of the stuff above, its just a mix of life situations and eras and also a personal choice cause i never genuinely liked someone, besides one guy in 2022 but he was only interested in hooking up so nada. 







Ok now to the real issue here;



In 2022 i started going out to clubs and i noticed this guy A, who was always there with his friends. He caught my eye because of his looks. 
We had some interactions and he also added me on insta but things got weird, idk. Anyway he stopped texting me and we lost touch and he also stopped saying hello when he saw me. 





Fast forward to exactly one month ago, i end up at a bar with A, a mutual acquaintance and my bestie. 
We both acted as if it was our first time talking.
We mainly talked to each other and things were lowkey but highkey flirty… I knew he thought i was hot.
After the bar closed he proposed the 4 of us go to a hotel for an ‘after’ but they were all fully booked. 





The weekend after we see them again at a club but A leaves early so our interactions are almost limited to nothing. 




The weekend after that we end up hanging out again, and we also go to an after together. 
I won’t talk about the details, but again, the flirting got more obvious. Especially in moments where we were completely alone. 
By flirting i mean things like spraying our perfumes on each other, him telling me i look good, saying he likes my hands and hands are things he finds important in a girl etc. 




When we laid on the couch, with me next to him and my bestie next to me, he also touched my leg. I kinda let him, kinda removed his hand. I also felt like at one moment he was ready to kiss me but i didn’t let it happen. 





And then finally this last weekend… We randomly meet again. We were 5. We somehow manage to stand at the same table with everyone but kinda exclude ourselves from the others. We talk in each others ears and what i felt last month, when touching him, is now 10 x times stronger. 



Its like some kind of magnetic pull. Its so satisfying. In those moments i felt such a need to be close to him and touch him it just felt so right. 


Mind you, we were just talking and updating each other about our week and etc. At some point he tells me to go outside with him so that he can smoke a cig. (Again, i noticed he creates situations to be alone with me) and we just held hands to go outside which is so unnecessary but it just… happens?





Anyway, after a while we end up alone again in another room at this bar, cause he was smoking again and asked me for my perfume. Which was an excuse i guess. 




I end up hugging him out of nowhere. He tells me i am super emotional and i have a wall around me that needs to be teared down. 


And then he said “if we would kiss it would be absolutely insane”. And i asked him what he meant. We sat down on a couch and he put his hand on my leg, said “do u feel this? Look how ur breathing changes when i touch u, you feel it right? You feel the energy, u feel whats going on?”



I don’t quite remember what i said, cause i was drunk, but i told him i think i do feel it. He then told me i should ask him if he is attracted to me. I laughed and asked. He said yes thats why this is happening, this feeling etc. And then he repeated that if we’d kiss it would be out of this world. 



He finally asked for my number, which took him a month btw. After that we got interrupted. 


And shortly after we all went home. (He texted me the whole day on Saturday but then nothing lol) 




He does know i never had a boyfriend nor anything else and when i told him that again, while he was telling me he is attracted to me, i asked him “but u do believe me when i tell u i have 0 experience etc” and he said “i do but we’ll see with time if i can trust what u say” OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. He also told me he’ll never touch me if i dont want to. 




The thing is… do i like him? Its weird that i don’t feel nervous with him? My heart is not racing like crazy? Cause these were symptoms i had with my first real crush two years ago. 




I feel weirdly comfortable with him and the touching, wanting to be close, flirtiness seems to come so natural. I think i never felt something like this? It got more intense each time i saw him. 



But i don’t understand why i am not acting crazy head over heels like i was with my other crush (in my mind and body i mean).
I am way calmer and i feel good. Also the magnetic pull kind of thing i felt this last time i spoke with him was something i still cant explain to myself. 






Also, most men that have approached me have been way more ‘direct’ with me and straight up flirted HEAVY and initiated physical touch immediately. 
But not A. Its been gradual and its been ‘clean’ asf if u ask me. 
I really think he is attracted to me but of course i can’t be sure of how much and if it’s anything worth my thoughts in that sense. 




I already told myself i would let him kiss me if he tries to. 
And just to clarify, i am not looking for a relationship. Its not my priority so if he doesn’t want a relationship thats maybe even better for me lol cause i dont see myself there.  




Any insight on this situation is much appreciated.

She will randomly start fights with me in ways that are not appropriate or cool. Last night I took a photo I liked of her and asked her if I could post it online. She started yelling at me about how I never take good photos of her. It got really bad. This is the third or fourth time this week that she’s turned a minor thing into a huge fight. It started happening last summer and it just keeps happening over and over again. At first, I thought there was something we needed to hash out, but slowly I noticed that she would sabotage the conversation if we ever got close to talking about how the argument started and why things got so heated.

So I guess we’re breaking up 🤷‍♂️. I’ve also lost many of my friends because they got into fights with her too (admittedly I think they weren’t being nice to her) and now I’m gonna be solo: can’t hang out with her friends either.

I told her that I wasn’t mad because I didn’t feel like it would be fair to be mad if i didn’t communicate my feelings with her. But that it kind of hurt my feelings when she and my stepdad would make games out of guessing what i was going to eat when they would go out to eat without me and my son. (We had just moved in prior to covid after a divorce). She immediately threw her hands up and asked what the hell i wanted from her, “to kill my husband?” She said. I just looked at her bewildered and said noooo… i just wanted to let you know that it bothered me and if you guys could please be mindful because i’m trying to have a healthier relationship with food and being teased isn’t helping. (They had previously invited my son and i on a vacation, and everyone got pizza. I started with one slice and everyone else started with two. I went to grab a second one and my stepdad said loudly at the restaurant, “everyone hurry up and get yours before she eats it all”. I had just lost 65 pounds in 6 months eating 800 calories a day). She stormed off and came back to tell me how everything is all about me and my feelings (this was literally my first time ever approaching her like this due to my therapist encouraging me). She then told me that people are inconsiderate of her too and to “Stop obsessing over your relationship with me.” I never felt that i had. I didn’t speak to her for days. She tried to apologize the next day, blaming it on her glass of wine. But ever since then, i get mad at myself every time i open up to her and she responds viciously. Like i should have known better. She asks me questions and then gets irritated about the responses. Shes practically taken my son from me in order for her to be willing to help me get him to school so i can work and live on my own. She wanted his stuff there as a comfort for him but doesn’t hesitate to make snide remarks about me not having things for him at my apartment when he comes over. I cant say anything about my life without her comparing it to her life and belittling my problems. She’s told me that i make everything worse in front of my son. She told me i get in the way and ruin their routine.. that i should leave whenever my son is acting up. Shes made me take down facebook posts about my life experiences due to how they make my family look and forced em to send certain people apologies for posting them. People they want to impress. I honestly just don’t feel like she loves me like a mother should. I would never tell my child what she told me. Now i just don’t even want her in my life but my son likes being at her house and i feel like i would be making him loose out on a lot of opportunities if i cut her off.. not to mention, i cant get him to school or afford to pay for someone else’s help. I feel stuck and unsure of what i did to deserve her hatred. Of course theres more to the story than i can ever type out without writing a novel.

sorrisodeputa,my name is Henrique and i'm an alcoholic,1,1c6ghnr,0,"i'm a 19 year old brazilian. i also happen to be gay. when i was 3, my mom died one week after my birthday. i have no memories of her and that really makes it hard for me to live knowing i was her youngest son, the youngest in the entire family, and that everyone still talks to me about how they miss her and the amazing person she was. and i was the one who had less time knowing her. 
so there's that. my father is amazing and devoted his life to take care of me and my brother. that being said, he's also kind of a health nut, and when i was 7 he put me on a diet. i understand it's good for your children to eat healthy but that diet was really restrictive. plus, my brother has a naturally skinny body, like my mom. i was never really chubby, but my body type is more like his. italians who have larger hips, larger thighs and arms, as my family says. so, we would weight ourselves every week and every kilogram i had more than my brother was the cause of him getting angry about me gaining weight. it's been long since that but i developed severe body dysmorphia. i can count on 5 fingers the last time i was shirtless in front of anyone. i am terrified of sex  because i was taken advantadge of at 15 when earlier in the party, when i was sober, i said no multiple times. however, when i was very high and drunk it just happened. my only relationship was one sided and very toxic 
when i was 11 and heavily bullied and depressed i used to put a very slight of the booze my dad had on the juices id make on the blender. the first time i got drunk was also at 11, when one day i decided i wanted to know what getting actually drunk was like. i remember spinning in the living room listening to 7/11, specifically the part where she says ""hold that cup like alcohol"" at 13 i started drinking more often and smoking cigarettes. being the only gay kid in a big city in a country as unequal as brazil meant i went to private school. and it was like a bubble where everyone who went to private schools just knew each other, mostly in social media. it was only at 14 that other people started coming out, and i was outed at 11. so it was like i took all the burden. the girls loved me and the guys either really hated me or treated me as a joke. and they were vocal about it, ive once been told to ""make like my mom and die""
at 14 i stopped going to school because of my depression. i got addicted to cigarettes and would often drink too much at parties. i also started smoking pot more often. i literally didnt go out the house except to hang out with the guy i was obssessed with and partying. i ended up going to a public school, where they couldn't hold me back a year because of my psychiatrist's note. 
this was in 2019. i wanted to go back to school in 2020 but then the pandemic happened and i was so fucked in the head the last thing i thought of was going to school. so, cut to 2022, im 17 and get my unearned high school degree. i decided on impulse to go to law school and got in. 
cut to 2023. im 18, a legal adult, who hasn't been in a school environment since 14. so adapting was really hard, but i decided to become a public defender (which is hard to be in brazil) 
in march 2023 a guy sent me a bunch of explicit and homophobic messages. i was in class and i didn't know who he was, and then he took a picture of me and sent it to me. it was terrifying. i started drinking a bottle of wine a day. that escalated to much more.
they did suspend him for 15 days, but i only found that out 5 months after. so i was really angry at it for a while and the stress of college got to me.
since i started daily drinking its like a thing that comes and goes. 
ive been diagnosed with bpd, depression, anxiety and adhd. on meds and therapy to this day. i did make a lot of progress in my healing but i relapsed on booze a few weeks ago and this week im sober and it feels like torture. so thats my story i guess
if you're wondering where my dad was during this, i tried to lie and hide it from him but he really was/is worried about me and tries to prevent my drinking on week days in any way he can. im a fucking liar but anyway",1713376593.0,

Gabriel_Moraes69,Married to best friend: A tale of regret,1,1c6gbxd,0,"So there was a friend of mine in school; we used to be good friends. Her childhood was not that good because of her father; he physically abused her out of frustration. That's why she became so rude, loud, and stubborn. However, during those times, I was her good friend. In the 9th standard, she had her first boyfriend, who I initially thought was a good guy. But after one year, he also turned out to be abusive and typical. Despite this, she tried to continue the abusive relationship because she was loyal. After 4-5 years of effort, he left her, which was a good thing for her. But she developed psychological issues after the breakup, first from her father, then from her boyfriend. Still, she thinks she is strong and independent, but inside, she is broken. She works hard, does multiple jobs, earns a lot, and changes her personality, but deep inside, the damage is already done.

When her relationship is not going well, we start talking again. So, I suggest her to leave him, and slowly she tries to leave him. After leaving him, I became her only best friend. She shares everything with me, and almost after 2 years of the break, she decides to propose to me. If I say no to her, she would be totally broken. So, I took one day to decide. In my mind, I don't know about her childhood traumas or psychological issues; she overthinks a lot. But at that time, I only knew about her breakup, nothing else. I thought she is wife material and loyal, so I accepted her proposal. However, my family doesn't like her, so I took 1.5 years to convince my family for her. During these years, we were close, but we fought a lot. At first, I thought it was normal in a relationship, but the intensity of the fights increased every time. I felt she was very dominant, getting what she wanted, and I couldn't say no to her. But again, I thought it's because we are not married yet; once we get married, everything will become smoother. However, I was wrong. 

After marrying her on the day of the nikkah, problems worsened. I tried my best to make things smoother, but she was very dominant, doing everything she wanted. On the first day of our marriage, we had a fight, and she asked for a divorce. I was shocked, but I handled the situation because the very next day we were going on a honeymoon. Our honeymoon didn't go well either; we had fights there too. As we came back to our city, the problems worsened even more. 

On one side, there is my family, and on the other side, there is my wife. In our culture, it's normal for the family to create some problems for the new girl, but usually, these problems subside. However, not in my case; the problems were getting worse. After four months of struggle and sacrifice, I realized that my wife couldn't live here with my family, so I had to take her somewhere else. I couldn't tell my family that I was taking her to another place, so I lied to them, saying I had a job offer in another city, and I had to move there with my wife. My family agreed, and after four months, my wife and I moved to another city. But the problems remained the same or even worsened. I did everything to please her, sacrificing my job, career, family, and friends, yet she was not happy with me. She would often misbehave or even abuse me. It's been almost 1.5 years, and She wants a separation, I don't know what to do.",1713376212.0,

Just yesterday, a lady who seemed nice in the bus called me a slur under her breath just because of my appearance and it tipped me off so much, I had to come here and make a post.

For context, I live in Italy and have been here for 7 years, it is fairly known that tensions are currently high against foreigners in italy because of illegal immigration.

There is rascism in every country, I know that, I even ignore remarks online, because I know not all people are ignorant like them, but yesterday while I was on the bus going home, the lady sitting behind me while taking on the phone called me ""sto musulmano di merda"" which means this shitty muslim, which makes me wonder how could she say that while i am in hearing distance, was she expecting me to react ?

Now, remarks like that would not get under my skin but I had a long day of work and was already stressed out because I had to study.
I wish I had the courage to confront her but I was too much of a coward, so i shut my mouth and went home silently.

I cant seem to stop thinking about the moment about how a person can judge my entire life and personality just based off of my religion, why would she have a problem with me if she deosnt even know me.

Painting_Nerd1988,I want nothing more than to find the love of my life,8,1c63hjo,3,"I’m 35 years old. Divorced. I make 6 figures. The only debt I have is my car. I live on my own. I paint for fun- I work in finance. I want nothing more in life to find that best friends, committed to each other forever kind of love. I’ve met women who I could see spending my life with. I don’t fit the mold of who they find attractive. I’m working on becoming more physically attractive. I’ve lost 40lbs. I probably have another 30 to go. I know romantic love comes down to a combination of physical and emotional attraction. I’m kind- I make an effort to be kind to everyone, irrespective of whether or not they can do anything for me. Kindness is its own reward in my book. As I get closer to middle age (I’d argue I’m already there), the chance of finding that love feels less and less likely. I know we are supposed to be happy on our own, but life just doesn’t have that spark for me alone. I often get lost daydreaming about finding that gentle and kind woman I want. At night the lack of romantic love sits heavy on my chest when I’m in bed. Wherever you might be, future wife, I hope we find each other. I hope we don’t lose each other in passing. Until then life feels like a slow march towards death. I’m sad waiting and watching the years pass on. ",1713337675.0,

She said its because i told her to khs and i remembered that instant and i felt super sorry. She also told me she had issues with suicide and i wasnt aware of it. I apologized and told her i'd make it up to her and we moved on.

Pre-pandemic I felt like there were way more things I actually liked to do that people actually attended. There were lectures at a reasonable time, discussion groups, lots of groups in my field, and just way more free educational opportunities.

Now, I feel like this place just exists for the gym rats and outdoorsy people only. It seems like almost everyone I meet is either into board games/card ganes/DND, hiking, offroading, volleyball, gym, etc (none of my interests). I just don't feel like people with my interests fit in here.

Festivals seem composed of just eat, drink, watch which is hardly very exciting. There isn't a lot of interaction to it that isn't passive.

I see all the time to do things I love in AZ to meet people, but how can I when the things I love here are only attended by elderly people or I am one of the few attendees?

I’ve been bartending/serving at a casino for a couple years now in a small town, and it was also my first time ever being inside a casino. Where I grew up, gambling is mostly illegal so I was never around it and knew very little about its culture. Cue back to today, I have watched people sit at one game for longer than my shift (typically 10-12 hour shifts), shamefully admit to me they’ve emptied their bank account into this place, vomit and shit themselves at the same time, and succumb to the vicious addiction that gambling offers. The worst part is, it’s really not even the players’ fault. To an extent, sure, everyone has the ability to make a choice, but from what I’ve seen casinos are very good at luring people back in with “rewards” and “gifts” (such as free meals and hotel rooms) which they end up paying for anyway through the games. Corporate suits don’t care about their management team, and my managers don’t care about us lower level employees, but working there is a separate story on its own. It’s just a vicious cycle, and I can’t wait until I finish school and move on from this strange time in my life. Obviously this is very opinionated, and I’d like to say again I have nothing against people who gamble, but it truly does pull the deepest depravity out of some where you’ll see nowhere else.

i-feel-guilty-ta,I don't find my boyfriend good-looking,2,1c6fhfq,1,"Feeling a weight of guilt lately. I truly love my boyfriend, and I'm attracted to him as a person, but if I’m honest, I don’t find him physically attractive. Before we got together I thought appearances were very important to me, but his amazing personality completely changed my outlook. It’s what’s kept us tight for five years now.

Lately, we’ve been facing challenges. After going through an abortion a while back, we’ve been dealing with intimacy issues because of pregnancy anxiety. This fueled his insecurities. He's always been upfront about not seeing himself as conventionally attractive, and no matter how much I try to reassure him, the guilt seems to linger. It's particularly tough when I try to compliment his looks, feeling like he questions my sincerity, and it breaks my heart.

I don‘t think his glasses suit him - they‘re too big and leave irritation marks on his face. And his fashion sense isn‘t rlly my style, but I’d never pressure him to change. However, I can’t shake the feeling that he’s not fully embracing his potential. His bare face (without the glasses) is beautiful to me. But I’m committed to never being controlling or dictating his wardrobe choices. That’s a line I would never cross.

I’m conventionally attractive, but I also do put more effort into my appearance than he does. I even had to cut out some toxic friends who deemed me too good-looking for him.

Despite everything, I truly believe that love goes beyond physical appearance. As we age, looks fade, but the beauty of what’s within remains. Our bond is what matters most. Yet, it’s difficult knowing he sees me as the most beautiful person in the world, while I struggle with these mixed feelings.

**TL;DR:** I love my boyfriend deeply but struggle with guilt because I don't find him physically attractive. Recent challenges, like an abortion and resulting intimacy issues, have intensified his insecurities. While I'd never pressure him to change, I feel he's not fully embracing his potential.

This is my first relationship and I do really love him and see myself with him in the future but I don't know man few things really upset me. It could be that I am too sensitive and if that's the case, please give constructive criticism, if I need to change I will. 


Here are few things that genuinely made me upset. 

1) him liking posts of half naked women. 

Before we started dating, I was very vocal about the fact I don't want him watching porn and like inappropriate pictures of other women on social media. I explained him in detail my view on this specific thing and also that it will make me insecure (I have grown up in a pretty toxic household and have had few experiences that have ruined my self esteem). 
 
Literally the day after we started dating he liked a very inappropriate post. He apologized, we moved on. It happened again. I said I am breaking up, he begged it will not happen the third time and it hasn't happened. 

2) he took someone else's name 

We were sexting, things escalated, I asked him something along the lines of ""have ya ever gotten erect to someone"" And he took some random girl's name. It kinda fucked me up, this could be my fault, since I am insecure, I have started feeling like I'm not hot enough for him and he couldn't take my name, but then again I do feel that, keeping the conversation in mind he should've understood. 

3) he doesn't reply to the things I send him. 

He just doesn't reply to a lot of things I send me, ke keeps saying something or the other keeps happening and then he forgets, this has happened in the past too and I have communicated that it upsets me when he doesn't reply to the things I send for days, but this is a pattern I'm noticing, he'll say sorry reassure me and then after a few weeks it will happen again. 

4) expects me to do things for him that he doesn't do for me

Something as simple and small as sending good morning texts, letting each other know when we're going to be busy etc etc. 


I was extremely vocal about all my insecurites and triggers before we stared dating, I believe in communication and well he deserves to know considering we're going to be dating. I do love him but these few things along with other smalls things are kinda adding up and I feel like I'm losing intrest but then at the same time I cannot imagine my life any other way.

Former_Quail89672,I envy my high school friends and wish I could have their lives.,1,1c6etsy,0,"I (21M) am someone who really should have every reason to be happy. I come from a middle-class background. I'm studying law at one of the best schools in my country. I have never truly experienced any difficulties in life apart from my parents going through a divorce.

I should be happy. I should be satisfied. But for some reason I just keep craving the one thing I simply can't get. I just spend my days feeling completely fucking useless and like I have no purpose. The only times I forget about this sense of worthlessness is when I am distracted by school, at the gym or social interaction with people. The latter is really the only one that is fulfilling long term, but I don't know how to get it.

I keep looking at my friends from high shcool and I just want to be in their shoes. They all went into engineering and they all seem to have life figured the fuck out. They had tons of friends within weeks. Have managed to hold onto said friends and get invited to more parties and social events than they could ever hope to attend. Meanwhile the only way I get to attend anything is if my one friend from high school that happens to go to my university invites me, but I can't join very often because I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb as a law student in the middle of his engineering peers.

Basically I long for the attention my friends get. I really struggle to connect with ANYONE in university. I try my hardest to get to know literally anyone. I talk to every single person that talks to me and I put as much effort as I possibly can into being an appealing person. I'm trying my best to dress well, I try to balance being laid back with being friendly and easy going. I try to make an effort to make myself available. I do anything anyone asks of me. I try to ask questions and to get to know people. Despite all this no one seems to want to really hang out with me, and on the off-chance that someone does, they seem to fade away very quickly despite me putting in crazy effort to be a good friend.

How and why I struggle while my friends don't is a mystery to me. At work I connected with people. I still get invited to company parties by my former colleagues. At my workplace from before uni I also had a super easy time socially, and the same was true in high school. Something changed when I started university and it's killing me. It also isn't that I'm unattractive or something. Whenever I do get into a social setting I tend to perform well and I have zero issue talking to people or attracting women. Seeing my friends from HS do so well only worsens it because I feel like if they are able to succeed, so should I, but I just can't. I'm terrified I'll push even them away eventually if my loneliness starts presenting itself as jealousy. I mean I'm happy for them and the only reason I feel like this is because I want the same thing, not because I want to take anything away from them or drag them down.

I just don't know how to approach these issues because it feels like I'm not even doing anything wrong. Yes I'm a bit socially anxious, but that hasn't stopped me previously. I feel like I should be succeeding but I just keep on failing socially and it's making me ever more desperate. I simply can't put my finger on what the issue is, and it feels like the more I fail the worse it gets.

destitutioner,My (24) partner (25) got hit on by a friend and i’m raging,0,1c6eqvx,2,"My partner Ro and I are very much in love to a point where it’s sickening. People often assume we are engaged or have been together for less then a few months, but we are coming up on four years. I’ve had issues with a friends friend Hailey (26) previously that stem from their lack of social awareness and unintentional cruelty. They have autism/adhd and have been extremely rude several times in group settings to me (telling me I need to go on meds, for one). Nonetheless Hailey really likes hanging out with is and invites themself along to a lot of club nights, parties, etc and our mutual friend Eric is extremely people pleasing and lets Hailey do whatever they want. I’m never thrilled to see Hailey, but in a group setting its whatever. 

Long story short, Hailey is going through a nasty breakup and apparently has a huge crush on Ro. Let me just be clear, Ro and I are also decently attractive and Hailey is…challenged in that area. Different strokes for different folks of course, but Ro and I are hit on quite a bit, both separately and together. It doesn’t bother us, and honestly it keeps things interesting. But Hailey came to my house to pregame and was crying over their ex and also making zero effort to talk to anybody but Ro. I kept an eye out as we went to the club, and Hailey became bolder as they got drunker. When I mentioned this to Eric a few days later, I was less mad because I thought that it was a drunken misstep. Sometimes alcohol lets you a little too loose around attractive people, ya know? I’ve overdone liquid courage myself. But apparently Hailey had been talking to Eric about their crush for ages, and Eric was horrified by Hailey’s behavior. 

I am really horrified by how angry I feel at Hailey. I an having pretty horrible thoughts and I am disgusted that they would even presume that they had a chance with Ro. Ro is only in the group because they are my partner, as well. There is no previous connection or friendship there. Not to mention I was right in front of Hailey as they made an absolute fool of themself over and over. Hailey disgusts me and I want to tell them so. They are ugly inside and thats reflected on the outside, too. I don’t need advice or criticism, I’m just venting because I am so unbelievably angry that Hailey thought that I could just be disregarded like that by Ro, and the audacity to do that right in front of me.

ThrowRALosing5Years,Just need to get this off my chest,1,1c6eo39,0,"Going through some emotional times with my (24M) partner (26F). Thinking about it, she'd kill me if I said 27 haha. I am just so broken up right now and don't really have anyone in the loop to talk to. We have been together for 5 years but in perspective that's a fifth of my life and pretty much all my adult life. 

She is struggling right now mental health wise and I don't know whether she wants to try continue the relationship or not. She's been with her family and friends for the past couple weeks. 

I have been just an awful person in the last months to most people around me, including her. I am now going to therapy for it to find the cause of these behaviours but me and my therapist think it comes down to stress management and unchecked insecurities. I stupidly gave her an ultimatum earlier this year for her to find work before September or I'd have to continue life without her; what a stupid thing to say. I just wanted her to have that purpose and make new friends. Having this perspective of maybe losing her makes me want to take all that back. I get paid well, I would want nothing more than to look after her as long as I get to stay with her and help her. I just want to tell her sorry so bad and hold her in my arms.

I can't sleep in our bed anymore. It's just so difficult looking across and seeing the place where she is normally so cute and beautiful sleeping.

She comes back in a few days from her home country to have a talk and I have so many questions but I don't know if I want the answers. I told her yesterday that I don't feel comfortable with her coming here and think she took that as I'm angry or upset with her. But I really am just scared of what she has to say and having to look at my love again and watch her leave. 

I'm just in so much shock. I just wish I could go back in time, treat her better, work on my issues sooner and help her out. I hope she gives me a chance and wants to stay but I also want her to get better and be happy.

Ive had breakups before and managed to get back on the horse and come out better. This time feels different. I don't think I want anyone else. I wanted to propose to her this year. She is my sunflower.

I thought we were so compatible, both don't want kids, listen to the same music (I even wanted to start going to more events with her which I rejected hard before and wish I didn't), we make each other laugh, we love the same foods, we love the same type of affection. I could go on and on. 

It's not just some girl I've been dating I could be losing, it's my best friend and the woman I wanted so bad to spend the rest of my life with. 

If there are readers, I know that it seems so soppy and maybe even icky but I can't help how I feel and just need to get it off my chest.

OkReading8247,I think I’m in love with my ex,1,1c6enlg,0,"This is going to be long so if you make it to the end, I appreciate you. 

My ex and I had a kid when we were teenagers. His parents/family had moved out of state (back to where they are from) but he decided to stay bc we were young and in love. I found out a couple months later that I was pregnant. We tried to make it work but he wanted to raise our kid where he was from and I struggled being away from my family and so did he. (we both moved back and forth several times) I broke up with him bc I was tired of it. He would move back and want us to come with him but I wanted some consistency. 

I struggled for a long time being a young mom. I threatened him a lot when he would come back bc I was scared he would take our child, etc. He started staying away for longer periods. We were free spirits and loved music (he plays guitar) and I always loved the time we would spend together but I just thought it wasn’t realistic to raise our child together. I thought I was doing the right thing. I felt like I couldn’t be a free spirit and raise my child, like I had to put that aside and be more mature. 

Fast forward a couple years and I meet my now husband. Our relationship was chaotic as well but financially he supported us so I stuck around. At this point I was still angry with my ex because I always thought we would be together. Anyway, I get pregnant by my now husband and we get married. Shortly after getting married I find out he is cheating on me. I felt stuck bc I was pregnant and my kid was already calling him dad, etc. So I stay because I feel stuck. 

Fast forward a few more years and my sister is in the hospital really sick. I find out again my husband is cheating on me. While I’m at the hospital every day he’s on tinder talking to other women. I forgive him again because once again, I can’t deal with it. My sister was dying in the hospital. Anyway long story short I’ve caught my husband on tinder several times. He even gave a woman his number and was planning to meet up with her but she fell asleep! 

Fast forward several years and I’m gaining some confidence as a woman and really struggling. Depending on the day it seems like I can’t decide what I want to do. One day I want a divorce, one day I want to be independent and be on my own, and the next day I find myself wanting to reconnect with my ex. 

I find myself wishing I never broke up with him and just did what I needed to do to make it work. Ugh. I have been honest with my husband on how I feel but he begs me to stay with him and make it work. I don’t know if he truly feels this way or he just doesn’t want to deal with a divorce. Long story short, I’m struggling.

alanna_fae,I (19F) can't move out without financial help and neither can my mom and sibling,1,1c6ebaz,0,"I'm currently in college with my older silbing (21) and we both live with our parents. Our dad has always been a cheating, abusing, lying piece of shit. Physically abusive, verbally abusive, financially abusive, and extremely controlling. My mom became a stay-at-home-mom (at my father's request) when my sibling was born and has remained without a career for the most part, only having worked at a daycare until I was around seven I think. She has her associate's degree and so does my sibling. 
My parents have known each other and been together since my mom was 16 and my dad was 21. My dad grew up in an extremely abusive household, so it was easy for my dad to get empathy/sympathy from my mom whenever he would do something fucked up. He turned to drugs and abused/sold them a lot, and my mom got roped into that world. He used to beat the shit out of her on an almost daily basis back then--she tried to leave him once and said all her goodbyes as an 18 year old with her neck and face covered in bruises. He drove to her brother's house as that's where she had fled to, got her back with promises that he would change and they'd get out of that shitty ass town, and they've been together since. 
Throughout my childhood, there would be good periods and bad periods. My dad would drink a specific type of alcohol even though it would make him aggressive, and during the years where he was constantly drinking those two types of alcohol, he was constantly ""play fighting"" with me and my sibling. Always being way too rough, leaving bruises, and it was just not fun at all to have a 180 pound man trying to fight you as a kid. His excuse was always that he was just playing and we were too sensitive, but I'm pretty sure this was just abuse. We would beg him to stop but he never listened. It was always kind of ""well, I can't stop this from happening so I might as well just sit here and cry until he gets bored."" He could also be malicious and not just stupid and drunk, though. I don't remember this very much, but when we were kids, my sibling used to grab me and sometimes get my mom and a bunch of food from the pantry and we would push the dresser, nightstand, and whatever else in front of the door to barricade it so that our dad couldn't get in and spend the whole weekend hoping we were safe in their room. My sibling remembers one night him pounding on the door and yelling ""you think you're safe just because the kids are in there with you???"" To my mom. We had to hide in my sibling's room and barricade their door almost every weekend until I was around fourteen I think (this is very foggy for me). 
During this time, my mom fell into alcohol. They had stopped with the drugs by the time my mom was pregnant for the first time, but when her dad died when I was 8 (I think) she kind of lost it. Her husband was cheating on her, both of her parents were dead, her older brother was no help anymore as he was dealing with drug addiction at this point, and her younger sister was also in an abusive relationship and not in a place to help in any kind of way. She did her best to be a good mom and she was never abusive to us, but she needed help and no one was willing to help her, so my sibling and I had a somewhat strained relationship with her in our preteen/teen years as a result of some of the decisions she was forced to make alone.
My mom is now 43 and my dad is 47. He makes a lot of money in some cushy super overpaid job and my mom overheard him on the phone telling people that he is going to divorce her sometime between now and the end of April. This is fantastic news to me and my sibling; we would love nothing more than to be able to get the fuck away from him. My mom is convinced that my dad will find some way to screw her out of alimony, that my sibling and I will go off with my dad, and that she'll be sad and alone forever. I love my mom more than anything and both her and my sibling mean the world to me. I truly don't feel like I have a life worth living without my mom. I'm not sure what to do because my mom doesn't believe that my sibling and I will support her and help with alimony if we can and continue living with her, even though that is exactly what we want and are planning to do. My dad is also very wishy-washy with this whole divorce ordeal, so it could really be any time between now and August. I don't know how to continue living in this torture and I don't know how to convince my mom to believe us. To be fair to my dad, although he has continued cheating and lying and withholding finances/money from my mom, he has not been physically abusive in months and hasn't been that much of an asshole, so my sibling and mom don't see why I want to get out of here so bad and so quickly. My dad travels a lot and I have tried to convince my mom to leave him numerous times while he was away on trips, but she just cannot do it. I wish I could get her to understand that everything will be okay and she will not be alone.",1713371350.0,
Apprehensive-Yam5048,Should I give up on him? ,1,1c6e9vm,0,"Hi!
I have a crush on someone from work. He’s from Manila and Im not. I live pretty far from Manila, so I don’t get to report to the office as often as he does. So, I never told anyone from work that I like him, especially that he’s pretty close to my other workmate who is a girl.

When I went to Manila last year, I caught him one time looking at me and we had an eye to eye contact for more than a second. I didn’t mind that. Then when I got home from Manila, I checked pictures and videos from that day and I noticed he kept on looking at that girl. So yeah, I accepted the possibility that he seriously likes the girl. Then the girl hangs out with him now. I didn’t asked for the details since I know it will hurt and started not giving a care on them.

When this year came, I did not mind him anymore. Of course, I still talk to him but I just saw him as just a workmate. I still liked him but he somehow became someone unreachable. So he became a happy crush, still no one from work knows about it. I went back to working in Manila. But this time, I am okay with me not having a chance on him. 

Then, I was shock because that girl kept on teasing me and him. Im not really sure but the girl kept on asking me questions and pushing me towards him. I didn’t like it because it felt that Im being used. I know they have connection because they chat with each other outside work and they hang out. The guy never likes any of my photo in a socmed where we mutually follow each other but he reacts/likes her photo. When she asks me things, I always tried to change the subject to the point that it made me awkward. I hated it. The next day, i noticed him looking at me again for a few times but I dont get it anymore. It made me more confused if I should give up on him or not.

Then when I went back home, I open my other socmed account and he added me there. But his chats were as always—just work tone. But the girl always tells me that I should give him a chance. Funny, cause he never chats or even talks to me outside of work.

Should I give up on him?",1713371256.0,

Hey John this is Jade (I hate it but i miss you)

I don’t know if I ever crossed you mind or if u ever think i was just a one time fun. I hate to admit it but im sad that what happened between us was just gone instantly. Me in myself within felt that i had a connection with you. You made me felt like you cared for me (idk if im just delusional) you made an impact in my life. I gave up things to prove that i wanna get this serious. I don’t know is it the same with you? Maybe our destiny is written on a dying star that exploded before we were able to get to read the good part. I really am worried for you rn. I removed you because it hurts to see that you’re not there even if you’re there. Yes i admit the time is brief yet idk why but i felt u. Id do crazy thinking of u the whole day waiting for u. I am so worried cause i have read some letters, i dont knownif its yours but i read some letters about struggles and i think i can see you talking about that to me soon if we would have made it. I have been just the calm and sweet person cause i can hear in your voice that you’re having some heartaches that you carry. I don’t wanna add up to that. I don’t hate you. I might have said words that i don’t wanna say out of frustration. If you don’t want to talk to me i understand that and I hope this someone who hunts me down will find their peace and accept that I am not into their game. If i hurt you im sorry and i hope you will not freeze your heart. Go out and enjoy life babe. I will be no longer in your life but you are in mine. The space for you will always be here. Its gonna be filled with cobwebs and dust but don’t worry its yours and no one can take it. I love you and goodbye.

I hope that i can take you for a walk in the lake or the wharf someday as a way to say sorry and im letting you go but in my mind you were part of me. I hate to be back to my own doings but its a way to distract myself and its not on my main account now. Im sorry and i have loved you genuinely.

gb_2888,Just think I know silly things too much,1,1c6e3d2,0,"It's funny. My friend think I should work as a detective. I somehow think so too. 

I liked one actor. I read old tweets about him, I followed his friends' IGs. But then something just connected. I found out he had a relationship with another actress who had nothing to do with him in the same company. Lol if people found out, his fame would be ruined because he just got popular. Of course I kept my mouth shut. I used to have a hunch like that with another singer. He later publicly confirmed the relationship that I suspected lol.

My friend told me that the other friend had a new boyfriend. I was like uh huh. Then I asked her if she wanted to know who. I somehow think I could find him. She giggled and told me to try. I checked her IG's likes but didn't see anyone who was potentially be her new bf. So I checked the followers, she had like 300. I swiped through then somehow had a hunch on one guy that later I realized I was right. That was him. He didn't like any of her pictures or commented. The profile had nothing on it but his picture from afar. My friend told me dang, I could really be a detective lol.

I then met a guy. The relationship was short because I didn't trust him. But I still fixated on him. I just kept browsing occasionally. I learned that his dad either had a mistress or an illegitimate daughter because on one paper online, her name was on top of the list, before his own wife, son, and daughters. It's not his dad's mother because I checked on social media, the picture I had was from a young girl. The picture didn't show her face though so it's just way more sketchy. One of her friends was his dad. I was not sure if that's his dad's profile because it had his name on it but the profile picture was a baby angel (lol). And he didn't friend with other family members. I think the guy didn't know about this because he openly hated his dad but didn't mention about this. When I learned about this, I was like, dang, I dug too much. I needed to stop. So I stopped because it did take lots of my brain power to connect things. But if it's true, it's kinda sad. I saw his mom followed positive pages. Maybe as a way to be sane amid the toxicity (according to him, his dad was kind of abusive). And his younger sister tried to connect them. It'd be sh*tty if things I found out were true. Of course it wouldn't be an excuse for how sh*tty he treated me. His BS was his own thing.",1713370832.0,
mycatsonthemoon,My ex is having a baby & all I can do is laugh,0,1c6dxxn,0," I found out from a friend that my ex is having a baby and all I can think is; I’m so glad I left him for good because I could never imagine having to deal with him for the rest of my life. Also, I’m praying for this girl. She has no idea who he really is. Sometimes I wish I had more balls to warn the women he’s dated, but they all eventually learn for themselves anyways. This guy is a textbook narcissist. I hate him and wouldn’t even touch him with a 10ft pole now. He scarred me for life and left me absolutely heartbroken and traumatized all at the same time. We began dating in high school but were on & off for years. At first, everything was sunshine & rainbows. He was super popular, while I was more shy and reserved. Being with him felt like a rush. We’d always hang out with his friends and I felt like I was on top of the world. But…as you can guess, those warm fuzzy feelings wore off eventually. He began to show me his true colors little by little, but I was so young and naive. I didn’t even know what a narcissist was, and believed that I would never find anyone better than him..so I stayed, until he’d break up with me, and then when he came crawling back, I’d take him back like clockwork. It was super toxic. He’d make me delete all of my guy friends out of my phone and I could no longer speak to anyone of the opposite sex. He would get pissed at me if I wanted to hang out with any of my girl friends, even family. Eventually he isolated me to just him and his circle of friends. I lost my virginity to him, but only because he begged me for months and months to finally give in. Now that I look back, I don’t think I took his virginity like he made me believe. Anyways, he was seriously deranged in the head. He’d tell me that if I didn’t “put out”, he’d find relief elsewhere and that it would be MY fault. He’d regularly cheat on me. If I had to guess, it’d be with about 50 girls at least. Not joking. One time I found his burner phone, and it was filled with sooo many girls’ nudes. Most of those girls were his “friends”. Oh yeah, he was allowed to have friends of the opposite sex, but I wasn’t. Every time we broke up he would lie on social media, calling me every name in the book, and how I cheated on him (which literally never was true, I’ve never cheated). He’d turn the world against me and I had no one because he made me cut everyone off. One time I found out he was sharing my nudes with his friends, and I only ever sent him pictures like that because he’d beg and threaten to cheat on me if I didn’t. He really made my life hell and it was hard for a while to date anyone else. I felt like everything I did was wrong and didn’t know the difference between a healthy relationship and a toxic one. Every girl he’s dated after me has been cheated on by him. He’s a serial cheater with issues that should be studied in a lab. Now that he’s with this new girl, who he’s barely been dating a few months, I can only pray for her. I fear that she’s gonna get it the worse because they’re having a kid together. He most likely is still a narcissistic asshole/serial cheater, and with a kid involved I can only imagine the disaster that’s about to unfold. I do feel bad for this girl, but it’s laughable that my ex is about to have a child. I couldn’t imagine a worse person to be raising a child. In the end, I’m doing so much better than him in life & have a great relationship with myself. I trust myself and know my worth, and surround myself with people who would do anything to make me smile. My life has never been better, and I can’t fathom how I was able to go through all of that by myself. It definitely shaped me into who I am today, and I learned a lot about what NOT to allow in a relationship. I’m grateful to have escaped that “relationship” when I did. ",1713370486.0,

We're quite well off so while she would hire maids and babysitters, she would go to bars and restaurants alone, with friends or with my dad. She used to take my older brother to bars when he was 2-3 which i thought was hella weird ngl. My parents even let us take sips of their beers when we were younger. My mom used to get mad at me when I was younger because I didn't know how to do certain things like dining etiquette, but she had never really taught me how to.

Long read sorry ,1,1c6drs3,0,"I am a 31F with 2 kids (single mom long story but a permanent no contact order with my ex). I am ending a relationship of 14 months that has been so amazing in so many ways but every time I go to ask for advice on how to salvage it I delete it because I logically know I have to walk away. We get along so well, my kids (only have known him a couple months) adore him, we’re best friend “vibes” (don’t shoot I just couldn’t think of a better word and obviously a best friend wouldn’t betray me over and over so I can’t say he’s actually my best friend), the sex is incredible, he cooks, he cleans (we don’t even live together), he helps fix things unprompted, he is calm and patient, we don’t scream and yell etc. I can totally be myself around him my friends love him, my family loves him. It’s really hard to reconcile that the same man is repeatedly cheating (sexting and stuff so not physical but that doesn’t matter logically) he’s gotten caught on several apps/accounts several times, he has lied about it even when I show him it’s like pulling teeth for him to disclose and admit, but then he owns it and blah blah. Well recently I told him maybe he needs therapy and he states no he has a handle on it (obviously not if you continue to do it). I have no way of knowing if he has physically cheated (I have been tested because regardless of whether I’m in a committed relationship my priority is my health) but I can’t believe him anymore when he says he will never do it again or that he’s never physically cheated etc. also his family is heavily religious (recently learned as he did not tell me I had to figure it out) and strict so that was his excuse for not meeting his family. Come to find out they may not even know I exist let alone that I have 2 kids. He also just finally disclosed when I asked over and over that he is going back to being a JW like his family and how he was raised. Honestly after the life he’s lived and saying he wants to continue our relationship but he’s going in full fledged again meaning no holidays birthdays etc (which he celebrated happily the past year) but obviously doesn’t stop having sex or staying at my house 3-4 nights a week. I’d have to accept that and do holidays alone with my kids birthdays alone etc he’d be gone several nights a week and constantly being told to leave me as I’m a “non believer” it’s just a fucked up mess. I won’t convert and I don’t even think he believes in it but it’s easier to convince me than it is to lose his whole family if he lives the life he wants and tells them the truth but he says that’s not it. Anyways I just need reassurance that I’ll find all the good in another person at some point in my life and that I could happily get married and I could have a child with a good man who loves and respects me and is my best friend and we can have all of the stuff I loved about our relationship. I just feel like I’m getting older and I spent my whole life abused either sexually emotionally physically or a combo and I felt really safe and good until all this happened. I feel like I’ll never get a happy healthy relationship and my little girl inside will never get the wedding or the happy pregnancy (I was abused during my pregnancies the last pregnancy me and baby almost died from a hemorrhage due to abuse). I see a therapist I have for a long time long before him for all the other stuff in my life. I just need happy stories and reassurance. I haven’t been able to talk to my loved ones about this.

I'm looking for advice on how to move passed such a small joke and honestly get it off my chest (pun intended). We've been together for 3 years. He's really into fitness, is muscular, and therefore his chest muscles are kind of large. I'm a 38B, honestly closer to an A at this point given the gapping in the cups of my bra after going from 200 to 160 lbs. I'm not a petite girl either, my frame is pretty boxy with wide shoulders and I feel like my boobs do not match my frame.

I decided against it because I have an autoimmune disease and the implants would most likely make me sick. He knows this as I've talked about this insecurity with him as I noticed all his exes have had large boobs, but he's always reassured me he finds them just fine. 

So onto what was said...I was trying on a new shirt and although I ordered the largest size, I found I couldn't fit it with my bra on and the shirt had no stretch to it. So I took off my bra, showed him what it looked like and joked about me walking out in public like that (my nips were showing through). He said why not? He thought it looked nice. I gave him a skeptical look because I was surprised he would be ok with me showing that much in public. 
He asked if I thought it was ok if he was out in public without a shirt on? I didn't think it was a big deal as he has jogged without a shirt before and it was more acceptable for a guy to not wear a shirt out in public when compared to a woman.
He then said ""what's the big deal then? My boobs are bigger than yours anyways, so it's fine,"" and gave a big laugh. 
I got really quiet. I didn't see that joke coming and it just stabbed my heart. To hear him joke about a known insecurity hurt, especially as I value his opinion on my looks the most. I gave a weak smile and walked away into a room to take the shirt off and he followed me shortly after sensing I was upset. 
He got really sad and apologetic and I told him to stop making a fuss because I was trying to take his joke as a joke, but as he kept apologizing tears started falling and ... I cried like a wee baby. I'm ashamed. It wasn't loud crying but silent tears streaming down my face with sniffles. He apologized that he hurt my feelings and it wasn't his intention. I get it was just a light hearted jest, but I still can't stop fixating on it. It's driving me a bit mad. I feel like I don't even want to take my top off during sex or let him see me changing because I feel like I just look like a little flat chested boy and am comparing myself to his exes and the Instagram models he looks at. We talked again about it and he admitted, ""yes I like big boobs, but I like your boobs too.""
How do I get passed such a silly joke and just accept that this is what I have to work with and be fine with it? I don't want it to affect my relationship because I feel inadequate.

TLDR: Fiancé made a light hearted joke about his muscley chest being bigger than my boobs, feelings got hurt, insecurities have become inflamed, and I'm struggling getting passed it.",1713348589.0,
the_greatwave,my boyfriend wants us to live together,1,1c6dmbu,7,"so, i (23f) am a student. i have another 3 years of studying left after this year. my boyfriend (23m) and i are currently long distance as a result. we have been together for 8 months, however, we were previously together for 3 years between the ages of 17-20. however, he has decided to move to my university city and wants to live together. i was happy when he told me this plan, however, i told him i was not willing to move in with a man unless we were engaged or married.

he has now moved his job up here and is working remotely from his mum's and dad's house until we find a place. however, yesterday i reminded him that i was not comfortable moving in with him unless we were engaged or married.

he said that he would not consider marrying somebody unless he had lived with them first because his parents didn't cohabit and now they're very unhappy in their marriage. he would, however, propose to somebody before moving in with them.

i asked what the issue was then, and he said he didn't see himself being engaged this young and definitely not this side of the year.

i'm at a crossroads now. i do want to live with him, but i am not willing to budge on this boundary. i don't know if he's stalling because he's not sure about me or if he thinks he can do better. in my mind, i have a few options:
1. break up.
2. don't live with him and wait until he's ready to propose (however, i don't know if he'd propose because he loves me or if he wants to live with me).
3. live with him under the condition that he proposes before the end of 2024 and if he doesn't, move out and break up.

if anyone has been in a similar position, i would love to hear anecdotes and advice! :)",1713369733.0,
FriedTofu143,I am completely alone,1,1c6dki8,2,"This isn’t a “everyone always leaves me!” situation, its more of an unfortunate series of events.

I have social anxiety, so it’s tough for me to talk to people on my own. When you’re in elementary school, that doesn’t matter though, because no one has friends, and extroverts are willing to talk and integrate new people into their group. I had friends in elementary, and then we moved when I was 12 to a new place (dad was in the military so we had no choice)

In highschool it’s harder, because everyone already has their old friends, and just goes to highschool with them. I didn’t, so I just kind of sat and waited for someone to talk to me, as usual.

I got picked up by a few friend groups, I left the first one because I couldn’t keep up. Eventually I made more permanent ish friends, but they knew eachother since like kindergarten, so I always felt like an outsider. big Impostor syndrome

Im in college now, and we havent talked since our prom in June. They’re all in different colleges, and we all still have our numbers, but no one has said anything, and I cant tell if they’re talking without me, or if no one is talking to anyone. I was looking forward to college, because I wanted to make new friends that shared my interests (my highschool friends didn’t) but so far I’m just alone all the time

I know its my fault Im alone, since I could just talk to people. I also know its not my fault Im alone, because if we never moved I would have a strong friendgroup.

Im mostly just scared that any friend I make I’ll avoid, and if I join a preexisting group ill get impostor syndrome. Im scared that as we all get older and people know the friends they already have longer and longer, that ill always just be the third wheel that cant join in on references and that Ill just never be apart of the group

throwRa-221-xve,i can’t stop cheating and get a grip,1,1c6dhbp,1,"
i’m 21 and at this moment in my life i just look like a bum, a deadbeat.

i had a rough upbringing growing up, as many people do. my dad was a drug addict and my mom was a stay at home mom. i never got much emotional availability from them or affection, we never really went out as a family, got together with family or have any hobbies. we grew up very poor, and my parents toxic relationship had us moving constantly and always in an unstable household. because of all the moving i was never able to make great strong friendships and started to learn how to quickly detach from people and never make our relationship too deep to protect my feelings. 

i started dating at 15, and never stopped. it fills a void almost but it still isn’t enough for me. i cheated on my first boyfriend, and have been hopping from relationship to relationship since then. fast forward to me now being 21 and even worse. i always complain about how i can’t find a good man, and just switch boyfriends when im too unhappy. then i found an amazing guy, and i lost him because i couldn’t help myself from cheating. but i knew i didn’t deserve a man like him and sabotaged it. now im with the guy who i cheated on him with and just feel nothing and he treats me like nothing almost. but that’s what i wanted right? there’s no reason for me to be able to feel sad AT ALL because this was the consequences of my own actions. 

i’m addicted to marijuana, and it’s been getting worse and worse. if i don’t work or try to go to the gym i’ll just lay in bed and just rot all day.  i had to step away from school in general because i wasn’t focusing how i needed to and i want to be a nurse so i have to watch out for my grades. but i feel so BEHIND. im 21 and im barely doing my prerequisites for it and i just don’t even feel like im good enough for it. i feel eel like im driving myself into despair, self sabotaging my future, and just myself in general. 

how can i change myself? how can i make friends in a small town where i basically messed up my image? i don’t want to be this disgusting image of a woman, im so unhappy and i want to find my self worth, self respect, self love. to where i won’t be hurting myself and other people. i want to find hobbies and friends. i want to be okay being single, and one day be fit enough to carry a relationship.

AdIntrepid8247,Reflecting on a toxic friendship that came from an abusive family,1,1c6d2u0,0,"edit: I am terribly sorry for the mistakes english is not my main language  
  
When I was a teenager, I met a friend through social media who caused a lot of problems for a long time. She engaged in bullying, spread false rumors, and manipulated others extensively. It got to the point where it made me sick for years. I also want to mention that this is my own perception. She probably have her own version of the story, but it won't remove how much this situation got me sick.  
  
Today, as adults, we had never reconnected for years. My issue is that I ended up growing with a lot of remorse, and recently I decided to tell her how her actions in the past affected me. I also want to mention that I do not truly know her since we never met in person. In her response, she was extremely defensive, mocked me, and completely turned the situation against me, qualified me as the problematic and that I am playing the victim. Not to mention that '' everyone got over this situation that hapenned years ago except me ''. I was simply trying to tell her how her actions affected me. I was trying to express a feeling. She denied everything or doesn't want to believe it, also wishing me bad things.  
  
However, I would like you to consider what this person experienced in her youth. When we were teenagers, this person confided in me that she came from an abusive family. Her parents neglected, starved, and even beat her. She shared with me things like how she always had a lack of feeling, which might explain her lack of compassion and empathy. She told me she had been in therapy before, even tried medication, but it hadn't worked.  
  
As for myself, I have experienced abuse from my father, who is a narcissistic abuser and I was left with PTSD that lasted for years. Fortunately, the police intervened and I haven't seen him since I was 12 years old. As for my mother, I was privileged to receive all her support and love but she also over protected me.  
  
Unfortunately, my mother passed away from cancer when I was 19, and when I was going through grief, I was still in touch with this person. She told me things like my '' insecurities was ruining people's life '' and my grieving should not be a reason even if she tried to understand me, etc. There's were some types of gaslighting from her. I mentionned that what she did in the past still scared me. She also told me that she was aware that she had the ability to '' manipulate '' and '' destroy people's life\\reputation '' but she consider herself '' adult '' enough to not act this way anymore.  
  
This situation was enough to break me and constantly being in doubt with myself. The way she was adressing me, being passive-agressive and constantly being condescending. It happened 6 years ago, few months after my mother's death.  
  
Today, I am now in psychotherapy to learn how to get through all of this.  
  
I am deeply saddened by the lack of empathy from this person. However, I still want to understand and be aware that she had a very difficult past. Sometimes I wonder if, because she experienced things at such a deep level, she didn't see teenage quarrels as serious. I also know that she is studying to become a psychologist.  
  
I had hoped that maybe she could understand other's perceptions with time. I would also like to understand her's but I cannot excuse the harm.  
  
Has anyone experienced something similar? What are your reflexion on this situation?  
  
TL;DR: As a teenager, I met a friend online who caused me years of distress through bullying and manipulation. Despite hoping for change, confronting her about her actions as adults only led to defensiveness and denial. Reflecting on her troubled past and my own experiences of abuse, I seek understanding while navigating the pain and seeking therapy to heal.",1713368451.0,
Zestyclose_Ruin_3266,feeling confused and hurt,1,1c6d0sv,0,"preface: me and my gf have not had any issues for well over a year, this is sort of our biggest something that is making us feel apart. i love her very much and i know she loves me, we need to talk this through but i’m just feeling awful right now 

so me and my girlfriend (both 19F) dating for almost 2 years have been going through a rough time the past month, we’re both first year university students with different majors, so finals can be stressful and like in most relationships it’s hard to balance. mostly stressful on her since she left to go on a exchange to italy during exam week so she had to finish all her final assignments before she left. (she is still doing exams when she gets back too). i did put a little pressure on her to want to hang out before she leaves and she did open up to me and said that i was stressing her out more because of approaching due dates.

now she’s in italy for 3 weeks (longest we’ve been physically apart), the first week she was a little distant, but she’s busy and that’s alright with me. a few days a go she messaged me saying she needed space and time to herself and that she was feeling too stressed out, i was confused and thought this meant she wanted to break up, but she assured me that it wasn’t my fault and i didn’t do anything wrong, and that she still wants to be together, that i mean so much to her and she loves me.

i apologized for assuming the worst and she apologized for not being clear and i told her i was glad she expressed how she was feeling and that i want to make sure she’s happy more than anything. but i feel like it’s also costing me my own happiness at the same time. that was the last time she texted me. 

i am just confused, she has not seen any of my messages since then when i see she is online (whatsapp) but looks at my instagram stories, she’s halfway across the world right now (we live in canada) and i hardly text her, am i not already giving her space? does space mean i’m completely shut out of her life right now? i can’t sleep and i can’t eat just wondering what is going on. i’ve been crying for what feels like days (in the middle of exams too).i guess i am hurt that i miss her so much and she feels so distant. we’re going to have a talk when she gets back. i just feel like if she wants to be so distanced from me, how could it not be my fault? she never told me what space means to her and i’m feeling so in the dark about what’s going on in her life right now. i just want her to be ok and for us to be ok. i’m really confused and i just want things to smooth out and for us both to feel better

dinks53,My GF broke up with me because her parents refused to meet me ,1,1c6czis,6,"My (M26/F26) as of 3 weeks ago ex) had a beautiful, easy, loving relationship. Never raised our voices at each other, constant compliments and legitimately passionate love. I thought she was the one. We had the same friends and I no one in the world could even compare. And I truly believe she thinks/thought the same way about me. 

My family adored her. My parents took her out to dinners alone (without me) and she met my entire extended family. However, her family did not reciprocate to me. I met her dad for about 20 minutes one time when we started dating and he didn’t ask me any questions or make any effort to talk to me. After that interaction, he refused to acknowledge my existence to his daughter, my GF. Her mom apparently disapproved and would not include me in any plans when she would come visit her daughter in our city. I always thought it was strange. 

Over time it got worse and worse with her parents trying to set her up with other people while we were still together. Her mom didn’t appreciate or acknowledge the ways I went out of my way to put their daughter as the main priority in my life or appreciate any of the nice gifts and gestures I made. 

The mother and my ex got into a fight about me the night before where the mom embarrassed my ex in front of all her friends after one of my exs friends asked the mom a question about me. They fought until 430 am and then my ex gf just felt tired of the situation. Tired of living a double life and tired of her parents disapproving of me. It came out after that her parents have always been this controlling way to her. 

And if you’re wondering why they judged me and thought so little of me, they just judged me from social media. They didn’t think I was “funny” (?) and wouldn’t allow their daughter to love who she wants. 

TLDR; ex gf broke up with me because her parents judged me beforehand from social media and refused to acknowledge my existence or our loving and beautiful relationship.

My sex drive is fairly high, I feel, but more than that I just need physical shows of affection most of the time. It helps keep me regulated and just feeling okay, but I'm tired of it. My wife (26f) has a lower sex drive than me and is also much less touchy. She does her best to meet my needs and give me back rubs and whatnot when I ask for it, and I appreciate it greatly. 

But it always seems to me like it's so inconvenient for her and I hate needing it. Last night, I crossed a line. She had said earlier in the day that she wasn't in the mood for sex and I was fine with that. When we went to bed, I was a little touchy while cuddling, which is pretty normal. Playful scratches, teasing close to intimacies, that sort of thing. Nothing very overt. 

She had fallen asleep and I was still being handsy. We've talked before about it being okay to be woken up with intimacy and so I didn't really think much of it when she woke up and gave me access. 

Turns out she barely remembers it. I'm absolutely sick to my stomach over my actions and so disappointed with myself. She said it's okay and to just not do it again. She forgave me.

I know that she sometimes has her mental down phases and extremely strict parents but part of me feels like maybe I did something wrong or she found someone else.

Growing up I didn't feel like I was going to live past 20, I figured the drug use and abuse I was going through would kill me, it didn't. 


I've burned through half my life span and my priorities have changed. I've realized I want to be a mother and a wife, I was scared of being a terrible mother and partner for a long time. 


I didn't lose my virginity until I (naively) thought I'd found someone to start a life with. It wasn't for any religious reasons so I didn't wait until marriage I just waited until I found a partner that wanted the same things as I did. 


For a while I was doing great, I was happy and my mental issues weren't as bad, I had someone to care for and I was starting to go places and do things. I was starting a business and getting serious about making a way for us, moving in together ect.



Then it all came crashing down when he admitted to not being attracted to me, not wanting me for anything other than what I was providing, he gaslit me into believing that we never had a real conversation about being completely exclusive, he had been cheating on me with some guy he worked with. And then I got fired. 



My will to go forward kinda vanished after that, I have no real motivation to keep trying so I stopped. My depression got really fucking bad for a while.



Then I met my current partner, neither of us are all that motivated to go forward, I'm currently working an under the table job, and he does doordash, we both live with family and don't have many prospects. We have a lot of the same issues as I had with my ex. He only wants me for what I provide for him and he has told me I'm more than one occasion he's not attracted to me. 


So We have been having issues and while he said he wanted to marry me in the beginning of the relationship I don't think he feels that way anymore, even if he did he doesn't have his shit together enough to get engaged, even if we've agreed to have a 1-3 year engagement.



I don't want to waste what good years I have on something that will never happen. 

We talked about marriage today, I asked how long he would like to wait, or what circumstances would be needed to get engaged, he couldn't give me an answer.

Yellowshirtbrowntie,[Update] - Still Getting Mistaken For A Homeless Person,1,1c6c3br,0,"I hope I'm following the rules for doing an update.

I was super grateful for the input on the last one and I got some really good advice. Someone suggested I post a picture and ask if the way I look or dress was getting me mistaken for a salesman, homeless person, or sketchy criminal.

I found a random chat site and sent someone pictures of me in the two outfits I was wearing most recently when these things happened and I asked some friends for their opinion. I got some really good insight that seemed to make sense.

Here's what I found

The free drink tokens thing was a series of honest misunderstandings. A lot of the people outside of the beer festival didn't know it was happening, and also didn't know the tokens would get them free drinks. So to them, I looked like a random guy in a hoodie walking up to people and holding my hand out with a bunch of wooden tokens and asking if they want my drink tokens. I Probably weirded out some uninitiated people who happened to all be on the same street. I didn't think it through because I was focusing on what I thought was a good deed.

The left overs guy was just a dumb guy who jumped to a wrong conclusion based on misjudging the information he had. Not malicious just misinformed and nosey and maybe working on a little prejudice. A good deed gone wrong, I can relate...

Getting mistaken for a door to door salesman while going to a bar for lunch after a job interview actually was malicious and because of how I was dressed. I was wearing a suit walking into a pretty divey bar with a messenger bag and the bartender made the assumption. Then she doubled down and kicked me out because she was embarrassed.

The clothing store, the cross walk, the ID check at my office, getting kicked out of the restaurant on my birthday, the car door handle accusations, and the ""I don't have cash"" girl were tentatively put in a ""potential racism"" pile. I can't say for sure that they were racist but the stranger from the chat said that a lot of these issues are based on assumptions, some of them are assuming things about who I am, what I do, or what I want, because of my race...not my clothes or hygiene...especially because I tend to run into people who are experiencing things outside their community for the first time (Tourists, college freshman, older people from the insular surrounding towns). She said that if I'm accused of a crime that didn't happen, I should ask myself if the person accusing me, or people who look like me. Also, I worked at that clothing store for 8 months and saw them do some stuff that felt pretty racist to some pretty normal customers and also leave some super sketchy customers alone.

A few of my friends and a coworker agreed that the way I describe the place I live in now and the areas where I had these issues in the other state sound really similar. They pointed out that when I go to the city or on my annual trip back to the other state where my friends are, there are a lot fewer of these issues. So it could be the area.",1713366066.0,
pancakewednesdays,Not doing well,1,1c6c13c,0,"I don’t know how else to prove to people that I am unwell. I’ve been feeling mentally unwell for a while now, the current low having been triggered by the loss of a close friend who took his own life, on top of a few different things that might seem unimportant to people but have deeply effected me as a person.

If anyone asks me, I will tell them I am unwell. I am depressed. I’ve experienced loss and trauma. I don’t think the people around me really understand the weight of this on me.

I am in therapy, and have been for a long time.

It’s the people close to me that disappoint me the most. I am being as judgmental as I possibly can be since this is an anonymous platform, and I am venting. I am terrible at asking for help and showing my bruises to people, but I honestly do not know what other way I can proclaim my cry of help other than saying “I’m not doing well. I’m struggling.”

I’ve just had a major breakdown in front of my family, triggered by something not that important. All I can think of now is if that they think I’ve “made a mountain out of nothing, again” because they cannot fathom the fact that my breakdown is very little to do with this trigger and everything to do with all the other things. And they know all of it. Because I tell them.

more_ti,Crossdressing husband ,1,1c6bqrb,3,"I'm in a polygamous marriage with two kids, and I love my husband, but I'm losing myself.He's a crossdresser who's also bisexual. At the beginning of our relationship, he confessed everything to me, and I was very accepting. That part of him is his Achilles' heel.At the start of our marriage, he created a profile on a dating site as a man in women's clothing, arranging meetings with other men. I discovered it and wanted a divorce. With a lot of psychotherapy, we managed to overcome it. We both went to therapy, at my insistence, and eventually found peace and contentment. He left that behind, and we didn't talk about it for a long time. We started experimenting with swinging, where he strictly adhered to the role of husband.Little by little, that part of him with the dressing returned to our relationship, and we started having joint encounters with bisexual men.As my life is generally very challenging, and I had a terrible childhood - both my parents suffer from mental illness, which has always worried me and consumed my time. To compensate for my concern and care for my parents, I provided my husband with as much support as possible.I accepted that he's happy when he's dressed up, and he always wants my involvement. He would never dress up outside of a sexual encounter with me. We started buying him clothes, the same ones I used to satisfy him. He shaved his whole body, and it got to the point where he kept his clothes in my closet and wore them every night under his regular clothes.His desire for me to penetrate him with a strap-on became our only sexual activity. It exhausted me, and he wanted me to fist him, which disgusted me, but I agreed to make him happy. In some way, I was buying his happiness, and after these events, he would be wonderful to me. 

I’m increasingly desperate and slowly losing myself, but at the same time, I realize I’ll never have a husband.

Our children and friends know nothing about his/ ours life. His constant desire to be in a cage, to constantly dress up, put on makeup, and primp, exhausts me. He wants to talk about all of it every day, and it bothers me. No matter how much I explain to him that something needs to change, nothing happens. With each major argument, his feminine side takes up more space in our marriage.

All of it tired me out, and we ended up in therapy again, but this time it didn't work as well for us because we fell back into old habits.He needed more and more sex, and I began to be repelled by it. I couldn't stand seeing him tight in corsets and not seeing his masculine body anymore. I was even a little jealous because he always looked tidy in bed, while I wore an old T-shirt. Everything about it made me feel inadequate.As his desire for sex grew, even though he's nearing his fifties and my desire decreased, I encouraged him to meet other men alone just because I wasn't enough for him anymore.The last encounter was the last straw; I let him hang out with a couple while I was away. I found out he did things with them we hadn't discussed or agreed upon. Unfortunately, he crossed the line, and when I told him I was upset, he had nothing to say, no apologies. The conversation ended badly. He justifies to me that he needs it because his life is stressful, citing how I don't contribute financially like he does, so he needs it to feel better, that he works a lot, and it helps him cope with everything.

I'm very sad. 😢",1713365186.0,
sirmoneyshot06,Divorcing my wife ,0,1c6bqj7,3,"She isn't a bad person. She isn't even a bad partner. I'm just not happy with my wife and haven't been for a long time. It's easy for me to fake it and act like everything is alright but on the inside in longing for something that makes me feel complete. Everyone is telling me I'm making the wrong choice and I should think about the kids and how it will affect them. My view is how can I be the best dad possible if in not even happy myself. 

The wife is taking it hard because everyone in her life has always left her. Parents, friends, and now her husband. I want what's best for her and I still care for her as a friend and as the mother to my child. We both agreed when it comes to decisions we want what's best for the children. 

I simply just don't get fulfillment from the relationship like I use to. I don't feel a connection with her like I use to. This isnt something new and I should have noticed it sooner. I thought it was just a feeling and it would go away but it always came back stronger. 

I know I should feel worst then I do but deep down I honestly feel a sense of relief. I worry about my child and how it will affect them but I need to be happy as well. I can't keep faking it just to please everyone else. 

An I selfish for this? Do my feelings as a dad and husband not matter? Should I give our relationship a 4th try. 3 times this has happened before were I feel it's better off to leave. Each time we try again   but it never changes. That feeling always comes back one way or another. 

Maybe I'm looking for something that doesn't exist and I'm throwing away a perfectly fine woman, 3 kids, a 400k house, and a stable income. I'd throw it all way though, except the kids love my kids, just to be happy and feel something again.

I’m not ugly I feel like I’m decent enough but when I scroll through social media and see all these girls with these amazing bodies and pretty faces it just makes me feel like I’m not even worthy of being here. 

It gets so bad that sometimes I talk to my significant other and tell him he deserves someone prettier with a better body than me and legit ask him if he wants to break up so he could be with someone better. 

I even contemplate getting a boob job (32C), but I breast fed so they’re not as perky. The thought of a foreign object stuck in my body til I die makes me uncomfortable tbh.

Both_Performance_626,I want to leave my wife and child,1,1c6bnwn,3,"I (M24) am so tired of my wife and child. We were together since we were 18, been through crazy problems together. We never were happy and constantly argued (mainly I was upset over her cheating on me when we started seeing each other and I was upset over her high body count) but kind of kept quiet when we moved to another country. She decided that we should try for a child. Since he was born last year, she has been nothing but a headache to both of us. He constantly screams, required hospital care because he can't learn to swallow, which has improved. 

He screams rather than cries. He can't let us do work. And my wife yells at me for everything I do. There is no sexual intimacy anymore because of constant stress and her upset at me or something else. 

I have tried to keep working on it, and on this child. But since he's high maintenance, he only wants mom and I can't do anything. I cook for her and she doesn't eat it. I clean up the apartment and offer support, and all I get in return is nothing. Both have made me started looking elsewhere to leave because I cannot handle the household I am in with a 24/7 screaming child and a wife who yells at me if nothing goes her way. 

I can't voice out my opinions, I can't be myself. If I ask for a moment to play video games to relax, she allows it then yells at me after a few minutes. I am a naturally gestural person, I like to use my hands to talk. She hates it and yells at me to stand still like a soldier. If I ask her to do something or fix something about herself I don't like like leaving her hair in the shower, she gets mad at me. I am belittled to constantly being the bad person or the idiot. She even makes jokes calling me dumb and I repeatedly ask her to stop nicely, but she gets offended when I ask her to stop.

Fragrant-Wait-5447,Not invited to one of my best friends wedding. ,1,1c6bjv5,1,So someone who I still think as a great friend is getting married and I’ve been seeing posts lately that she is getting married. I saw the engagement post on Instagram and decided to text her congratulations. Me and her have been friends since my sophomore year of high school (8 years) and I was not invited to the wedding. I will say that we actually have not hung out in a while but we have texted little in between (for birthdays etc etc). Now I saw that the wedding was on May 25th via social media and I’m kind of hurt that I was not invited because I definitely would have invited her to my wedding if I was getting married because we had been through a lot together/ were great friends- even when we started college I would drive 3 hours to go see her and she would do the same. But I think joining the military hindered our friendship a bit and after that it was hard to stay in contact so we have not hung out since like 2022 but to me we have been through enough/ friends long enough to atleast get an invite because she is one of the first people I would think to invite to my wedding even though we may have drifted a bit. I don’t know maybe I’m crazy for thinking that but I just find it odd I’m not invited to a friend’s wedding who was once my best friend.. we were so close that I was like family at one point and I got very close to her family as well so I would have liked to attend her wedding at least.  ,1713364699.0,

I personally am in a bad place. I haven't feeling great emotionally, but my therapist has really helped me through this process. However, there's still one thing that troubles me: My memory.

I can't remember when (which annoys me), but I'm struggling to remember things. ""Did you talk with Maria today?"" I don't remember. ""Have you eaten?"" I don't remember. ""Do you have any homework?"" I don't remember.

I've always been annoyed by people that forget easily. Whenever I'm telling a story, and then someone says ""Oh, who was Ronny?"" When I told them 20 minutes ago, it annoys me, but I keep going. I know that's wrong. I know it's wrong when I scoff at my mother because she doesn't remember something I told her this morning.

It's all changed.

I'm only eighteen. I don't know what's going on with this memory loss. I can't remember anything, and it's scary. I got asked ""Hey, have you done that exam?"", and I remember I did. I remember writing my name, and struggling to answer the questions, yet I can't say yes, because I don't trust my memory anymore.

I don't even remember what I ate for breakfast this morning. It's nine o clock.

I'm really scared, because it's scary to forget, and I've been scared of forgetting things ever since a kid. It's my biggest fear, and it's happening. I feel unsure, I can't be confident when I say something, and it really feels off.

justathrowaway041724,I wish I could fix this,1,1c6ay8x,0,"Throw away for reasons. I just really want to get my emotions out. 

I (27m) do spicy content with my husband A (32m). A while back I met up with two other creators (let's call them O and C) to see if we would vibe for a video. While we were talking I found out C was a bit of a nerd just like me. We hit it off and while A was out of town we met up, we were being nerds, and we had fun together. I felt like we grew close very fast, I trusted him and he talked a lot about how we were friends now. 

I felt very comfortable including O and C into my life, I invited them over for game nights with other friends, we hung out separately, overall it was a fun time. The last thing I needed was for A to return and to meet them proper. It finally happened, weekly game night had come and we all decided to have dinner together before. I noticed A was having a few differences of opinions with O but I didn't feel like it was anything major, and while playing games later that night everyone had a grand time with laughter and happiness. 

Through the weekend I went out of town with A for a different job. While we were out we met with a creator from that city, took some pictures and posted together. I didn't really know the guy other than we all do the same kind of work. 

On Monday I received a text from O, showing that he had been blocked by that creator for no reason. He tells me that he wants to take a step back from me. At this point I'm devastated. I apologized, explained that I didn't really know him. O responds by telling me ""the company I keep is a major red flag"" and that he worries about what I've said about him to others. The thing is, I don't have any other friends in this space. I've never spoken to anyone about anybody other than my own personal friends about how much I liked O and C. I try to tell this to O but he doesn't respond.

All the while I'm talking to C. Panicked and confused I try to apologize but I don't really know what for. He tells me to stay calm, that he'll be here to help. And that while he doesn't know what O is going to do he's still my friend.  At around 6pm that night he stops responding to me. This guy since I met him tells me goodnight and good morning everyday and for the first time, he doesn't. The next day goes by, not a word from either of them.

I wanted to resolve this before telling A but clearly it wasn't getting better. I knew A would be resentful and I just didn't want that. Even now, I just want to know what I did wrong and what I could do to fix it. Friends are important to me, I don't often add friends to my circle. I lean on them and they lean on me. O and C, while we were talking, were great friends. I just don't understand what happened. Our theory is that they really didn't like A, but even then we never gossiped about them or did anything to intentionally hurt them. 

So now, I'm just sad. I opened my heart and I got burned. I'm hoping writing it out will help me move on. Strangely I would be happy to resolve this. They were buddies who I could talk anime and play video games with. My own friend circle loved them just as much as I did. But now I'm just left to wonder what I should have done. ",1713363212.0,

THundercroSS120,My Bestfriend had Anxiety attack because I left her alone,1,1c6au8i,0,"An Year ago, I (17 at that time) had a girl best friend of same age, let's call her ""Sunny"" for this story.
Sunny had a close female friend, let's call her ""F"" & I had one homie, let's call him ""H"" for homie.
F & H were in relationship but they wanted to keep it a secret from their families, so we decided that like once or twice a month we would meet in a park, F can get permission from her family to stay at Sunny's house(F family never allow her to go to usual public places alone, more like she was constained in her home), then they both will arrive at the Park, me & H will get there just afterwards they arrive. Then Me & sunny will leave them both alone at will talk & roam around the park.
Me & Sunny decided, it's great for them (F&H) to meet sometime because they care for each other
It was pretty normal meetings for 5 months, but once i told them I'd arrive but couldn't because of personal issues(responsibilities)
But then on April 14 (another month later), like normal we decided to meet at the park together in evening, we left F & H alone like usual, and Me & Sunny went the other way, but Sunny wasn't having a great day, so she was stuck on her phone for most of the time, I knew she wanted to talk but wasn't comfortable at all. So, i also stopped talking thinking that she'd need more time to open up, 30min went by in silence, not a single word, she even moved away from where we used to sit together, i felt very distant that time, another 30 min passed by, no response.
I was an overthinker at that age, i was thinking about all negative stuff & getting hurt in my imagination more than in reality, & i thought it's better to leave her for quite a while so that i can get uphold of myself because I wasn't thinking straight at all, so i texted her ""Got some work"", i didn't even talked to her in person or called her even though we weren't even 7 metres apart because i was so arrogant at that time. But i did called H that ""I got some work but will be back as quickly as possible""

Then i went to another park maybe a Km away, i was listening to music to calm my arrogance & think straight, & was in good mood to talk again, this took maybe 20 min, then i went back to the park where all three were, i found F & H, asked about Sunny, I called her & asked where she is , she said on call ""Don't come near me at all !"" , i found her sitting all alone, i thought she was just being sarcastic, but then she started moving away from me, as the park had some elders & children like usual, shouting to call someone is embarrassing, but i did called her again & again so that she'd stop & explain why she doesn't want to talk. But she was moving away faster, somehow i sneak up behind her, but her eyes seemed very wet, i understood that this was something serious, i tried to talking to her asking her what happened, but she said she wanted to go home BUT NOT with me at all cost, i still tried to ask her what happened but she kept refusing all the time, she was breathing heavily & her hands were shaking, she was also stuttering, she even said ""Just go away lots of people will watch us"" But i wasn't the on the verge of giving up, then she said ""I'll shout of you don't leave rn"" then i realised who was the problem it was me, so i called H & F back because Sunny wanted to go home at all cost, Sunny started crying when she got close to F , then H bought some icecream for all of us (even though i refused to buy one for me), he said it will ""cool"" sunny's mind down like yeah that's how that works -_-
H & F asked me what actually happened & i told them ""I'm confused too"" who'd tell they themselves are the problem 
Even while eating the icecream, me & sunny were not talking at all, but she calmed down
Then he dropped those two (F & Sunny) to Sunny's home, & i  alone went my home.
After that, Sunny did responded in chats, she was apologizing for what she said to me, she confirmed that she having serious anxiety at that moment.
After that, we didn't remain ""Best friends"", till now we talk very occasionally.

Context: No, H & Sunny did not like each other at all, so there's no way they'd be engaged.
P.S: Yes, H & F are still Engaged.

Material_Sink4760,Sick Day Guilt,1,1c6am7p,0,"I (27F)have been sick the last 3 days with a cold, today I’m feeling better than the previous days but still not well. When I was younger it was engrained in me by my parents that even if you’re sick you should go to school/work unless you’re on your death bed. Due to this I think I still need to be productive even when I’m not well.

The first day was developing the cold and I could feel it coming on and took some meds but by the end of the night I knew I was for sure sick. The next day, I called into work but still got up and did some cleaning, my parents asked me to help with some yard work and I struggle bussed my way through it. When I told my boyfriend, he was pretty pissed about the fact that I’d even been asked to help. Yesterday was the worst of all the days. I spent 95% of my day in bed- body aches were kicking my butt. When I did manage to make it up I was told I was having a “man cold” aka overreacting to being sick. 

Today I am feeling better than I was the past couple of days but still not good. I feel so guilty for calling in sick though because of this engrained attitude. I can’t sleep more than a couple hours without waking up coughing or being unable to breathe properly. Fact is I work for a clinic and they’re very understanding about this type of stuff- everyone at my office calls in sick whenever they need without any problems and I know I’m safe to do the same, I honestly just wish I could magically overnight unlearn these emotional ties of things that I was taught.

shiaseeds,"Badly need advice (Scared of the future, changes, regrets, love...)",2,1c665z0,0,"***Long post ahead***

In my early 20s, dropped out & working for 2yrs now but planning to pursue my dream to be a vet next year again. I can say that I've been mature earlier due to family problems. I feel like I did not experience being a teen because I was busy thinking of my future & family instead of enjoying being a careless teen. I grew up seeing my parents & people around me just do the worst decisions that impacted my life and I've always told myself not to be like them. So growing up, I've always had a high expectation for everything in my life. 

Now, I know that I am still young and I should be going with the flow and figure it out myself but I am just scared of messing up my own life. I don't want to be living my whole life full of regrets and bad decisions. I want to live my life to the fullest and believe that I deserve to experience every good thing in this world because we only get to live once. **1.)** When it comes to love, i have someone pursuing me right now and even though I don't trust love as much anymore, I still believe that I deserve it. He gives me reassurance, he tells me his intentions, and likes to talk to me all the time. (We've only known each other for 6 months and LDR). The way he does that makes me feel loved and safe  most of the times but sometimes, I just overthink and have random thoughts. I always thought that I want to be loved SO MUCH like in the movies where he does extra things that are romantic and unforgettable and I would start acting distant to him because he isn't doing any of that even though we're LDR. He told me that I am expecting him to know what I want even when I don't say it. Sometimes, I compare him to the guys that have shown me romantic gestures and that hurts him but he always explains and tell me that he will do anything to be with me. I don't know if I am demanding too much and I am setting unrealistic standards or my feelings are valid and someone will prove it to me one day. I'm just scared of love and seeing the kind of love there is nowadays, cheating & betrayal...even if there's no cheating, they just stay ""for the sake of their kids/family"" but no more love left. That's my biggest fear. 

**2.)** I get so scared about my future like I want everything figured out before it's too late. I overthink about my future plans and I get so anxious seeing my current situation yet I can't find myself bringing the best in me since I always lack motivation & resources to keep on going. I don't know if I can survive vet school again but it is the only thing I can only see myself doing. Yet, I am afraid that I am making the wrong decision of pursuing it instead of another career that will make it easier for me to be successful in life earlier. 

**3.)** I also get super negative most of the time. I think that throughout my life, I've been so unlucky and it's so unfair. I think that I'm unattractive, poor, and stupid but people tell & show me otherwise. I am always ungrateful and negative towards everything that is happening to me. I love my parents so much and they also do but because we've been separated my whole life, I feel so distant to them and even if they try, it feels so weird/strange to me and they say I am rude... 

I overthink my life a lot yet I haven't done any changes throughout those years. I am so afraid and confused of what I am doing and I want to start becoming better for real this time. I could really appreciate some advice and even sermons from anyone. I really need it. Sometimes, we just can't see what it clear and I am afraid I'm doing it all wrong. Thank you (:",1713348812.0,

A lot of people just think that our climate problem will slowly become worse and that we are doing enough to combat it and that technology will save us, but I'm involved in the Carbon Removal (CDR) industry, and I cannot tell you how bad it's looking for us, I genuinely cannot. The industry doesn't have nearly enough money to solve the problem, so many are betting that we'd invent some great invention which will allow us to solve the problem but the people, the scientists, the people who actually know the data and the research, they're worried, because the problems we face only keep growing, Earth's Energy Imbalance is off-charts, and I've never seen more people lose hope, extinction rates are unprecedented and our predictions are being termed too conservative, even with ACs people are suffering, especially in hot areas.

It's 35C at night in places and that too, places with ACs. Many IPCC predictions GREATLY underestimate how bad the situation is. I know people whose mental health has gotten so much worse, we were feeling optimistic in 2023, but 2024, and our predictions falling smack, have led to us being more scared than ever, you guys, we've come to realise that even 1.5C is bad, that we should have stopped that at 0.5C, our world will never be the same, ever again, atleast not in 10 generations.

Sea levels are risings, people don't realise how much of a catch all problem Climate Change is, even if we start solving the problem right away, there's still such a harsh road, and that considering that we will not be solving the problem right away.

I'm very worried about what Climate Change will do to us, and it's going to impact us, I don't know how bad, but it's here.",1713362089.0,
_missEltorri_,Struggling to stand up for myself with my parents.,1,1c6agbg,0,"I have ethnic parents. They were very strict with me when I was younger and I feel it's gotten both easier and harder as I've become older. I have a bf now who I've been with since 15 and it's nearly been 4 years which I'm very happy about.  I'm trying to express how tf I can bring up to them that I wanna sleep over Friday nights. It doesn't have to be every week, But It's not about just sleeping over. It'd save my bf time to drive me home when he's tired, plus I'd be able to stay out later with him rather than have to be home by midnight every Friday and Saturday (I work Sundays so can't be out too late sat).

My bf rlly wants me to sleep over and I do too but I'm not sure I'm ready to have that talk with my parents because I know it'll go to shit. They're gonna say no and I'm not allowed and uni is my top priority and smth bad will happen if I do it. I just don't see what the issue is but the last time I brought it up I ended up crying. I'm turning 19 in a few weeks and I'm scared I'm gonna be like 20 or 23 and STILL won't be allowed to sleep over because I won't have the balls to say to my parents ""idc anymore I'm doing it"" or just stay out late with my own bf. I know I'm young but I've been with him for years now. My parents know him. And I'm struggling to come up with a way to stand up for myself. 

The funny thing is they can be easy and hard at the same time with me. For example, we wanna go back to Europe in Dec for a holiday. I asked mum if my bf could come cause he has time off and she said yes but he has to sleep in a seperate bed like wtf. I'm hoping when the time comes if we even go that she'll give up. But I keep thinking to myself surely when I'm 20 they can't just ""say no"" to me cause I'm an adult. I keep getting scared of what they'll do even thought the only thing they've done to me is be very verbally mean to me and say I'm a terrible daughter for wanting to do smth they disapprove of. My bf tells me I need to stand up for myself and I need to stop wanting their approval and I agree with him. It's just hard my whole life growing up they made everything seem like smth I had to earn but I know that they love me deep down they just wanna protect me. 

I'm not sure if I should just wait until I'm 20 and say I'm 2 decades old ffs I'm sleeping over or if I should just do it now. Cause I know people who r like 23 and they do it but their parents don't rlly approve. 

I just donno what to do. I'm lost. Like I do know but idk how to go about doing it cause each time I bring up a sensitive topic like this with my parents they lash out I try not to argue and then i end up crying cause i get very emotional. Would it be better to plan smth for our anniversary instead and that way I'm not ""sleeping over at my bf's"" but we're sleeping together in en entirely different place that's neither our houses? Cause it'll be our money we'd be spending on a small trip for us, not my parents'.

PS, they won't let me sleep over at friends' houses either, barely at cousins unless I absolutely HAVE to.",1713361975.0,
OK-KidAmnesia,I hate living and i'm awful at it,1,1c6aclo,3,"I hate living, i hate waking up early and hate having to get ready to go to uni (and i also have a 3 hour long commute  which makes it worse), i only started uni a week ago but i already hate it. I hate having to talk to people, they often think im strange or crazy bc of the way i express myself/my sense of humor and it's so hard to find people with similar interests. I've been trying to make friends for 3 years and haven't managed to make a single one. I thought uni would be different but people are always the same, everyone is so annoying and i hate having to talk to others (we are forced to do group activities every class).

Me and my gf have been together for 6years already but we dont live together yet. We have over 2hour drive between us so when se meet i usually stay there for atleats the weekend. In the recent years we hve found something we both love collecting: crystals. We order them from abroad and like to open the packages together with video chat.
When i last travelles to her place we opened her crystals together and all of sudden she offered to sell me couple i fell in love with. She also said she had bought some of them thinking that i would like them so she would sell them to me.
I asked her about the price and she started thinking while also mumbling along these words: ""Well i was going to sell this with $10 since i bought it with $5 (it was a very tiny crystal piece) but since you are buying it i can ask for $20""
I dont know about you but i was shocked. If i were to sell anything to my loved one i would give them discount but she thought it would be opportunity to price up. Well since it was way too much for that tiny crystal i said no thank you. Thats when the guilt tripping started.
She was complaining that she bought these crystals just for me and now she has to find someone to buy them since she wont have room for them. I still didnt want to use that much money for it so she continued.
It went on for the whole weekend i was there and in the end i was tired of her complaining. So i bought the dang crystals but i was not happy about it.
Now i have bunch of overpriced crystals laying in my room and im kinda bitter towards my gf. I wouldnt want to be since she can be amazing person too.. but.. yeah.",1713348048.0,

Significant_Ball_390,"When your soul feels weary, find solace in rest.",2,1c65rpy,0,"It's alright to carry a soul that's tender and weary. It's alright to be kind to yourself, to acknowledge your emotions, even when they weigh heavy. It's alright not to have it all figured out, to embrace the sadness without explanation. You don't have to dwell solely in joy or pain. You're complex, a blend of hope and scars, and it's okay to navigate that balance.  
  
When your soul is weary, find solace in rest. Being human is a mix of beauty and burden. Life offers breathtaking moments and heartaches. It teaches, shapes, and challenges us. We must confront ourselves, heal, and summon courage amidst the heaviness.  
  
True bravery isn't always loud. It's found in the quiet moments of resilience. It's facing the ache, forgiving yourself, and striving for growth even in uncertainty. It's reaching towards goodness, trusting in your own resilience, and believing in the possibility of brighter days ahead.  
  
It's natural if your soul feels drained, weary from the battles it's fought. Allow yourself to feel that exhaustion, to acknowledge it without judgment. Emotions are valid, whether they're a gentle breeze or a raging storm within you. Embrace them, for they are part of what makes you human.  
  
In the midst of weariness and uncertainty, remember, you're not alone. There's strength in reaching out, in sharing burdens and joys with others. Lean on your support network, draw courage from their presence. You're capable of weathering storms and finding light in the darkest of moments. Keep moving forward, one step at a time, knowing that resilience lies within you.",1713347236.0,

When my daughter was born a year ago, I started trying to eat better, and it's been fucking rough. Food addiction is fucking real, and so many people just don't understand.

I keep thinking about how there are people who don't know what it's like to see a single Krispy Kreme add and find themselves constantly thinking about donuts for THREE FUCKING DAYS, to not even be hungry and have that voice in your head whispering ""you should down a whole ass chimichanga"", to have a burger be the highlight of your week, or to have every fiber of your being screaming at you to order that fried appetizer sampler. They don't know the absolute euphoria of that first bite after you give in, only to be replaced by deep shame the moment you finish eating. It's indescribable how your brain can go from ""I NEED this *right fucking now*"" to ""this is why your fat you sad sack of shit"" in the span of 2 minutes.

gossipgirl999,I don’t know if these are backhanded comments from my coworkers or not,1,1c69q28,2,"Currently i am in school and i live on my own. So i pretty much do everything for myself without my parents support. 

When i go to my part time job, my coworkers always have something to say. I work with women say about 60 and older. Last weekend i went in to work, and my coworker goes “For someone that has a lot going on you look unstressed or good” i forgot exactly what she said word for word but she said something along those lines. 

In my mind, i just said i literally just woke up and rushed here. That day i didn’t get a chance to do my full makeup, but i just put concealer on, mascara and blush  and lip balm and my hair up. 

Then there’s other times when my coworker tells me “every time i see you you get prettier”. That comment okay it’s fair.

But like i just got annoyed that idk if they think that just because i have a lot going on i’m supposed to look a certain way. Truthfully I  just go to the gym and school. I rarely go out. Me doing my makeup in the morning is my therapy like it makes me feel good about myself. And just because i seem unstressed for someone who has “a lot going on” like they wouldn’t understand how hard it is to fully support yourself, be your own person, and take care of yourself. Mentally and physically it’s a lot. Since im single and have no kids or pets i take the time out of my day to wake up early, do my makeup or even play with makeup and improve it.

dpj2001,Atm my retirement plan is suicide,0,1c69dhf,0,"Now, even if I were rich I’m a bit too young at just shy of 23 to really be considering retirement, but I’ve been trying to plan my future and so inevitably these topics will come up. I’m not looking for some fantastical lifestyle; all I want is to find a partner and one day start a family with her. This however, has lead to a never ending line of financial considerations.

I’m splitting rent with my mom and younger brother and it’s still costing me nearly 40% of my monthly income. I can’t go to college aside from maybe some online courses because I just won’t be able to stay on top of loans. If I end up moving in with a partner that’s ultimately just my same living situation -1 source of income.

I don’t want much, I’ve accepted I’ll never own a house. I don’t even care if I rent my entire life, I just want a family. Even then though, if I and a hypothetical partner can barely make ends meet then having even 1 child will be financially crippling.

I’m still confident things could work, and I’m fortunate enough to have a mother and father I know will offer support so long as they see I’m really trying, but they won’t be around forever. Now, money that’ll be slowly and passively saved up over the years, plus any inheritance I get, will be enough for maybe a few years of retirement. I saw that article that said the majority of Americans need over $1million in savings for a comfortable retirement… yeah right, like I can ever achieve that.

All of these things have me considering what my options are. I refuse to work until I drop, that’s a hell I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. I won’t have retirement money beyond a few years worth, and I want to help any future kid(s) by leaving them something… anything! That won’t happen if my money gets totally sucked dry. As a result I’ve decided that in my 60s whenever I decide I can’t take it anymore, I’ll spend maybe 1 or 2 years just relaxing, maybe doing some cheap/light traveling, and then to ensure my kids have an inheritance and I don’t wind up homeless and bankrupt I’ll kill myself one way or the other.

Now obviously this isn’t the most flawlessly thought out, “retirement plan,” and it doesn’t even take into consideration how my hypothetical future wife would feel. I also acknowledge 4+ decades is enough time for things to change, but as far as my current situation goes this is where I see my life going… and that’s the happy route where I find the love of my life and my familial dreams come true.

I don’t really have a point to make. Screaming into the void just feels good sometimes. I won’t say no to advice if anyone has any.

TLDR: I’m poor, poor, poor, poor some more, and did I mention poor? Future kids won’t be able to get any assistance unless I off myself and let them inherit the few years worth of retirement money I’ll have saved up.",1713359220.0,
PizzasAreFoodJigsaws,I'm still upset 10 years later ,1,1c69csv,0,"I'll try to keep this short but I feel back story will provide context.

I was given my first camera at 7 years old and haven't been any great distance from one since. I've always loved photos.

My favourite ever teacher at 11 years old told us if she had the chance to grab one thing from a burning building it would be her photos. I agreed, they're so important to me.

I got pregnant at 23 and for at least 33 weeks straight reminded my daughter's father to have a charged phone or camera ready and to use it liberally when the time came.

The first photo in existence of me and my daughter (the best thing that ever happened to me, my proudest achievement, my reason to live) that isn't an awkward selfie of her propped up on my shoulder at home is from when she was 8 or 9 days old.. it took 8 or 9 days for anyone to record my shining achievement and happiest moment in life.. and I'm red and bleary eyed from finally cracking and crying and asking why noone had done it for me.",1713359169.0,
noctame,A really bad day today for my mental health and there's just some things I'd like to say,1,1c697qm,0,"I am a 36F who has dealt with varying degress of crushing anxiety and depression for the past twenty years. I can't quite pinpoint the start of it as 9/11 but I was 14 when it happened to give you an idea of the timeline of my life.  


I have been unemployed for the past 3 months having left a job I had been at for the past year, which I used as an escape from a bigbox retail job i had had for 12. I didn't want to work in a store any more, especially after the pandemic and with all the staff cuts my store had had. I was so physically and mentally and emotionally exhausted carrying my department. I had tried asking management to address the working conditions but they have no power in store compared to corporate mandate. When i arrived in the office environment I was basically trained and then left to rot in a cubicle with very little to occupy my 9 hour shifts for three months. This was a job I had to commute 1.5 hours one day with public transit to get to only to rot in my desk area for 8 hours on some days with nothing to do. I began job hunting at that point four months in because I couldn't deal with all the down time.

Four months in one of the other ladies on my team left for a new job and I was given responsibility of her sales rep and all his orders. He was nice about me being new, teached where he could, but even after another 8 months I apparently kept making enough mistakes that on my annual review I was given one month to improve with ""no errors"". I signed the paper but had a massive breakdown immediately after. Just outright quietly sobbing at my desk.  


Throughout the 8 month time period I had been dealing with potential kidney disease red flags due to a condition I was born with predisposing me to kidney failure later in life. So I spent months waiting for a nephrologist appt in december only to find out my protein leakage was minor and I shouldn't be so worried about it.  


Concurrently the niece who is being raised by my mom (yes I'm so pathetic I still can't move out) has been dealing with serious issues where potty training has stalled at the age of 5 and she requires someone to check in at her kindergarten everyday to make sure she hasn't had an accident. Her parents dont pay for any part of her or her brother's care, so we're all immensely cashstrapped right now.  


I've spent the past three months riding savings for a house I'll never rent or own where I live in the Greater Toronto area. The job hunt hasn't been going well for me. I'm in a therapy program online thanks to my family doctor but its only helped a little.  


Every time I login to work on stuff I burst into tears and feel so defeated just participating. I have a hard time with this massive boulder of a thought:

>  
>  
>what is the point?  


What is the point of continuing to exist at this point? I will get older and lose my kidney function and potentially go blind from glaucoma if my syndrome follows thru as predicted. I wont be able to move out and even if I do perhaps that'll happen when I'm ready to retire. I wont be able to afford to retire because I earn money only to have it taken away by taxation like Ei - which I may not even qualify for if I apply or corporate bonus inspired priceflation tactics on literally anything I want to buy.  


I don't understand how I'm suppose to motivate myself to live other than for spite. And in spite of who? What? I can't grasp any meaning to living and while I dont consider myself capable of acting out on any suicidal ideation I live with the anxiety of knowing the ideas are there.   


I'm sobbing right now just feeling the thought right to my core of, Why can't I just be happy? Where did all my hope for a future go? Why do I and so many others have to live just so other people can have dreams fulfilled. 

&#x200B;

What is the point, or how can I figure out contentment in this world I live in. The world where even if all my personal problems disappeared I still have to worry about the future with the global challenges going on. How even if I can crawl out of this hellhole I'm in mentally there are so many other people who still need help. So much need. Why can't it be easier? Do we not have the solutions already?  


I'm having such a bad day in my head and just needed to vent. If anybody has any thoughts feel free to post a reply. I'm hopeful I can receive them with grace and that my basketcase emotional raw wire of a brain will calm the fuck down soon.

Ok-Working8939,I feel terrible (please read),1,1c696g0,4,"So im 18 right now. A year ago I was when I was 17 for some reason I thought being manipulative and toxic is “cool” mostly towards men. I was very mean to the guys who showed interest in me or liked me. There was this guy who liked me a lot and I knew it but I liked his friend so I when he messaged me I just pretended not to know that he liked me even though I knew. I used this opportunity as a way to get with my crush(which didn’t work out). Eventually I just kind of used this guy who liked me as emotional support. When I realised it wasn’t working out with the guys I actually liked I went back to him and he refused(rightfully so). I apologised and started to do better. Then the tables turned and he started insulting me A LOT, he then got a girl and he compared me to her. I got really mad over it and “manifested their break up” and I wished she would die. Later I realised this was wrong so I stopped.
Three months ago in January all of us got into an heated argument and I was already stressed about something so the argument ended up giving me terrible guilt about my past actions. Now I’m stuck overthinking about every single action or mistake from my entire life and it has left with me terrible insomnia since past three months. The guy who I was mean to want exactly a good person either so I didn’t feel bad about doing this to him at first but I should have just left the friendship instead of doing all this.

Sea-Creme5055,not sure where i stand (am i overthinking) ,1,1c693t8,0,"So i became close with a friend in college, we were pretty inseparable. We’d smoke together every night, play video games, hang out every day, etc. 

We both moved home and live in the same area so we continued to do that for another few months. I started noticing her patterns before while we were still in college, but I was so happy to have a ride or die friend that i shrugged it off. we got through a lot together, as college was an interesting time for both of us. 

besides, i didn’t need to be up her ass all the time. 

Whenever she had like an outing or a sorority event that was open invite, she’d like not invite me even when i’m just chilling in the dorm. 

This did bother me a bit, because I was noticing a pattern, but I let it go because i figured maybe she wanted some independence. i did have other friends i would hang out with when this stuff happened, which is healthy. 

But it started grating on me. All of these plans that i’d be excluded from, including random walks over to our mutual friends’s dorm (one of the girls i’ve known since I was a baby).

Granted she would just randomly would go over and would catch an invite from another person in the house and not my childhood best friend, but nonetheless she was still going over, not casually saying hey wanna come, and sneaking off. it felt weird and sneaky considering she was going over to one of my best friends houses. 

regardless i thought i was overthinking it, especially because my childhood best friend wasn’t the one initiating the plans. nor was my college friend.

these behaviors got even worse when we got home. to the point where i feel like she’s trying to push me out of her life. 

she formed the entire new friend group without me in it. she always was weird about “mixing friends” but she was doing it with other people, just not me. 

she has this other friend that she has been close with since high school ish, and they rekindled their friendship since returning home. which was great at first, because me and her get along well. i figured it would be nice to have kick backs now again. 

i thought that- but now whenever i asks to hang she’s always like “can’t i’m with so/so” or a vague “i have plans” 

this lead to another friend group being formed with so/so girl and my so called friends roomates. they always go out and do fun stuff together, and i’m always left thinking- why not me? all of these other friends of hers were mixed, roomate, old friend from high school, etc. but not me? i feel kind of lonely and like somethings with with me, but even if i wanted to try and blend in i feel like ive been annexed off from even attempting to chill with them- because i never catch an invite!

i figured we could all just hang, because im really easy going but  i only hang out with my friend one on one, which is weird. 

i feel like a house troll that she doesn’t bring around other people. this especially sucks because i have been wanting to go out to bars and stuff, and they’ll all do that just w out me. it doesn’t seem too often, but often enough where it stings a little every time. 

i do have other friends i can lean on, but this hurts especially bad because i feel like ive always been there for this person. i feel like in friendships i give so much more than i take. i always brought this friend around all my other friends and included them whenever, but im avoided like the plague unless the plans are 1/1.

i’ve been in an internal battle with myself, wondering why i am always the odd one out, why i can never be someone’s go-to. is it me? why i care so much more about others. it just feels weird and deliberate. i’ve talked to her about it before and she just makes me seem unreasonable, and says i can hang out with other people blah blah. but my thing is, why is she ok mixing other friends but not me. she says “i see u more than most of my other friends” and doesn’t really give me much of an answer, and often times i’m met with anger and coldness for the next few weeks.

something about this doesn’t feel right. i really value this person but i don’t feel valued, more like im kept in her back pocket when she needs someone to lean on. most of all, im just really sad. any advice? ",1713358499.0,

This is my first time posting so I hope that I am doing this right. My gf (25F) Annaliese and I (27M) have been each others crush since high school. She switched states during grade 11 and we tried to keep up with the dating but due to a dramatic experience that took place with me, I became distant with people and would not talk for months. She eventually started dating someone at her new school and married them straight out of graduating. During this time I moved out of the country to study psychology in London. I make a decent salary for myself and have well placed stocks. It is my goal one day to own my own business and be a provider for my family. I have dated from time to time but have not found someone that I can call a wife. Last year Annaliese reached out to me explaining that she is divorcing her husband due to his cheating and abusive ways. We started talking again and realized that we still had feelings for each other but I decided to wait before we went ahead with dating to make sure that she does not want to go back to her husband.   


The Problem  
Before we started dating, Annaliese and I sat down and spoke on what we expected out of the relationship. I explained that I have no problem being a provider for my family and all I want is love, trust and honesty from the person I am with. Annaliese explained that she wants a provider. Someone who can take care of her and provide for her needs and help her out. She also went on to say that she wants someone that can support her lifestyle so that she can quit her job and become an influencer. I agreed at the time and went further to agree with giving her 1k every 2 weeks whenever I got paid. Within the first month everything was going great until we sat down and spoke on finances. After calculating everything up I found that she is now 40k in debt due to lawyer fees for her divorce and some other unpaid bills that she has. Before this I had been sending her anywhere from about $60 - $120 just about everyday to make sure she eats. We had not worked out how I would be able to send her 1K every 2weeks as yet because the charges to send that amount of money from where I am is ridiculous compared to send anything below 150.   
She is now getting frustrated that she has not seen her first allowance as yet even though I am pretty sure the amount I have sent her exceeds that. It recently led to an argument where she stated that if I can not pay it she can be with someone who can. She also stated that she no longer believes in love and only believes a man truly loves her when he pays all her bills. She has also made it clear that she does not want to stay home to cook and clean. I also do believe that she is taking advice from her friends that are trying to be influencers as well because her coworker just applied to quit her job and is moving in with her boyfriend.   
Just to be 100% clear. I do believe that the husband is the head and provider. But I do not want to find myself starting to provide for my gf to the extent of clearing all of her debt just to find out that she  is using me or for her to end up cheating on me especially with someone who cant provide. Not trying to paint her as the bad guy because she has shown multiple signs that she is in love with me. It has not always been an argument about money. It just comes to that when she goes through her finances and begins to over think things. How should I handle the situation? I do not want to make it sound as though I am not interested in providing for her but at the same time I am hearing a lot of narcissism and gold digger mind sets. A lot of this is backlash from from her pass marriage but I do not know what I can do to help make the situation better and help her understand that I am going to help but things take time.

LatterAd8585,Am I the bad guy for not wanting sex?,9,1c5w152,3,"(Sorry about the formatting I’m on my phone) 

I (27f) have been with my boyfriend (27m) for around 3 years now. I don’t even really know what to say other than I’m currently super depressed and have next to no sex drive right now. 

I have recently had a conversation with my boyfriend about my depression, trying to explain that I’m just not in a good mental space and I’m super drained emotionally and he seemed to understand. This is not the first time I’ve had depression since we’ve been together but it’s one of the few times I’ve actually noticed how much it’s affecting me.

Anyways, this talk we had was less than a week ago and it seems like since then he has doubled down on making sexual comments and pressing me for sex. It honestly makes me uncomfortable and makes me feel gross. The way he talks about sex is very unattractive to me right now and I’ve even told him so and he doesn’t stop or try to use different verbiage . He also grabs at my body and I don’t appreciate it even though it typically doesn’t bother me. He tells me how upset he is that we’re not having sex and how he wants more and it makes me angry (even though logically I know it shouldn’t make me angry). I try to avoid going to bed at the same time as him because it seems like he’s trapping me every time I’m in bed at the same time as him and it stresses me out so much.

I understand that it’s not normal to not have a sex life in a long term relationship when you’re not saving yourself for marriage but I just don’t have any desire to have sex and the more he pushes the more I don’t want to.. For whatever reason doing anything even remotely sexual lately makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know, should I just suck it up? I won’t enjoy it but at least he’ll stop bothering me and he’ll be happy.

samichino,I don't know if I was abused or not and feel disgusting.,0,1c68bpl,5,"I feel disgusted with myself even writing this, but here goes. 
Me and my cousin used to play alot together whenever we visited my aunt which was pretty much every weekend. I would have been about 8 or 9 and he would have been 11 or 12. One day he had learned about hypnosis, and wanted us to try it together. I went along with this and he wanted to be ""hypnotised"", so I did something stupid like dangle a watch infront of him and he pretend to be hypnotised. I just told him to do stupid shit like pretend to be a chicken.
Then it was his turn to ""hypnotise"" me. He told me he wanted me to lick my fingers and stroke his face with them, and just kinda weird stuff like that. At age 8 I didnt think this was that stange at all.Then he told me to get on my hands and knees and he smacked my ass and massaged it.  I remember feeling uncomfortable but not saying anything because 1. I wanted him to think I was really hypnotised and 2. because I didn't realise this was actually that bad.  Then he would tell me to wake up and that I wouldn't remember anything that had happened. So I just went along with this and pretended.

This started to happen every time I would visit, but it would get worse every time like he would kiss me, touch my breasts. I would just go along with it until he told me to touch his penis. That was the moment I knew that this was REALLY really wrong, and I told him no. He was absolutely raging that I had been pretending to be hypnotised and that I actually did remember everything he had done to me. He told me then that if I didn't touch his penis he would go downstairs and tell the whole family what we had been doing and they would all hate me. So I did what he wanted me to do. 

This carried on for almost a year, and I just went along with it because I was constantly terrified that he would tell everyone. Just want to clarify here that we never had actual sex, it was all just touching. He would tell me he could do whatever he wanted to me and there was nothing I could do without everyone finding out. 
After some time, family schedules changed, I started going to clubs in the weekend and it meant that I hardly ever saw my cousin anymore other than family events and special occasions. During this time nothing ever happened and I thought that because we were older now the stuff in the past would all just be forgotten. 

When I was 14 or 15 so he would have been 17-18 he messaged me telling me how depressed he was, how he was suicidal because no girl would ever want him. I felt bad for him and told him that they would want him and he just hadn't found the right person. He brought up the stuff we did in the past and basically asked if we could sext. I instantly said no, and was again threatened that he would tell everyone, and also that he would kill himself. So I know I absolutely did the wrong thing here because I was more than old enough by then to know better, but I was so so scared that I was going to be the cause of him commiting that I just agreed. This went on for a good few months before I got a boyfriend and then I point blank refused to give him what he wanted. And of course, he never told anyone and he didn't kill himself.  Which I knew deep down back then that he wouldn't because he's a coward, and why would he tell is own family that we'd been doing that.

I only see him now on Christmas, and it's incredibly awkward. We just don't speak or even look at eachother. I tried to just block it all out my head and I've never told a single person about any of it and to be honest I stopped thinking about it.

Anyway he messaged me yesterday saying he knew what we did was wrong and he feels he wants closure on it. For some reason this has made me so angry. He wants closure? when it was him that manipulated me into doing it all? I suddenly feel so disgusting and so disgusted with myself for going along with it the whole time. I could so easily have just said no at the first request he made back when we were kids. I'm 20 now and I feel like this is the first time I've ever actually felt any emotion about it, I just feel so so so disgusting. I feel like I let myself be so taken advantage of, but then I keep reminding myself that he was literally only 11 or 12 when he was doing these things, a kid himself who was probably just confused.

At this point I just don't know what to do. I feel sick thinking about it but now I can't stop thinking about it. What do I even begin to do in a situation like this. Was it abuse or was it just 2 stupid sick kids.

DreadedSplendour,I’m watching my life fall apart and there’s nothing I’m doing to stop it.,2,1c64lx2,1,"I’m so overwhelmed. I’m supposed to be in an exam right now but I’m still in bed, haven’t studied for my exam.

I tried, but couldn’t. It’s hard to get out of bed. I’m exhausted every day. I’m stressed every day. Even just being determined enough to get me food is a struggle so I eat on the days I can manage.

Idk what is wrong with me. I feel like I need help. I feel like I am stuck in a hole. But I don’t think there’s anyone to reach out to. Because maybe I’m just lazy. It should be as easy as just getting up and reading my notes but I have not been able to. How do I explain that it’s so hard for me, because what is hard about it?

I don’t think I’m depressed, I’m not sad. It’s like the me that says f-word it to everything is getting her way more than the reasonable me. I think I’ve given up. Or I am fed up with this life that was forcefully given to me, where I must be something. That constant pressure of achieving. What if I don’t want to be anything. What happens then.

I think I would be ok with not amounting to anything but people around me make me feel bad for it. If I quit school rn I’ll just be an engineering dropout. The academically gifted kid who didn’t amount to much. Everyone has told me as I was growing up that I was destined for greatness. That greatness usually meant being rich and successful in the eyes of society.

I hate having to be alive because it means that you’ll constantly have to strive. I just do’nt want to do anything anymore. It’s too much pressure for me.

I guess I am a failure. Rn I just want to struggle enough to secure a place to live, in the country side. Grow plants and vegetables. And to write. 
That’s about it. But how do I share it with the peole around me who are expecting different or more from me, especially my parents.

I don’t think I have the energy or resilience in me to continue this path I’m on.
Idk if I need a break or if I need to change paths. 

But I have failed in this path already because this is the second exam I’m missing. The weird thing is that I am not scared of the consequenses at all. I feel like whatever happens happens. I’m tired and just want to sleep.",1713342379.0,

jsjred,i hate myself,3,1c62gf7,2,"I (32F) would say that I genuinely hate the way that I look. For a little back story, growing up in middle school, I was always the girl with the mustache and just weird awkward pre-teen things I didn’t know how to handle that made me not as cute as all the other girls my age. Almost as soon as I got to HS this changed, and this was the start of active social media (myspace also yes, still in middle school yikes) and I was suddenly getting a lot of attention from guys online. So much so, I’d be in random blogs and every person called me jailbait (early 2000s were weird) it was a crazy change for me and I immediately just craved more attention. As the years went on I had finally found a style for myself that I liked and finally was able to accept that I was actually pretty and I felt good about my appearance. Or I thought I did… I would absolutely say I peaked (or started to peak) in high school which is so fucking unfortunate because I hated high school. I was getting more attention online and people in school saw that and always gave me shit for it. I was just more social online than irl and it was slightly noticeable. I still had a lot of friends but most were surface aside from the people I’d been friends with my whole life. Anyways… as soon as I graduated everyone left and moved. I mean everyone I knew. My bf cheated on me while away, my best friends had new friends, I was no longer active online and I was diagnosed with major depression and i was fully anorexic. The anorexia  was mostly due to the depression of the big life switch, but it also made me feel I had control over something, my self image. I was happy with how I looked during this time and I hate that. Finally my mental started to get better, and had new positive life changes, and positive relationships and things were looking up again. Well at this same time, I started to gain weight, and got off birth control. Turns out, I gained 100+ lbs, and it’s because I developed PCOS from taking the pill. Fast forward to now, seeing old pictures of myself absolutely destroys me. I don’t like to reminisce because I look nothing like my older self. Not in a “awh she grew up you can still see the same little Tara” no, like a “holy shit that’s actually you?” kind of way. It fucking sucks. I am literally almost 250 (going from 95 at my lowest and my body “normal” of 135) I grow a full on beard, I’m talking I have to shave sometimes twice daily, that is not an exaggeration, and it is full and black and thick, like a literal man. I am aging, my posture is god awful, I have excessive amounts of body hair, I have a crazy double chin, yes because I’m fat but it’s also genetics, my blonde is already going completely gray and falling out in clumps, the list goes on.

I just don’t know what to do. How will I ever love myself again, how will I ever be attractive again. I just wish I never knew my potential and then I wouldn’t feel this way. I just wish I could show you the stark difference, it haunts me. 

I’ve tried everything. All sorts of diets, sleep changes, supplements, prescriptions from Dr’s and nothing helps. Tried laser hair removal on my face and body, made it worse, beard is fuller. Tried changing my style, tried different active hobbies (in Utah tried every outdoor hobby you can imagine), literally everything I can think of to feel better. I have always struggled with depression since about 18 (hence ed) and it’s been off and on. I have ADHD also but it’s so hard for me to get it treated. They won’t see me for meds for months and I don’t even know if I want to take ADHD meds. Regardless I have also tried therapy, anti depressants etc as I know some of this is mental. I know this post seems stupid but I am tired of hating myself, and feeling bad for myself, and trying to do something over and over again about it and just continuously ending up back at square one. I feel at a loss. My friends are BEAUTIFUL (yes to me but also by society’s standards) and it’s like a knife to the gut. I feel I can’t celebrate them, and I absolutely cannot accept a single compliment from anyone. It’s pity and also unintentionally backhanded (although always the purest of intentions)

I don’t have a purpose for posting this, I have never posted before, I just hate that I hate myself and don’t know what to do about it. I feel unlovable every single day, and feeling that way since 19/20 when I am now 32 is just really starting to hit pretty hard. ",1713333655.0,

I’m genuinely getting annoyed at myself for having these thoughts and I’m really scared I will sabotage my relationship if I can’t get these things under control. Where is this coming from? Why am I jealous all of a sudden when he’s giving me 0 reason to be jealous?

blue_orange93,You showed up in my dream last night...,1,1c67ikj,0,"Why?

We've been broken up for awhile now. Like a LONG while. I'm assuming you're happy in you're relationship-living your life, as am I.

I'm also sure you come across differences in this new person. Every once in awhile my mind wanders, and I'm so glad he's not like you. But here we are.

I'm lying awake at 5am. Looking at the ceiling. Wondering why you're on my mind.

We were at the grocery store and for whatever reason I was only wearing a sweater and no pants. I know I look disheveled, but my friend from high school told me not to worry. It's closing time and no one will see me. ""Okay, we'll make this quick."" I walk away from her as she's getting bread and round the corner, I see you. I freeze and panic. I shop here all the time and don't have to worry about you being there, but for whatever reason... here we are. I rush away to the next thing on my list and I hear my phone ping. ""Is that you that just walked by? Can we talk?"" A very civil text, but I can't bring myself to look at you. Be in your presence. I ignore it and continue shopping. I find my friend and tell her we have to go and she says the store is now closing anyway. We get to the front and you pay for your groceries. It's now my turn and YOU pop up again! You startle me, and ask me how I'm doing. You also ask why I ran away. I don't remember if I ended up telling you why, but then my dream flashes to us walking down the aisles because I forgot bread. We talk about what's happened the last 5 years and I was comfortable. Conversation was comfortable. It was unsettling how easy it was. Then you walked me back to the checkout, paid for my groceries as I was still unloading the cart and left/I woke up.

I already know that there are times I do miss aspects of myself while in our relationship. Unfortunately you killed that part of me that felt safe with people holding my heart and me being myself. I'm with this guy now who understands it's going to take some time to work through trust. He also is so kind and caring. Funny and just overall weird. Like super weird. He doesn't care what people think of him and it's a nice change. He's not looking to impress anyone (outside of me lol) If I was healed fully I wouldn't be so afraid to let this man love me. He hasn't (and I whole heatedly thing he wouldn't ever) hurt my soul the way you have. 

But here I am.
Dreaming about you. 
Dreaming of us having a conversation.
While I'm mid panic attack, and falling into the same hole of, ""oh! We're talking and it's nice because he hasn't hurt me!"" But knowing an argument will come later because it always does. You gaslight me about something. I then become the crazy one and you leave me on the sidelines to rot in my own tears questioning my self worth. All in the while  you go off and do whatever it is your little heart desires. 

Sometimes, I feel broken because of you.
It makes me mad, because I know I'm just processing this relationship I'm in with my current boyfriend. I have to do it on my own since all the women in my family are gone, and I don't have someone who is a motherly/adult figure to give that Mom-like advice when picking myself back up off the ground. Who will give advise in a way I would hear because I'm from their bloodline. They know me in always that are embedded in our souls. They would help me feel like I am good enough. I am worthy of love. I am a treasure. I should iterate that I don't feel this way because of anything my new boyfriend is doing or not doing, but because of my own insecurities. Insecurities that have grown like unwanted vines around my delicate heart. 

There was a post I put on here back in 2017 when you destroyed me. I felt like my heart was a black pit made of twigs and mudd. You left my heart broken, but I build something new. I allowed flowers to grow, vines to pull it together and form something new from the muck you left me with. Now I'm wondering if I let the vines overgrow to protect myself. I added thorns where I didn't need them. Now as I try to get to the healed product underneath, I'm cutting my hands. I'm bleeding from my own doing and I don't know how to prune it back. 

Maybe I'm not broken, but changed. You've changed me into something that I never thought I'd become. So hardened. Unloved from myself. You tarnished the light that lives inside my soul.

I don't think I can ever forgive you for that.

So yes, this is why I panic when I see you. Because I am healing. Very slowly, but it's there. It's just every time I think or see your face, the vines on my heart tighten ever so slightly and the thorns hurt. It draws blood and I'm left in pain. 

Don't be confused, I don't necessarily miss you. You were harmful to me. You were also kind of an ass. Ok not kind of, you were an ass. You broke me in ways that I didn't think were possible to do. Anyway, the thing I'm left missing is me. I miss who I was. The old me died a long time ago, and when my Mom died... I was left with no one. 

So thank you for being the person you were, because I wouldn't have met this wonderful man I'm dating now. I probably would've shown up a hell of a lot less damaged. Would've had more memories with my family and friends I ditched for years to be by your side. But I can't change any of that. All I can do is move forward and make sure I don't make the same mistake again. Which would be to let you into my life. 

Good luck on your endeavors and I hope you've learned how to not treat someone. I also secretly hope you get a taste of your own medicine, but that isn't for me to decide. If you don't, that's fine too... I guess. The universe isn't always just. I've already made peace with that. ",1713353633.0,
plsgivemeclearskin,I don’t remember my first kiss/first time hooking up with someone,5,1c60duk,1,"I was really drunk about to turn 21 at my friend’s party. I had never had my first kiss or first anything with anyone. I went into the party wanting to get things over with because I never experienced what most people around me have experience (i.e. being in a relationship, first kiss, hooking up, etc). Even though i went in with that mindset i didn’t think it would actually happen. I had been to parties before in college and nothing happened even though i wanted someone to notice me. This time at my friends party, i did get noticed. Apparently by more than one person. I hit it off with this guy I met for the first time talking about random shit from the usually what are you majoring in, what career path are you on, what year are you. But then we started to talk about more serious topics but jokingly. 

At this point I’m drunk but i didn’t realize how drunk i was. He was about to leave and i felt like i was losing my only chance at experiencing something. But again i was drunk and tired so he left while i was lying in my friend’s bed for a while. Once i found out he left, apparently i called him to come pick me up. I genuinely don’t remember calling him but he came back and picked me up to his place. Once i was at his place, my memory of the whole thing was fuzzy. Certain things i can picture but i don’t really remember much. I wasn’t really present for most of it. We didn’t have intercourse but we did pretty much everything else. He saw all of me and i saw him but it just feels weird to me that i don’t remember what it felt like. I just remember the kisses being wet and oral i guess. 

It kinda makes me feel empty inside that it happened. But at the same time, i don’t have any resentment towards him specifically. He was respectful and stopped when i told him to and i was pretty demanding with certain things even though i was drunk out of my mind. It just sucks being in this gray zone of feeling empty about an intimate experience that i don’t remember and didn’t fully get to experience after waiting for so long. I am glad that we didn’t end up have intercourse, but we did attempt. I just have problems with penetration due to my vaginismus so thank god for her lol. I have talked to a therapist at school about it at the time and cried about it but maybe it’s best that i don’t remember a lot from that time. I feel like this is partly affecting my ability to be intimate and get into a relationship with someone. I haven’t kissed or talked to anyone since this happened. I do think it’s because i don’t have confidence in myself or feel like i could be in a relationship in general, but this experience doesn’t help either. 

I just needed to type out how I’m feeling now that it’s been some years. I kinda wish i was more patient with myself and didn’t let myself get that drunk so i could be present in that moment. Because even though i have “experience” hooking up with someone, if i get intimate with someone again, I’ll have to start at square one because I don’t remember how to do anything. I just hope i find someone patient and understanding towards my situation. ",1713326450.0,
SecretsIntoTheAbyss,My boyfriend won't talk to me about how he is feeling - TW: Grief/suicide,1,1c67h4e,0,"Both me and my boyfriend are going through grief and currently long distance. I lost my soul cat, who was one of my reasons of living, in an accident, so it was sudden and traumatic. My boyfriend then lost his old best friend (they were not speaking at the time) to suicide.

We haven't really been communicating very well. We both have shut each other out, but I have been keeping him updating in how I'm feeling. He rarely speaks.

The other day he messaged me saying ""I'm sad about \[name of my cat\] and \[name of best friend\] - I am going to die alone.""

This triggered such a fight or flight response in me, triggered my anxiety, so I asked him to explain further and speak to me. I left it for a day. He read my response but didn't reply. I can't help but admit I felt pissed off with him ignoring/ghosting me, so I spoke to him about it again and told him that ghosting someone who's asking how you are isn't very nice or fair. Again, he read it and nothing.

I'm frustrated, upset and confused. In a way, I feel disrespected. I don't know why he won't speak to me? I'm very open with my feelings but it doesn't seem he feels the same way.",1713353495.0,
Careful-Ad6659,Worth it pa ba?,0,1c67h1v,1,"What are your thoughts?  
5 years na kami and almost 3 years ng nagli-live in. My family knew about us. First week palang namin sa relationship, nag-insist na siya na mag-pin ako ng location. First month of our relationship, kinuha niya rin passwords ng socmed ko, lahat. Whenever I open this up, iniiwasan niya and nagagalit siya and accuses me of cheating. Lumipas ang almost 2 years, he found out na may kinausap ako sa alter during our relationship but never ako nakipagmeet. I admit na cheating 'to, I know na mali ako, nagawa ko to kasi I feel like nasasakal na ako because he isolated me from my friends and feel ko nasasakal na ako that's why nakipag-usap ako sa iba to find comfort and attention but this is not to justify it. Tinago ko and he found out. I was wrong. I deleted my alter.  After that, sobrang nag-away kami pero we continued our toxic relationship - to the point na nagkakasakitan na kami. Year after, mas naging strict siya. I admit, sweet siya, loving caring, but for me, the ff things are too much na.  
1. My boyfriend setup a CCTV sa condo. When I opened up about me being uncomfortable with it kasi wala na ako privacy, he accused me na bakit daw ako magiging uncomfy if wala naman daw ako ginagawang masama and even accused me of cheating na kung sino dinadala ko. Also, wala rin ako access sa CCTV.   
2. Lahat ng location ko, tinatrack niya.    
3. Lahat ng kasama ko especially boys, sinasabi nyang nakikipagsex ako pero never naman talaga ako nakipag sex sa iba during our relationship. Wala rin naman ako choice since workmates ko sila.   
4. He always question me whenever lalabasan ko, konti lang cum ko. Sinasabi niya na nakipagsex daw ako sa iba muna.  
5. Ayaw niya ako mag-jakol on my own, kailangan kasama siya.   
6. Everytime I trim sa baba, ina-accuse niya ako na I'm doing it to please my workmates kasi raw makikipag-sex ako sakanila.  
7. Hindi ako pwede umalis ng ako lang. He always insist na sasama siya, even tho bawal ang plus 1. So ang mangyayari, I won't tell him na may naga-ayang friends sakin.  
8. He always check my phone - screen time, kung ilang oras ko ba ginagamit ang app and kung anong app. He always insist na may grindr ako but never naman ako gumamit ng app na yun  
9. Everytime na nakikipag-break ako, ayaw niya. Wala ako magawa, I tried. Siya lang lalapit and pipilitin maging okay kami pero cycle lang.  
10. He wants to marry me raw but wala naman siyang trust. I always reassure him pero wala talaga, I did all my best, eliminated all means para di siya magworry.   
11. Pinipilit niya ako makipag-sex. Hindi ako malibog na tao, alam ko sa sarili 'yun, minsan lang. Lagi akong occupied sa work ko or stressed ako, focusing on my career. Sex is not my stress reliever. Whenever ayaw ko makipag-sex, nagagalit siya. So ang mangyayari, pipilitin ko sa sarili ko. Sometimes I feel na sexually abused ako but pumayag rin naman ako - but hindi ko talaga gusto. He always say na deprived daw siya whenever na sasabihin kong next time pero binibigay ko naman lahat ng kaya ko.   
12. Lagi niyang sinasabing may kabit ako. Wala naman talaga. Wala rin ako masyadong social life aside sa mga close friends.  
Recently, I found out na there are some things na tinago niya sakin. Di niya sinabi sakin na lumabas siya with his guy friend na silang dalawa lang. I just found out lang sa phone niya - di ko kasi talaga pinapakialaman and nagkataon lang while I was checking on something. Marami rin bagay na pinagsisinungalingan niya pero I let it slide since I don't want to be toxic. May feeling din ako na may ginagawa siyang masama pero hinahayaan ko nalang since issue na naman. Nasanay na rin ako na ako nalang lagi iniipit so hinahayaan ko.

Curious_Base2833,Gym is getting popular and I'm getting frustrated,12,1c5sj28,9,"There's a small gym that my apartment complex has, nothing major just some weights a few treadmills and cycling machines. I've been going there about 4-5 times a week since I moved over here, and nine times out of ten there was no one there. It didn't matter what time of day or what day of the week I went it was empty. I did my workout, cleaned my stuff, and left.

But. Idk as the past few months have been going by I've been seeing a small increase in the people there. At first I may have saw someone there once or twice a week, but now everyday I go in and there's at least 3-5 people now. Which isn't bad obviously but it's a been a slow increase of people. And I feel frustrated. I know it's a public space and they're allowed to use it but I can't help but feel agitated.

There's one dude who blasts his music on the loud speakers, another one keeps bringing a tripod, at some point some guy kept dropping his weights after finishing his sets (keep in mind there's only one set of weights for 5-50lbs) and he broke the ""cover"" of the weight. A lot of people also keep leaving their weights and empty water bottles everywhere and not cleaning their equipment. There's also a pair of gals who come in start yelling and making tiktoks and then leave. One day I caught someone walking flipping barefoot on the treadmill.

Once again I know it's a public space, but I can't help but want the quite gym no one seemed to notice again. ",1713304449.0,
GilbertT19,I’m worried my friends think I’m an total idiot,1,1c676ny,0,"Especially as of yesterday. We were playing some card games and in one of them, I confidently either lost or made mistakes even though I wasn’t the only one learning that game.
Idk if it’s just my bad reaction, low attention span or whatever but it sucked

Then on top of all that, there’s this system my college used where we have 2 sets of points for purchasing items and in one of those sets I have like a crap ton of money left. Apparently once we graduated this may, I’ll lose 50% of that money and can’t get it back. I personally don’t care because it’s not the end of the world for me to lose that money but when my friend saw that upon using my phone it order food (I let him) he just blurts it out in front of everyone else around me like I’m an idiot. And they all acted like “Bro what?”…. Including a girl I used to have feelings for 

This was just for yesterday. I tend to try to make folks laugh by saying out of context stuff and a lot of the time it works, but even though I sometimes go overboard with that (admittingly) I’m not sure if that also adds up to them thinking I’m an idiot

Look, I just can’t pick up some stuff as fast as them. There is some good stuff I’ve said to them believe me. But still. I can’t help but fear that they think I’m a total idiot",1713352518.0,
Elijahvince12345,My take on High school Romance.,1,1c675kh,0,"Growing Up, I never really liked the idea of Dating someone. It clashes with the things I’d love to do in the near future. I mean, who would want to take care of someone when you can’t even take care of yourself, right?

The year I started Highschool, I was returning from an Old Academy. So it was a pretty fun experience having to restore memories with people I had known from the past. 

I get to meet some new Transferee’s when I was gone. They were pretty chill.

But that thing I was most interested about, was the old students having relationships with the newer students from the later years.

Seeing them be affectionate for each other really made me question, “What would happen if I was in their position?”

So for 3 Years, I decided to start a mission called “Crush Hunting.” I think it’s pretty self explanatory on what that means lol. At the end, I never really found what I wanted in a girl. Every girl those days were far from Traditional female.

That same year, I started watching Anime Rom-Com’s (e.g. Toradora, Kaguya-Sama, SNAFU!) and ‘til this day, I LOVED watching anime’s that involve Romance in them.

So, I took another shot at Crush-Hunting.

I eventually found a girl that I liked. To my surprise, she also liked me. I kind of knew that from the start because she would give subtle hints like playfully hugging me and teasing me.

And after what seemed to be eternity, she confessed to me. 

So you’re probably thinking, “eh he also said he liked her from the beginning as well, and then they end up dating blah blah blah.”

Well, I rejected her.

During our play-tease relationship, I realized something. I was looking for something that wasn’t even there. I was looking for something that I thought would make me happy. Turns out, I was already happy with what I’ve got. Friends.

This eventually made me realize I was AroAce. It means that you have a hard time trying to imagine being in a relationship with someone.

That rejection was the exact moment I found my true self. And I’m happy I did the right call.

Keep in mind that we've never went on vacation together so that would be the first time. However i feel like they don't want me in anymore because one of them messaged me telling me how ""scared"" she was of going on vacation with me cause we sometime disagree on stuffs and that we needed an honest conversation before buying any tickets and everything. I then asked my other friend what she thinks of this and said she understands her because she had many bad surprises when she went on vacation with her friends before. Anyways, i told them that it's understandable and that if we plan everything early then the trip will be fun and fine, but the one who messaged me keeps bringing up the fact that we don't get along on certain stuffs which have no correlations at all with the trip we're planning. It's so annoying because i feel like i have to prove myself to them so that they think i'm worthy to go on vacation with. It also hurts my feelings because i never once thought about having dramas nor anything bad with them but she's trying to push this narrative onto me and feel like she expects me to create drama when she's the one saying nonsense.

BetterSuccess8574,I wet myself in public,1,1c66pmn,2,"I'm so mortified that this actually happened and I've been stressing about it non stop. 

I (18F) went to the movies with my friend (18f) and ran into a family friend (40M) who was watching the same thing as us. We'd been drinking a lot of soda and I'd already been to the bathroom midway through the movie. 

Anyways, we get out and family friend offers to catch up after movie at pub next door. We accept, and at that time I didn't really need to go to the bathroom again but probably should've. 
We grab drinks, sit down, and are talking for a while. I start to need to pee a lot more now, but definitely manageable. However, there hadn't been an appropriate point in conversation to excuse myself so I waited. All of a sudden it got alot worse and I literally couldn't stop myself as my bladder almost fully emptied onto the chair I was sitting in mid conversation with my friend and the family friend. I was so mortified and in shock that I didnt even consider getting up or admitting it to them. I sat there and held conversation for far too long until the family friend left and just my younger friend and I were there. 
I couldn't bring myself to look, but it definitely would have left a noticeable puddle/wet area on the chair and maybe a little on the ground (we were seated outside) 
Out of shame, I couldn't bring myself to tell the staff either and hoped they would just assume it was a spilt drink and mop it up. 

On the other hand though, now I am worried that they would try and follow it up if they figure it out, and worst case the only person that had proof of being there was the male friend who paid for our drinks. I honestly don't know what id do if it ever came out that I did such a horrible thing but I honestly am speechless as to how the whole situation even happened. It's days later and it feels like I've almost dreamt it I'm in that much shock. 

Am I a bad person? If something does come up about it and the truth gets out how am I supposed to deal with it? I haven't told a soul and I'm just so distraught and shameful about it, I honestly don't know how I would cope, it's bad enough already... help?",1713350866.0,

Since then I’ve also started to get muscle twitches in my legs. One part of my leg will shake for a few seconds and then it stops. My legs also feel like they’re shaking when I lay down. The neurologist I’ve been seeing gave me gabapentin for the twitches and prescribed physical therapy for something called occipital neuritis. I just stopped the gabapentin at her recommendation because my twitches have become more frequent. I’ve taken multiple supplements and changed my diet, but still nothing has gotten this to stop.

Loose-Tea-7478,I search in money the appeasement and fulfilment only myself and my species can give,1,1c66mfa,0,"I (31F) don't remember when it started, but I think it has to do with the truths revealed about others and myself within my family dynamics and after much observations of others' ways of thinkings through movies, songs and other means.

Some people grow up believing love is unconditional and can last forever, and feeling like they have a place to call home. While I don't think love is purely self-serving, I can't identify with any of those ideas. And as a result a sense of ownership and liberation but also angst, loneliness and danger lives with me as I navigate through life.

I am not someone who knows how to ask for help probably because I know how irrelevant the help people can provide is. Ultimately, it comes to us accepting reality and making adjustments in our day to day life to get ourselves to a better emotional state.

Meditation and mindfulness have truly made a positive impact on me. As I practice, I have more margin within myself to observe and respond, instead of overreact. However I keep on truly believing that people equals pain and confusion, and money is what matters most, is the only thing you can trust.

In addition to that, I've been flat-sharing for almost 10 years and I'm exhausted. I realise a substantial part of this exhaustion is caused by my own conditions: I'm a light sleeper since I looked after children and my grandmother and I keep on expecting other people to be a perfect roommate which is one that doesn't exist, as all I want is to live alone.

I moved to a city that I love but due to its prices I will have to flatshare for at least a year or two before being able to afford a house. On the contrary, if I go back to where my family lives - dysfunctional to say the least yet doable for a few months - I may be able to speed up the process and buy a really nice house next year. I will also be living near my cousin, who I love.

I am determined to go back to truly speed up my savings and be able to finally live by myself without having my money going to another's wealth instead of mine. I will have space to invite friends and family over which is amazing.

As I write this, I recognise the truth is that peace is never guaranteed and the moment you have neighbours, for instance, you may be subjected to a lot of issues.

I truly hate people, I fear their lack of self-awareness and respect, but money never fails. Let alone in the capitalistic world we live in. 

I realise a huge part of the problem is that I run away from discomfort while discomfort is often not only a gift but also essential for growth. It's just that I want to live alone. I want to sleep well and feel free.

Am I hurting myself by moving up north for a few months instead of delaying buying the house for a year or two and keep on exploring this city?",1713350543.0,
TA20212000,Working with Children is Heartbreaking,54,1c5fak1,7,"TL;DR: Working in education is soul-crushing. I need to vent about it.

I need to get this out and ""off my chest"". I don't know where to post this either, so I came here.  

Someone on Reddit a ways back (I don't remember where) wrote about how educators aren't (I think this is what they said) feeling burnout like so many are saying, but more so moral injury from what we're witnessing & struggling with on a day-to-day basis. 

And I'd like to stick my hand up and say that I'm feeling burnt out BECAUSE of the moral injury. 

It hasn't stopped. For years. 

My latest grief... My grade 2 student. Operating at a Kindergarten level. In my literacy class. There's 5 minutes worth of nightly literacy content review. Monday thru Thursday. I remind the whole class what the pay off is for getting it done (huge reward every Friday) and that they need to do their review with an adult. 

This student tells me their grandma's working tonight but they'll try to do it ""by themself"". I ask who else might be there to do it with them. They say that their mum is going to be home, but that they don't know how to do any of it. I ask them what they mean. They said the last time they asked their mum to help them with the content review, they ""looked at it and got mad and said she couldn't do it"".

[[[So now I'm trying to grapple with (+ integrate into my mental landscape) the idea that I'm doing everything I humanly can to teach little children how to properly speak, read and write. And they have no one at home to back them up and help them with their education because it's highly likely that their family members may be illiterate....]]]

And this is the same child coming to school with makeup on. And 1 inch long press ons; they cannot even grip their pencil properly. With a brand new iPhone they got at Christmas that they keep sneaking off to hide with at recess. 

We've got kids in grades 4-7 telling us that they're going to sleep at 4 am on a Tuesday. Or coming in with one hour of sleep. Falling asleep at their desks. On the floor. And a couple of times, nodding off on the toilet in the bathroom. They can barely read. They can barely write. They can't count by 2s, 5s or even 10s. All of them come to school without food in their bellies.

But these babies know about famous people. And all sorts of anime shows. And Andrew Tate. And YouTube shorts. They can tell us about the latest conspiracy theories and how their parent told them that the internet is going to get ""knocked out when World War 3 starts"". When the eclipse happened earlier this month, a few of the students didn't attend school because their parents thought the apocalypse was happening. These babies have TVs and gaming systems in their rooms and no one takes their phones away at bedtime so they stay up all night. 

No one reads to them </3. 
There are no bedtime stories. 

My heart just feels broken for them. Finished work today feeling like my brain is mush. We aren't paid enough to face what we are facing. We are understaffed. No community or real parental engagement to speak of. Our last parent teacher night, not a single parent even came. The needs are so high. 

A family member/fellow educator works in a different community, subbing soley in SpecEd classrooms. The situations they describe to me on the regular are insane. Certified professionals speaking cruelly to children. Being harsh and rough with them. Collusion between administration and these staff members. And on other occasions, incidents that are simply intolerable. And I've seen so much of this in my time in this field as well. 

One of recent memorable note they described to me though, was of a SpecEd classroom where my family member witnessed an older student pulling out his penis in class and masturbating at his desk. When the classroom teacher was informed, they grabbed a blanket and threw it over the students lap and allowed them to continue and finish. Right there in the classroom, students & staff in close proximity. 

And we are both operating as Educational Assistants within the system. But my family member is a seasoned teacher having worked in the system for 5 decades and myself for more than 2 decades. I also teach literacy & numeracy. My family member refuses to teach permanent full time though and they have operated this way for the last 10 years of their career because the conditions of employment in education have grown so poor. We are highly educated & experienced individuals who are incredibly effective and excel at our roles in working with children.

And if you go online and browse job listings across the country for Educational Assistants.... So many employers offering $16/hr. $20/hr. $22/hr. A couple I saw started at $14/hr. Very rarely was there anything in the $25+/hr range.... This is in Canadian Dollars to boot, mind you. 

And I'm telling you.... Education needs to take a hard look at the front lines. Administration and governments need to understand what's happening with students and staff in schools. I think there is some awareness as I've been hearing of achievement tests being cancelled for English this year because last year's tests scores were so abysmal. But that only scratches the surface of the tsunami coming societies way in Education. 

I feel like I'm screaming into the void. We all know there is a huge problem here. I don't know if any of us have a clue where to start in solving it or who to even turn to to help us. 

A fair chunk of parents completely loathe us nowadays, even though we are the only ones with their children for a majority of their childs waking hours Monday thru Friday. Most parents don't know or understand what we are going through or dealing with. Nor do most of them seem to care. 

I know that students don't have their basic math facts down before they hit high school. I know that printing their own names and reciting their own address and phone number is difficult for them. I've had students in middle elementary not even know the alphabet. And they just keep getting sent forward to the higher grades. It's horrifying. 

So yeah. Just needed to rant and cry into my coffee a bit. I started writing this when I got home from work last night and am finishing writing this before I get ready for work this morning. 

We love our students. Most of us are doing our very best. And it is never going to be ""good enough"" because of the epic amount of deficiencies within the system. 

We are completely wrecked by what's happening to/with/for these children.

fluffybunny247,I think my best friend might have succeeded in killing herself today. ,3,1c613qu,5,"These last couple of messages she sent me ""please dont be mad at me if i don't make it"" then it was ""i cannot be helped past this point nor do i want it"" and the final was just ""sorry."" I know that she's been struggling with depression and that was one of the things we connected about, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with anxious distress back in 2013. We've been talking for what seems like months, even though it's only been a few weeks. We connected instantly.  It pretty much started becuase I made a post in another group looking for someone to game with. 

We got to talking and I asked her if she had Diablo 4 became I really wanted to play some co-op. She said that she didn't have it or have the money to buy it. She told me that she has a PS5 and I have an Xbox. So I went to a site and bought her a code for a $55 gift card.  I sent her the code and she asked if I was serious and she asked ""Do I  have to send you feet pics now"", I responded with ""please don't"" and we both burst out laughing. That's when it started. Then we spent our days texting or talking over voice chat. That's when we started casually flirting with each other. Things were so easy with her. I'm quite shy and usually have a rough time chatting with people. But with her, with her it was different. The words flowed like a river. She's amazing. She's super smart, carismatic, funny, and extremely easy on the eyes hahaha. And I could just be myself with her. 

When she sent me those messages I instantly tried calling her, to no avail. I sent multiple messages and I've tried calling about 3 dozen times. I would've tried 911 but I was only aware that she lived in North Carolina and was about 2 hours away from Charlotte. I was in the military for 16 years, drop me into a combat zone, and I'm you're guy.  But this... this I can't fix or even help her.  I'm at the point where I'm just hoping the pills that she used just put her to sleep and she'll wake up tomorrow in rough shape, but alive or she came to her senses and contacted emergency services and is now in the hospital. I just can't bear(bare) to imagine that she's actually gone. I'm hurting so much inside. So I did something I haven't done in about 10 years, and that's drink. Maybe that's why I'm posting this here for everyone to see, because I've spent the past 3 hours drinking. But guys, I have no fucking idea what to do and I'm really scared. I can't stop fucking crying, which isn't helped by the fact I have BPD aka Emotional Intensity Disorder. I don't want to lose my friend, I've never felt so helpless or terrified. I'm not sure I can handle it if she's actually gone, my world would shatter. 

I'm going to stop rambling now. I'm going to light up a cigarette and keep drinking and hope it helps to numb the pain

She always has problem with me because my parents spoiled me and always shows love.

When we started  high school she was that kind of a shy kid never talk to anybody and always sits alone. I felt bad for her and I let her meet my friend and be friends with them even though my friend did not like her first i begged my friend to talk to her and give her a chance and we all been friends since then,  she started to act weird and mean I didn’t say anything because i didn’t want to hurt her but she really started to act different around my friend and made fun of me every time I said something I really wanted to cry that day but I didn’t know that was just the beginning.

since then she started to talk shit about me behind my back and make things up and my friends started to hate me and told me how can you possibly do that and I was confused I didn’t know what to say, and find out that she made up stories about me bing mean with her and played the victim because I was my family favourite she got jealous and ruined my friendship, I was always the favourite girl in my family and everyone loved me and always compliments me about how pretty I am so she got jealous of me.

so I started to make new friends and I ignored her so she got mad she didn’t not have the spotlight , she started to talk about me again with my friends but this time they didn’t believe her so got mad again , I really didn’t care at this point I know she Wes fake because she never been mean in my face and act all innocent , I started to ignore her more on family events and my family noticed something was wrong , so my aunt told us both to tell what happened , so I started to say that “she been mean to me and I started to ignore her” she deny and act like the victim and said that “she started to ignore me but I didn’t do anything “ and got angry I was in so much stress so I started to cry and she got upset and lift everybody was on my side and know she was lying.

the next day I went to school and everyone was staring at me so I know that she told everybody what happened and lying about everything.and I told my friends the truth about what actually happened. and now nobody likes her even my family . and her friends are as bad as her and l still ignore her and , Lia told my sister that why is your sister ignoring me and my sister ignored her as well .

Saulcrxzcr7,AIW for being in this crazy relationship,2,1c62zw7,0,"I (26M) have been dating my current partner (24f) for 3+ years. I met her the end of 2020 in October. We were both going through a difficult time when we met. She had lost her previous partner in an accident and was mourning that loss. While I was morning the loss of two relatives that year (one being my grandmother who was very important to me). At first we spoke as friends, I didn’t really see her as a potential partner I truly spoke to her as a friend and even more so just being there for each other for the things we were going through.  Truthfully I put aside what I was going through and tried helping her more through what she was feeling. I know at the time she felt suicidal. I feel now that maybe I should’ve helped myself more because by wanting to help her I just put aside my pain and never dealt with it. Move on a few months. Things are rocky they are here and there. She’s still dealing with the loss but I guess we both developed feelings for each other but in a way she still loves her Ex(which I didn’t realize to what extent at the time). How did I know? She confessed it to me after sex. She had the pictures of them and him at her home on her wall. She had there date as her phone pass code. When I asked her if she ever had a kid what would she name him and she said her ex’s name (I didn’t find out that was his name until months later). She still has contact with the ex’s family. Telling her ex’s sister “oh I can’t sleep without looking at (ex’ s name) pictures.” Meanwhile I’m loosing sleep to keep her company because she worked night shifts I wouldn’t sleep to stay up and talk to her. I would set alarms to wake me up in case the sleep beat me to be able to respond because I knew as soon as it was morning she’d be sleep all day. Despite all that I still continued to stick around (I know, dumb). 

Move forward a couple more months. I’m moving to her town. When we met we lived an hour away from each other but my parents end up buying a home in the town where she lives and know we’ll be closer and see each other more. I tell her a month in advance when we are moving and I ask her if she can help me that weekend and be with me since I was going to be alone that first weekend in the house since my parents were still going to be at the other house helping the movers with packing. She agrees and when the time comes to me moving. She lets me know that she’s going to be taking her aunt to a family party in a town two hours away and wouldn’t be able to help me. Mind you this whole month I’ve been reminding her about her agreeing to help me and I’ve mentioned it to my family that she was going to help and in one day she decides to go with her aunt instead… but again she came back from the party and apologized and I stuck around… (I know, dumb) 

A couple months later we find out she’s pregnant. Which im not going to lie we weren’t being really safe but still came as a surprise because according to her she could not get pregnant and to be totally truthful we had been having unprotected sex for a while and constantly and she hadn’t got pregnant…. Anyways, I didn’t feel ready to be dad and honestly I was afraid and I know my reaction to us finding out wasn’t what she was expecting. Regardless I stuck around I tried to get my mind right I was going through a lot and in the spirit of being completely truthful here. I did at one point bring up the option of maybe not having the baby. She declined and even though I thought it would be vest to not have it. I let her decide. Things became even tougher during this time I got depressed. She was going through her things too and simply no communication. She bought a house with her family (which we both have agreed now that it was a big mistake mostly due to her parents and we should’ve looked for something for us. My in laws are hard to deal with specially my mother in law but that’s a whole different long story). We began to have more arguments over our pasts, the baby, our families. I didn’t feel I could come to her with my problems so at the time I would speak to a friend that I’ve never met in person but have known her for years online. I confided in her since I couldn’t come to my own partner with my problems because I felt like she disregard my feelings and make what she felt more important. I’m not proud of it but we did get aggressive with each other at points. I never actually punched or threw a fist but I did shove her or held her with lots of strength which I know is just as bad. I did do some stupid things during that time due to my depression. For example, I would cut my self, try and make myself go unconscious. I took a whole bottle of pills hoping for something to happen. I would even go out at night on walks hoping to get myself into danger(I have a vision impairment. I have night blindness). Sadly nothing ever did, I’m still here. (This all happened 2021) 


Early 2022, my sons born. She’s going through her postpartum despresion, I’m going through a tough time being a first time dad, dealing with my own depression and now trying to help her with hers. A couple months pass and we have another big argument things got physical. She kicks me out middle of the night, throws my stuff out. I not knowing what to do decide to take time go to Mexico and give her space. During this time she is not speaking to me but she is hacking into my socials trying to spy on who I’m speaking with and stuff like that. I know because alerts I’d get to my phone and nobody else knew my info other than her. Anyways I leave for like 2-3 weeks we talked and agreed we loved each other and missed each other. Months later another big fight and again a lot of these arguments had to do a lot with my MIL who really would get into our business. Again we fight things got physical and a few weeks later we made up. We had one more third big fight/argument. This one landed me in jail for 3 days for DV. Again I never hit her but when she called the cops on me because her mother insisted she’d do so, I admitted to them that I shoved her off me. Even though she got physical with me too they ended up taking me even though I was already at my parents house too. 

I come out of jail and in my mind I said I’m done I can’t do this anymore even if she looks for me I’m not going back. Especially since I found that while I was locked up she through my belongings in my parents trash and they fished them out when they saw them and brought them in. Eventually she contacted me so I could see my son and obviously I wanted to see my son so I responded. To make it short, I folded. I so badly missed my son and I missed being around him all the time and putting him to bed that I gave in and we got back together…. 


Since then we have had arguments but I’ve controlled myself to not get baited into being physical simply because of the experience of being in jail. We do argue and she snatched my phone and she tries to anger me but I try my hardest to get composed. Obviously I’m human and I have emotions and I do blow up sometimes and I yell and tell her stuff I later regret but it something she does back to me too. 

I’ve tried to make this as summarized as possible but the story is just to long to post. There is lots of stuff I’m leaving off but I’m trying to put as much as possible info that I think is important….

laliah_x,Honestly money would solve most of my problems,1,1c66945,0,"TW: mention of suicidal ideations/depression 

I am 26 and I have a debt of roughly 26k€. Most of it is a student loan, I never finished studying because I am struggling with lifelong depression/suspected ADHD. 

I am working fulltime and I don't make terrible money, but with impulsive spending (I really try to work on this), having to pay back the loan and the rising cost of living I barely scrape by each month. 

I know that most of this is my own fault, sure I did not choose to fall ill but I chose to stay in uni when I long knew that I would never finish my degree. I chose to lie to everyone to keep up appearances. Honestly for most of my uni time I thought I would not live past the next month so I didn't worry too much about money. 

Yet here I am roughly 4 years later with a bunch of debt, still depressed tho slightly better. And honestly the thing I am most depressed about is my debt, I feel like if I could just pay it off I would be immensly happier. Like I don't even want excess money, I just want this reminder of the past gone.

I know life doesn't work like this and I know I'll probably carry this reminder of the worst time of my life around with me for years and years to come. But sometimes I just like to think about the possibility of having it gone and my life be a little easier.

Broad_Swimming3010,I'm 24(M) and I've only had one relationship,1,1c65tgv,0,"I'm starting to come to terms with how much my relationship with my mother has fucked up my ability to bond with women. I grew up with my mother who was diagnosed with acute schizophrenia and hasn't been taking anti-psychotics for as long as I've been alive. She also grew up being sexually abused by her father, beaten, eventually put into foster care and split from her siblings. Where in the abuse continued.

After my dad got custody of me when I was 8 years old she started doing drugs. Since then my mother has done hardcore drugs. The thing about my mother is that she is very kind with her words but will then proceed to do drugs with my siblings or ask them to get them for her even if they've been sober.

She'd preach about how dangerous it was for us to go near the road but then turn around and smoke meth with my brother. My sister overdosed on fentanyl and died this last Thanksgiving day. I had my mom come stay with me for a month because I was alone in another state for work.

She said she regretted it because it was unfair to her boyfriend. So I've finally come to a point where I'm seeing the pattern I learned subconsciously. Which is that she is endlessly affectionate with her words but none of her actions make any sense to me. And I can't get her to confess to any of her wrong doings. She will blatantly lie to my face and boldly deny anything I say even when multiple people confirm the same thing. People I trust.

If I can't trust my own mother, the one woman in the world who is supposed to love me more than any other, then I can't trust any women.

My ex used to be really nice to me. And all I could think was ""what is she using me for now?"" My mom will call me, talk to me for an hour or more about my accomplishments, shower me in compliments and stuff then right before I hang up mention how she needs like $50. I can't express how cynical that makes me. It hurts my fucking soul. I've cried so many times wondering whether or not she actually loves me. I'm crying right now.

I just want my mom to love me. But she isn't capable I guess. Her love is based on convenience and her own gratification. Anytime something in the interest of her kids impeded her own desires she has chosen the latter.

I finally understand why when a woman is really sweet to me I can't take it at face value. Why when a woman wants to be with me I think she's using me. My mother is a black box to me. I don't understand her. The longer I'm around her the less I feel I know her.

I've turned down so many relationships because I was afraid. I feel innately unlovable. I was friends with my ex for 2 years during which we hung out constantly. It took what felt like an eternity to get comfortable with her. And when we did finally date I was always anxious. I constantly needed reassurance. I would randomly be cold towards her because a facial expression she made threw me off or just any red flag I could imagine.

StrangeSuccubus,I can't sleep,1,1c65phj,0,"I can't sleep anymore.

1 f29 broke up with my ex m27 over irreconcilable difference, incompatibility as partners, and overall the way he treated me since he never put any effort into our relationship and the way he dealt with traumas I recieved before the end. 

I was losing myself in being a people pleaser, I got so clingy, and although I didn't see it at the time I was also insecure and using sex as our main form of emotional connection. Before the end he admitted he was purposely trying to get me to hate him so that I would be the one to end it rather than grow some balls and end it himself.  I've been doing fine and I've had growth despite my triggers and being in the same environment as my ex.

 I simply pretend he's a stranger I never met. Recently one of my coworkers decided to ask him what his type of woman, since my ex seems to have a type based on his new girlfriend since she's like me but seems sleazy (since i cant use the other s) and more into makeup but again I don't care. She relayed the information back to me and I didn't want to know, and why did she tell him I was also dating online. 

Since then I haven't been sleeping well. I have recurring dreams where he apologizes, where we have sex, where he's getting married, and where I simply just hear him out except I don't care I'm not interested in getting back with him. My closure is he wanted me to hate him and he said it himself. It's not worth it. I literally want his mother to die and for him to fall down some stairs and to lose everything he cares. I don't care about him but I do have intense hate due to the disrespect that I do bottle and COMPARTMENTALIZE and I never act like I hate him just ignore his presence like he never existed. Other parts of my life that I'm reaching my breaking point on are much more important than this ashhat but it's all my mind wants to dream about and it's lowkey got me sort of dark place where I contemplate  ending my life but don't because it's too much of a hassle I kinda also don't believe it'll solve anything so what's the point.

Later he opened up about this incident to one of his mutual friends who happened to twist what he said  and told everyone that he was making up rumours about A making him feel uncomfortable .

I am still processing everything and finding it hard to come to terms with the mistreatment. I would call her out when fighting that she was being nasty and or/not nice and she would make me apologise for “insulting” her. I have contributed a lot financially for the relationship as she always had an excuse why she couldn’t pay for her own living expenses even though she comes from privilege and has parents that just gives her money to build houses. I helped her so much with all that and when we broke up she changed all the passwords of my accounts that I helped set up for her and us and also asked to check my bags when I left as if I was some kind of thief. 

I can’t believe the way I was treated and I am not sure whether to warn the workers we had together about her as she is trying to take advantage of them and I tried to talk her out of it a few times. Our workers are so kind and I do not want them to be taken advantage of(they are in a third world country and my ex needs them so she can have her houses legally).

i did like him, loved him even. i think i had a crush on him for about 8 months before he started flirting with me. even when he was just flirting, i had feelings for him. but the moment he confessed it was almost like i never liked him in the first place. i told him i wasnt ready to date and  we left it at that for about 3 months ish. we werent dating, but we definitely were not just friends. hed flirt a lot, id try to (i suck at flirting and showing affection). he was waiting for me ""to be ready"", and i thought i would eventually and even tried to gaslight myself into thinking i was.

eventually we started dating, and shit only got worst from there. hed say a lot of demeaning shit, matter of fact hes quite arrogant and egotistical. he thinks so highly of himself and says shit that makes me feel stupid, or at least stupider than him. he told me i was hard to love because im bi, and i had to act as though i ""became straight"". i did all of this just so that i wouldnt hurt his feelings, although i  never considered my own.

LabRatzz,Euthanasia ,1,1c658rz,4,"I will eventually have to euthanize my best friend. He's a cat. He's 11 years old and has end stage renal failure.

Will you guys share your stories and opinions on euthanizing your pets? 

I've done it before with my old lady kitty. She was doing really REALLY bad and had a seizure at the house. The seizure made her go blind. When I took her to the ER they told me everything they thought, and that euthanasia was the best option. I agreed and we went through with it.

The thing that is really tugging at my heart right now is her reaction to the medication. My partner and I sat with her in the room and cuddled her on our laps until the vet came in. They waited until we decided we were ""ready"" and gave her the dosage. What is really messing with me right now is the fact that she tried to run from it. She had been so content with cuddling and petting. She sat still for the needle, but after a few seconds she stood up really fast and tried to run off of our lap, but ended up collapsing and dying.

I think I'm doing the right thing by choosing euthanasia, but I'm so scared. I'm scared of losing my best friend. I'm scared that he's going to be scared and run away from death the way Moxie did.

I have all of these thoughts running through my head. Every human I know that has died wasn't given the option of euthanasia. We keep our human loved ones alive until their body gives up. Why cat my cat talk?! Why can't he just fucking tell me with words when he's ready to go?! I don't want to be put down when I die, I'll die when my body gives up and my heart stops beating. Why can't it be easier? What if, what if, what if? This is the hardest thing I've ever gone through.

We had a pretty rocky 4 years. Probably close to a dozen breakups. But I would always fold and get back with her because I felt bad for her. I would go pick up my stuff from her house, and she would be laying in her bed in the middle of the day in a dark room. I couldn't take seeing her like that.

Our values were completely different. Our hobbies, morals, future prospects, music style, were very different. But we started dating at the dawn of covid, and we didn't have many friends, so we mostly had each other and would spend ALL the time with each other.

I slept over at her house probably over 95% of the time these past 4 years. We saw each other a lot. This is the human being I grew closest to in my entire life.

But now in retrospect I feel like it would've never worked out, and I had every indication of that. And now 4 years have gone by, we are adults, and I can never give her back those years.

I struggle on a daily basis with my feelings for her and my competing feelings for her to want to be happy. She dated a guy who sucked bad, he was unkind and abusive to her and generally a loser.  They finally broke up, which is good news, and now she's back out into the dating scene. 

She was trying to date this guy at a bar that way we both go to and it didn't work out, and now she's talking to a childhood friend of hers who is genuinely one of the most awesome guys I've met in a long time. He's friendly , interesting, handsome. She's into him. I'm not sure yet if he's into her and I think that he would be really good for her. And I'm trying really hard to support her, because I think if she is going to be with someone, he's the kind of guy that I think would be really good for her. 

At the same time, it just it is just so hard for me, because no matter the fact that I'm intellectually aware of the fact that I can probably never have her, I am unable to get over my feelings for her. I'm doing my best to be supportive, and I will do whatever I can to help her get with this man if that's what she wants. But it's also kind of killing me because I still want her so bad. I don't really have anybody I can talk to about this, our mutual friends are already aware of the situation and it's getting to the point where I know they don't really want to hear about it anymore because nothing's going to change, I'm never going to be with her, and that's just the way it is. 

I'm not sure what I'm looking for, I just need to vocalize this. This. I have an appointment to talk to a therapist but that's still a ways down the road and it's very hard to walk around with these feelings. It's very confusing to love somebody as a friend and love them as a romantic interest at the same time and I feel like sometimes I let her down as a friend because of my feelings for her in a romantic way. And it's not fair to her, and I don't want to make her feel like my needs are more important than hers because they're not. I just don't know. It's a tough situation.

Oliveiscrazy, life is falling apart,2,1c61g87,1,"I have nobody to talk to about this, my friends hate me, my boyfriend ignores me, my mom is always preoccupied with pther things, my dad hasn’t texted me in months and my sisters would rather talk to each-other. My life is falling apart. Im falling behind in school,and i never know what we are doing in my classes. My self esteem has plummeted i can barely stand to look at myself in the mirror. I cant sleep. i hate eating (mostly because of celiacs). Im in constant pain somehow but cant do anything about it. I just rot in my room all day/ at school. Almost everyone around me hates me and i don’t know what to do. The only time im genuinely happy is when i am doing ceramics (which i have to have my mom take me but she never wants to) or working because my coworkers genuinely make me laugh and i have fun with them. I think im going insane or atleast manic because nobody seems to get it.

Lacunaethra,His venting made me leave him.,0,1c64w1y,2,"  
I ended the relationship with my last boyfriend due to his constant negativity, which resulted in nothing but relief and happiness for me.

  
He had a lot of good qualities (stable job, no health issues, loyal friends, good support net…), he never treated me badly and overall, our relationship was pretty happy, but after living together for a while, I started to dread the moment he entered the door, already „venting“ about every minor inconvenience of his day. I swear, this guy could whine for MINUTES about bad weather, annoying people, busy roads etc. As if he was the only one in a city of 140.000 people to be bothered by a little rain.

  
I really tried to let him vent in peace (somehow I had the feeling I should be a safe space for him and his negative emotions) and afterwards shift his mind to more positive things (i.e. I talked about positive aspects of my day, encouraging him to do the same), but it didn’t work. He even knew about an old friend of mine, who I broke contact with due to her constant whining and nagging, but he always insisted that it was my duty as a partner to comfort him and I should feel honored that he trusts me enough to share his feelings with me. To me, it became nothing more than an unnecessary burden because there weren’t many options for me – I could either listen in silence and comfort him or I could join his venting session, which I did not want to do. My mental health is very important for me and it benefits me to focus on good things.

  
The thought of ending an otherwise functioning relationship was scary at first, but after the breakup I was SO HAPPY. I come home and there is nobody who drags me down into his own misery. I feel like I lost a burden I did not even realize I was bearing.

throwaway28122812,I need someone to listen,3,1c5yz9z,2,"I(19F) have suffered from anxiety my whole life, I've also been dealing with a really hard battle with depression since I was 14. Even though I know I'm still very young and have my whole life ahead of me I just already feel like I'll never have anything and I just wanted it. I lost touch with my friends after I graduated, I've never had a boyfriend, I want to go to college but can't afford it, I'm overweight,and have been bullied my whole life. 

My whole life has been hard, I grew up with drug addict and neglectful parents, had CPS in my life until I was 10, when I was 8 my mother had to go to rehab as put into foster care for a little bit because no one else in my family wanted to take care of me, but my foster mother abused me just making everything worse. She would yell at me, lock me in my room from the outside so I couldn't get out, and constantly gave me laxatives to try to get me to lose weight. I had been living with my grandmother before but she called my social worker and told them to pick me up cuz she couldn't handle me anymore, but after telling my grandma about how I was being treated by my foster mom, I guess she felt  guilty and took me back. I have ADHD and it was bad as a kid, I think that's why no one wanted to take care of me, they all said I was too much to handle. 

I Have severe self esteem issues. I'm currently trying to lose weight but my depression makes it difficul. I've been ridiculed my whole life about my weight. I remember the first time I've ever felt self conscious,I was visiting my grandmother when I was just 5 years old, I saw this gorgeous model on TV and told my grandma I wanted to be like her, to which my grandmaster said ""you'll never be like that you're too fat"". That really crushed me and those comments from my grandma and everyone else continued. I've suffered from eating disorders which was the only thing I was able to get myself out of on my own. 

my anxiety holds me back so much, it's to the point where I just daydream constantly about a life I wish I had. I think I have maladaptive daydreaming (I think that's what it's called)I'm addicted to daydreaming, it's all I ever do. From the moment I wake up till the moment I go to sleep. I want to go to college to get a music degree and maybe a business degree, I want to be successful, I want to get married and find someone who will love me unconditionally, but I feel like no one will ever love me romantically, being loved unconditionally by someone is the thing I daydream the most about. 


The reason I'm writing this is because I tried to talk to my mom about all of this today but she just told me ""sounds like laziness, you just have to get up and do stuff"". I always have to mentally fight myself everyday to get out of bed and go to work, when I'm not at work I'm literally just in bed all day. I just wanted her to do was ug me and tell me everything would be ok. That's all I've ever wanted from anyone. I want to feel loved and wanted. I can't help but feel like it's to late to fix anything or change anything. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm thinking of trying therapy but I just got a new job and my health insurance doesn't go affective until a few months, that's if I can get therapy with my insurance. Can someone just please help me, give me advice or tell me something, I just want to feel like everything will be okay. ",1713322047.0,
aussielover24,My best friend I drifted away from just unknowingly moved down the street from me,3,1c5yyrx,0,"We were best friends from age 9-19, and spent almost every single day together. We grew up just down the street from the other. We sadly drifted apart during college. She was in a sorority and busy frequently from that, and I was in my first long term relationship of my life (I’m happily still with him) and we just stopped talking every day. I fully admit that I regret pulling away from friendships from being so wrapped up in my relationship and we’ve talked about it since. But I’ve still regretted it for several years now (we’re now 26) and have met up at least once a year since, but it wasn’t the same as before at all. I currently haven’t seen her in about a year because she moved away due to her husband’s job. 

I saw on Instagram today that she’s moving back near our hometown. My SO and I have a house in the town over from where I grew up. I messaged her to congratulate her on buying her first house, and after talking we realized we now live in the same neighborhood, just down the street from each other again! We’re so excited and I just hope we can reconnect and be close, even though I acknowledge it will never be quite the same as it was, but that’s okay, we’re adults now.

Dry_Let4695,I(13F) want to kms.,7,1c5txl1,8,"I know and I’m sorry for posting this because i shouldn’t even be on here for such a young person. But life feels so sucky right now.

My new school has these advanced courses option and I was recommended. Of course I accepted them to make my parents proud, and so I could be more advanced for high school. It all started okay but ever since spring break ended, I cant seem to get on the right track. My friend I’m always paired up with is so efficient, and I hate disappointing her when i’m delaying my finish on a part of a project.

I transferred after 6th grade and I still miss my old school. I wanna go back there, but my mom said it’d be better for me to stay here because all of my friends there distracted me and made me fail, which I was super confused about since I mostly got As and Bs.

Am I not good enough for her? I’ve gotten Bs in elementary, and it seems she’s so disappointed whenever it’s on my grades. We do have a good relationship, but I feel like there constantly pressure for me. I asked her a few times if I could leave the courses if it got too much, but she said “if you want” in a certain tone, which meant she’d be disappointed yet again with how fast I’ve given up. She continued to tell me that just because other people are quitting, doesn’t mean you do too. Which was right, I’m not gonna deny. But I just feel so overwhelmed.

I’ve tried to better myself, and I’m pretty sure half of the influence is because of my phone. I’m tired and want to give myself at least a balanced time, but it’s become an addiction atp.

I want advice please 

p.s: sorry this is sloppy: i couldn’t think straight.

Living here in India is so tough ,the education system has been sucking the life out of me I feel like my life only revolves around writing these exams and getting good grades my parents are no better they only expect the best grades from me no matter what. And after coming into 10th grade it’s just gotten worse. My parents are typical Indian parents so they don’t refrain from physical and verbal abuse. I get beaten and thrashed for the simplest reasons sometimes. And for some context I don’t fit the beauty standard here I have dark skin, small eyes and I’m fat so my extended family paternal side basically bullied me into start wearing a hijab and abaya they said that I should hide my ugliness by wearing it. And I’m the eldest of three kids I have two twin brothers one of them is autistic and don’t get me wrong I don’t hate disabled people or anything but it’s just frustrating to live like this with your parents focusing only on your sibling and showering them with love. And it feels like my life just keeps getting worse as I came into my teens my parents made it clear that I will have to follow their decisions even to fulfill my dreams and that I’m like their lottery ticket to getting out of the middle class status. Because of this I feel like I made a mistake by being a gifted kid I should have just been dumb.Even at school no on really gives a f I don’t even know if I have any real friends to rely on and Indian schools have zero extracurricular activities it’s just sitting and studying. All of this has been taking a toll on my mental health everytime I’m outside near a road I have the urge to jump infront of a car and when I’m at home I want to jump of the balcony or the terrace. I keep on stress eating junk and picking at my skin till it hurts. I pray sometimes that I get an illness and pass away. Because I know after I grow up probably won’t be able to make my parents dreams come true and that no one will love me or marry me because I’m ugly. Right now I’m taking these mock tests which I’m not performin well in I just want to throw my books away and live my life but it’s not possible.And I keep staring at my American cousin’s instagram account I get filled with rage and anger by looking at her enjoy her life with so many friends.

FastProfile6130,I'm going to go below my GPA requirement and lose my stipend and fail out of my PhD and I have literally no backup plans at all. My life is over.,1,1c64lbl,0,"I'm in a math PhD program. I just realized that there is absolutely no way that I get anything other than an F in my PDEs class; this is after dropping algebraic topology last semester. Even if everything else I get this semester is an A (highly unlikely), I'm in all likelihood dropping below the 3.00 required for me to continue my PhD. Even if I'm not kicked out for my GPA, I'll be fucked over on quals.

I had a math major and a CS minor in undergrad. Theoretically, there's a ton of jobs out there that pay well even if academia doesn't work out. Unfortunately, not one of those jobs seem like they'd make me anything other than miserable. I detest coding and probably wouldn't last a week in any tech-related field as a result. I can't ethically work for the NSA or the military industrial complex. The math that goes into all the finance and stock market stuff is exactly the one course that I've fucked up so badly that I'm going to flunk. I'm not even going to leave with a masters. I get that I don't need to love my job, work to live not live to work, etc., but I need to find it tolerable.

My life is essentially over. I will have nothing at all to look forward to if I fail out of my PhD.

Ready_Sign_2955,I have a crush on my best friend of a decade,1,1c64jk7,0,"Hey, so idk what to do but I feel like I need to say something. 

I (20 NB), have been friends with R (21 NB), since we were in grade school. We got really close really quickly and for years we’re basically attached at the hip. I loved spending time with them, and they were the reason I realized I was fruitier than a farmers market. 

We went to different high schools, they did public highschool, and I didn’t do that, so while we didn’t see each other as often, we still were in contact regularly. I could tell you anything and everything about them, and we both have sworn each other to secrecy about some of our embarrassing stories. 

We both started dating people, they dated a piece of shit guy for years and I kinda hopped around in the dating world. When R told me that they were queer I wa so proud of them, but also a bit hopeful? I tried to press that feeling down though, since they were still in a relationship and I didn’t want to throw out so many years of friendship. 

We’ve always acted flirty together, we cosplay couples, act like an old married couple, and many people on the street do often think we’re a couple. When they’re near me I wish it was that way too. We’re both ace, so I don’t want them in a spicy way, but I want to be able to call them my partner, care for them, and tell them how I actually feel. 

We went to a convention a few months ago, and they told me that I was the reason they realized they were queer, and how their bf at the time was scared I was going to steal them away. It’s always been small comments here and there, an occasional flirty text or saying, the comments on photos, small gestures like that: holding hands, pulling each other closer in public spaces, etc. 

Recently we both became single- my bf and I broke up and R and their bf broke it off too. I told them this and they asked if I was serious about the jokes we’ve made in the past about being together, and I said yes. They said we’d talk about it once some time has passed and we got over the broken up sad phase. They said they were serious about it.

Well, I find out that apparently they’ve been talking to someone else and I am happy for them, but there’s also this pang of jealousy and sadness. I know it’s totally unfair and stupid to feel that way but surely they have to see the way I look at them and talk to them…right? They’re their own person and can do whatever they want, and I’ll always be supportive of them, cause at the end of the day I’d rather be friends with them then not have them in my life. 

I seriously wonder if anything they told me was true or if it was some funny joke my autistic ass couldn’t comprehend. To me they taste like coffee and strawberries but to them it seems I taste of nothing. 

I want to tell them everything, like how when I get a message or a call from them everything just seems easier, or how getting to support them and care for them is one of my favorite things to do and I’m just so damn proud of everything they’ve done, how I want to be with them, care for them, call them mine, and treat them so well until they see themself the way I see them. 

I’ll play safe though, keeping my mouth shut, joking and supporting from the side, pretending like this pent up emotions of almost over a decade haven’t been bending the bars of their cage, threatening to escape. It’s easier to do when you’re on the opposite side of the state though.",1713342093.0,

But it was still *a* gauntlet. The front page was loaded with porn - admittedly, it helped distract me from the darker videos. The first was laughable and quite literally a TikTok. Two girls arm wrestled and one managed to break their arm. The next ones quickly ramp up in intensity. A guy crawls out of a burning car. Someone records their own death, failing to escape a trap of their own creation and drowning in their bathtub. A kitten with a missing eye and a botfly larva inside the cavity. A man wedged between a platform and a train. And finally, a video that went on far too long. An elderly man beaten to death by what looks like two young adults by the sides of a train track. The process was brutal and tormenting. His face was first smashed in with a heavy tool of some kind. This left him drowning in his blood, the unsettling sound of his agonal breathing serving as a backdrop to the men's jubilance at his suffering. His abdomen was then stabbed repeatedly with a screwdriver over the course of a couple minutes. They moved onto to stabbing what was left of his face next, finishing him off with a couple swings of a bent hammer to the side of the head.

The worst part about this is that this society has desensitised us to gore so much that I didn't react as strongly as I knew I should have. Instead, I was more disgusted by the two lesbians vomiting over each other after, or the hot iron on some fat man's dick, or the drill bit another man pierced his glans with.

No_Background360,"I lost my dream and what I built for so long, and I can't complain or I'll loose even more.",2,1c60r6f,0,"Sorry this is going to be long, but this is the only place where I can talk about this without being constantly judged. I (18M) graduated from high school last year. I live in a North African country and had the chance to realize my childhood dream: going to college in the U.S. At 15, I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, which made attending classes and making friends much more difficult. My dream seemed increasingly unattainable due to several factors: U.S. healthcare costs, tuition and living expenses, falling grades due to my illness, distance from my family, and my parents' concerns about my health. I was also diagnosed with IgA Vasculitis, which impacted my mobility at times. Despite these challenges, I didn’t lose hope. I considered myself lucky because of my supportive family, the means to study abroad, and the realization that there are people facing even tougher situations than mine.  
I managed to make friends, specifically four close ones, and despite our ups and downs, I hold them dear. I got accepted into a small university in the U.S. After much hesitation, I decided to go. At the beginning of the year, my health was great. I made friends, including Lucas (not his real name), a Japanese international student. We initially clashed over a girl but decided to put that behind us and become friends. I was there for him when his ex-girlfriend betrayed him with lies, leading me to distance myself from our mutual friends who supported her, though they were nice to me. His ex eventually admitted to lying, but I could never forgive them for their actions.  
  
During the second week, I also met a girl from the same country as me, let's call her Clara. Me and Clara spent all days together, we would go to meals, classes, dorms, events and do everything together. One night after it had rained for the first time, we went out to walk. The smell of the trees after rain, the small breeze, and the quiet made that moment kind of unique, we weren't used to this kind of climate so we kept enjoying the moment and didn't talk much. I held her hand to check if they were cold but we kept holding hands until the end of the walk. Neither of us realized it, it felt natural. We then joined our friends at the hall of the dorm. Earlier we planned to watch a movie with everyone, but all the rest of the group canceled. Clara suggested we watch the movie just the two of us as we both really wanted to. We went to her room, started La La Land, we held hands after a couple of minutes, then lay on the bed as the chairs were hard as heck, kept watching the movie for like 10 minutes then we closed the laptop and I kissed her, it was my first kiss, hers too. I will forever cherish this moment. Sorry if it was long I needed to talk about this. After that, we started dating and our relationship was great. We became very serious about each other very quickly, we never had sex as we preserved ourselves, but we would quite often sleep with each other. Life was great until I fell sick, and it was awful this time. She was very supportive and Lucas too, at least at the beginning. But I didn't get better, I missed classes, and couldn't sleep at night due to pain. My sleep schedule got messed up, and I was only able to get some sleep in the morning after being exhausted due to the pain. I also had to ask for a single room, since all the noise I made at night wouldn't let my roommate sleep. But the single room process took a lot of time so I would often just sleep in the common area of the floor. One month later (third month of college) Clara had started getting more and more distant. We would still have very close moments but sometimes she would just disappear. Until one day, my Computer Science professor, decided to make me fail the class (which I felt was unfair but kind of understandable due to absences), I knew this probably meant that I had to suspend my studies. This day Clara told me that I should get my life around and start having a normal student life, and that I should start spending more time with her during the day and be responsible. And I wish I could have been there for her as I know how it felt to go from doing everything together to only being able to see each other in the afternoon and even with that I sometimes were in pain so couldn't see her. But I couldn't. A couple of days later she told me that she doubted her feelings for me, and asked me to just be friends but like without dating anyone else, like a break to give her time. I asked her how much time and she said like a couple of months or even years. This felt completely absurd to me and we decided that we should just be friends. I completely respect that, I know that dating someone sick can be hard. But damn it felt like a stab, especially seeing her emotionless, like she didn't care about all of that. I even asked her and she said ""well life keeps going"" or something like that. I didn't want to break the news to Lucas as we were both his close friends and that would have saddened him. At my great surprise I learned a couple of days later that he knew and when I asked about why he didn't say anything, he told me that he was busy and sad about this. But like at any did he try to comfort me. This made me even more upset knowing how much I supported him when he everyone turned their back on him. He then also became more distant and we kind of stopped talking to each other. The time date for the flight back to my country was getting closer, so I decided to go try to talk to Clara hoping that it was all just a big confusion, but she was even more distant, she told me that she had made a lot of friends and that she was very happy, which reassured me as she was a bit introverted, then she told me that she believes that all what happened was a mistake and that even though we had our moments, it was nothing else than hormones and physical attraction. At the time I wasn't realizing what was happening and believe we had something strong between us. So this broke me. I honestly admit being a bit annoying as I started asking her all of these questions out of disbelief. Looking at this now I understand how this can be a bit stupid as we only spent like 3 months together but I guess I just got really attached. Three weeks later I came back to my country knowing I wasn't going back to the U.S due to my illness. I felt like crap. I lost the closest friends I had and my girlfriend. I don't know why but at the time I felt guilty, I convinced myself that I should have just withstood the pain and keep being there for them. After a couple of weeks my friend Rayan came back from the U.K and he also had to drop out of his school but because he didn't like what he was doing. But I didn't know that, when he came back we called each other and I started teasing him about how he pulled up a baddie and that it wasn't expected because he never talked about girls with us. I don't know why but he got mad all of a sudden and said that I was a fake friend for saying that he didn't deserve her ??? (I didn't say that) And after 30 minutes of constant texting to try and reason with him, he called me back and apologized and said that he was stressed due to his problem at school. After that we met with everyone and had a fun time. But when I was asked what happened with my ex and I told them. They were kind of supportive but told me to move on because we only spent 3 months together and that was nothing. I didn't tell them about the rest about my sickness and the real reason why I stopped my studies there and I could never complain. They would sometimes make jokes about all of this and I would get upset but they tell me to stop being sensitive. They aren't bad friends it's just that don't realize the situation I guess. So I never was able to talk with them about this. As for my parents they put so much effort and money into this that I could never bother them with these stupid things. Today it felt particularly hard to keep for me so I decided to get this off my chest. I am currently applying to universities again but not in the US. Recently I sent a message to Clara to wish her Happy Birthday, she transferred to a better University as we were planning. I am happy for her. I am doing a bit better with my health.

Emergency_Boring,scared of dying young,2,1c601dr,1,"Every time I'm left alone with my thoughts, I get this intense feeling I'm going to die young.  


I don't believe in ""spiritual"" intuitions much, but yet I'm so scared that maybe it's true. I know I'm only simply thinking this way because I have a fear of death, but I still can't get over this feeling. I have a lot of dreams, and I'm a hard worker, the last thing I want is to die. And sometimes I become afraid the more lucky I get, the closer to death I get. It's pretty ridiculous that I've started thinking coincidences are screaming, ""you're gonna die soon."" now.   


As I was working, my playlist was playing, it's about 7 hours long, and was on shuffle. Meanwhile work, the thought of dying young was getting louder and louder, and as soon as it reached its quick peak, Live Every Second by Tokio Hotel began playing when I had thought of a comment I seen a few days ago giving advice to help this fear; which read along the lines; ""You're thinking this way because you haven't lived enough, live every second."" Even as I write this, more things are making everything about death. My dog crawled on me and poked his nails through my shirt; somehow this made me think it was about death, it's a sign I'm dying young.  


I can't stop thinking this way, I don't want to go out young",1713325323.0,

Context: I’m almost 30f and have never been in a relationship. 

Just now saw a tiktok of a woman in her 40’s sayings she’s never been in a romantic relationship and (nothing against her) made me promise myself I would rather not continue being alive that be single forever. 

I’m just so incredibly tired of seeing my friends go on with their life’s, getting married, having children, and me being stuck here not even going out on dates. 
I’m just not attractive I guess? Maybe something physical, or my demeanour? Idk honestly. I’m just 100% sure I won’t get to be 40 and single.  ",1713338801.0,
thecreambiscuit,My boyfriend of 3 years started dating someone else ,0,1c63p13,2,"I (26F) was dating my best friend (28M) for three years and we broke up at the beginning of this month as it was a little toxic and he didn’t want to put in effort to change. 
Two weekends ago, he called me up and told me that he wants to get back and I did not say no because I obviously love this guy a lot, but I did tell him that I needed some time. He started saying things like “I’m going to download bumble and see other people if you’re not with me” (he has used this line in the past to manipulate me) I got very pissed this time and I told him that this is not how someone who likes another person behaves and I again asked him to just give me some time to get my thoughts straight. I went out that Saturday night and I met a friend of my ex’s (let’s call him Y) and we started talking. I live in a small city and I never found anyone who was interested in the same things that I was (I love reading and I read a lot of genres & so does Y) , Y & I ended up talking majority of the night. 
My ex’s friends hate me because they’re toxic masochists and I never had any problem in calling them out (one of his friends misbehaved with me twice and my ex did not do anything about it)
So, these people went ahead and told my ex that I slept with Y. My ex called me up the next day and accused me of cheating and said he never wants to talk to me again. This really broke my heart as he did not bother to ask me about what had actually happened there. There was nothing sexual /inappropriate between Y and me. 
I waited for 10 days and I called my ex two days ago and he tells me that he’s met someone else and he’s in love. He told me that he met her the day he found out that I slept with Y and he went out with her on a lot of dates since and that he’s fallen for this new girl. 
I have no idea what to think. I have barely processed this information and I’ve been getting random anxiety attacks since this happened. I’m trying to divert myself and move on but it’s so so hard as he was my best friend and we used to talk so much and now there’s zero contact. I still love this guy but I cannot forgive him for what he’s done to me. 
I don’t know what to do.

In my own head, I am a bad person, no matter how much good I do, I’m still the same guy that I started as. 
When I was young, I was in a frustrating household. My stepdad just yelled at me and treated me like a dog, so what I got was extensional dread of death, and a long desire to be gone. 
That turned into a seven year old me, in a bathtub, trying my hardest to drown. But due to human instinct and fear, and an undying desire to not die a virgin (I have no clue why this was one of my priorities as a 7 year old) I am still here, and alive. 
Now, almost 13 years later, I’m thinking the same thing. I understand that my actions, as regretful as they might be to me, ultimately shaped me to the man I am today
Even still, most of the problems in the lives of the people around me, I feel, would be solved if I was never in them to begin with. 
I feel like the only thing I’m good at is ruining things and causing trouble. 
I know none of this is true, at all, but when I get my ass roasted by my all of my friends and I try to defend myself when they’ve invalidated my words and thoughts and drive, I always go back to feeling like shit and drowning in self pity.

Never ever felt like I fit in the city where I grew up. I found another part of the country that I thought would be better. Spent 12 years there. Really, really tried to be a part of the community; make friends, date, volunteered for groups and causes. I think I made a true faith effort to be apart of the community.

Every holiday, most every birthday I was always alone. Never got any traction in my new city. Came so close to end it all. I would look at the neighbour’s Christmas tree through their window and cry. Nobody ever invited me to their home for the holidays. I just got to see glimpses of it from a far.

I finally had enough and despite huge hardships I am returning to my home country. To hell with this shit hole.

AcanthopterygiiDense,I’m really tired of feeling like I have to constantly compete with others!,1,1c63cuf,0,"For context: I am 18 years old and an artist. I do mostly character art, and post said art stuff online. I made quite a few online friends who I adore talking to but I noticed this feeling of constantly feeling like I have to compete with them….

An example is this Vampire Alternate Universe story I’m writing with a friend that stars our characters. It’s quite an unoriginal idea which is why I’m not shocked that a DIFFERENT online friend is doing a similar thing (lesbians and vampires, a winning combo).

I wish I can say that I’m only happy for them but the truth is that I feel threatened. It’s a stupid feeling and I know that I have no reason to be feeling this way but I am.

I feel like i have to be different in every way possible so that i can be “good enough”. Like why have two of the same thing when one is obviously better? If theirs is better: then why the fuck am I even doing this? Am I not just clogging up the artistic space? So then I get upset at them. I feel like I’ve been taken advantage of because here was a thing I was so happy to do but now I have to compete with them! 

But I know this isn’t fair. They don’t deserve it, and that’s why I don’t tell them. Actually I usually just mask my feelings while talking to them until we stop.

The problem is, that I don’t have a single problem with her, she is very pretty and personality wise I’m not sure that there are negative sides.

Today I made an apt based on a price they told me over the phone. Moved everything around to get there in a few hours and it was a big pain … BIG .. but got there. right as I got there they called and they said the person on the phone was new and messed up and the price was radically different. I said ok is there anything we can do to remedy it? I went really out of my way for this and was just met with total no. Like honestly like an “I’m sorry here’s a 10% off next visit” or something dumb would have done the trick idk.  
I went inside to just talk face to face since I was there already and usually face to face is always better but it was so awkward. As soon as I walked in all the employees were staring at me which put me a bit on the defensive.  I didn’t yell or anything like that but when discussing it I wasn’t super polite. I definitely came across frustrated.  I just ended up leaving, and then calling back to apologize for and “Karen like” behavior since as soon as I got some distance I felt like an idiot. Stuff happens and even if I disagree with them it’s no reason to act not polite.

meanmommy101,I am torn on how to tell my mom that she has a 1/2 sister from her recently passed father.,4,1c5vs91,0,"I am sorry this is a bit long. Backstory, I have never known my birth father. I recently did an ancestry DNA test. When I checked the DNA matches, I matched with a person I obviously didn’t know. When I investigated further it said they were on my maternal side. The predicted relationship was first cousin. I know everyone on my mom’s side and had never heard of this person. I also know that no one else has either. Mainly because they all love to gossip like it is their life’s mission to inform everyone about everything. It is well known that if you want something to get back to someone just tell one of my family members. Family in other countries will know everything inside of 4 hours. 

I have had the exact same results with others and they were known to be my maternal aunts so I was instantly shocked at the implications. I clicked on the profile and they clearly stated they were looking for their birth father with the same name as my maternal grandfather!!

I dug and found out (through the person’s FB and birthday information) that my grandfather cheated on my grandmother while on a ship assignment away from my grandmother and their first child. The affair was with a civilian (AP) at the base where his ship was. I compared photos of the new family member and myself as well as my grandfather and we have facial similarities that are identical. I know this is not uncommon but coupled with the DNA I knew they were related. 

I talked to the person last week about it and they were able to confirm we were talking about the right person (grandpa) as details were correct with what we have always known about my grandfather. Furthermore, he was there at this person’s birth and until they were about 1-2 and were walking (photo evidence). Their mother knew about grandpa’s oldest child (the rest were not born until a couple years later) but I don’t know if the AP knew he was still married. The new family member seems really sweet and has a similar lifestyle to myself and my mom. I also did a crime check with their name in their state to make sure they were good. There was nothing. 

My issue is I know I have to tell my mom but I am so worried about her. Her known siblings are, for lack of a better (less offensive) word, trash.

I love my mother and she has been through so much. I don’t want to be the one to tell her, but it would not be right to hide this from her. I can’t take the choice away from her.

No romance or sexual experiences, no travel, no friends, no work, diagnosed with hormone disorder that makes me fat, lost my home, lost pets, and so on.

Lonely_Actuator4027,I broke up with a married man and i feel sad,2,1c5yg9t,1,"It started at work. He’s an overseas customer and he commented on how beautiful i am.  Im not considered beautiful in usa, so i fell in love with him. I’m not used to men complimenting me. I loved the attention. He was very caring and took us around sightseeing.  We started chatting everyday after i left, not a day would go by before we texted good morning or good night to each other.  

In the back of my mind i always felt guilty because he was married, but he said not to worry.  He also didn’t mean to fall in love with me.  But because it feels true to not feel bad.

I rationalized and rationalized and then flew out of country to see him again.  We became intimate, kissed and hugged and then i flew back, but then his wife and kids moved back to live with him after living apart for 5 months.  I couldn’t text him freely & my full conscience yelled at me and said what are you doing?? Why are you disrespecting her his wife? I listened to Beyoncés song Jolene.. and i felt so guilty

So i broke up with him over text.  He told me he’s heartbroken, and I also took off work today.  I want to go back to him.. so badly. He said he has so much pain in his heart.

I never wanted to date a married man.  I’ve never been asked out on a date in usa. I’m 40 single female and never been in a relationship… my mother is schizophrenic and my father yells at me disrespects me…i long to have love.   and then i go and meet and fall in love with this sweet but married man.

I require some care myself, can’t live alone, and am not even close to financially stable.

I always thought I’d be a mom to at least one child. From the time I was a kid myself I was *certain* of it. I was 10 years old reading parenting magazines to prepare. When I was a teen I thought of writing a bundle of letters to give my baby when they turned 18. I am glad now I didn’t. 

I’m officially in my late 30s and it’s becoming a now or never situation. I’ve had to choose never. It just wouldn’t be right. With different circumstances I almost certainly would be a mother.

shinjithrowaway618,I miss my friend,1,1c62fhg,1,"I became close with someone a little over a year ago (let's call him J). We'd see each other a couple times a week, be texting, sending memes and venting to each other. I had a small crush on him for the first couple of months of our friendship, which he was well aware of, and I'd ask one of my other friends (let's call him B) for advice. B had been trying to sleep with me for the months I liked J. 

I'd become incredibly close to this group, hanging out at their houses, smoking, drinking - they were responsible for me going out of my comfort zone and developing in a way I hadn't before. We'd hang out at least once a week and it was a real refuge from some of my other uni friends, who I was trying to distance myself from. 

J would flirt with me a couple of times, especially when drunk or high, but I was always too scared to reciprocate, since I kind of knew he didn't really like me that way. 

Throughout the year I grew more distant from the two (B practically wanted nothing to do with me when he realised I wouldn't sleep with him) and I got the sense that they both didn't want me around when other girls came into the picture. One girl that J liked and had a situationship with, B was flirting with a month after they started fooling around with each other. 

7 months into the established friend group, there was a small gathering. It was apparent that B was going to sleep with J's ex-situationship and J was asking the both of them to do a threesome. When they both told him to fuck off, J started going to kiss me for most of the night. 

For context, for four years prior I thought I was asexual. I had a boyfriend before that point but all we had done was peck. I am also on the austism spectrum and it takes me a little while to learn the social cues that everyone else seems to know.J knew I had little to no experience (despite being 20 at the time), that I used to like him and that I was on the spectrum. 

His best friend asked if I was okay that night (he also knew about my past feelings) and his ex-situationship asked the same thing and wanted to make sure I didn't feel used. 

After that night, I got my hopes up. I thought a part of him liked me the way I did all those months ago. He said he'd do it all again on text. When I came to talk to him about that night, kind of making sure he was okay and wanting to get to the bottom of why he would take one of my first kisses from me, he walked out and said there was nothing to talk about. He kept mentioning that he kissed another girl who was there (but he kept going for me the whole night and even tried to take the pecking a little further, the furthest I'd ever gone with anyone). 

I felt quite hurt after that. I knew deep down that he was using me to console himself about his ex-situationship (who he was still not over) having sex with one of his best friends. We had been growing more distant and the fact he could just use me like that and give me no explanation and walk out of the room sort of proved that he didn't value me. I didn't want to have contact with any of those people after that. 

I (F20 at the time) gave J (M20) the silent treatment, despite him being nice to me over text that day. I didn't like his messages until 4 days later to show him i was hurt. I was given advice ""don't tell him how your hurt, show him with your actions"". He didn't seem to care. If i had to do it all over, I don't know if I would. It seemed really emotionally immature of me to do that instead of just telling him to not do that to me again, even though I know he probably didn't like or respect me at that point. 

He went overseas in that month, which was the month I started taking antidepressants and started seeing my current boyfriend. If J hadn't kissed me that night, I wouldn't have been brave enough to kiss my boyfriend at another party, which lead to the best months of that year.

When I saw J a month later, everything came back to me: how shitty I felt when I hung out with his group, how he made me cry, how attractive I used to find him and the fear it might have taken away from the attraction of my boyfriend (who I was just friends with at the time but was pursuing), how I had told other people what happened and things could be a whole lot more difficult now. I had a panic attack right in front of him and tried to hide it. He definitely noticed and left with his friend. 

That was the last time I spoke to him. Now we both can't be a room together or one of us will go the other way (he also has really bad anxiety). A mutual friend decided to meddle, trying to get close to him to find out information while trying to get me to talk shit about him (before telling him). I got drunk one night and said some quite mean things about him (after the mutual friend kept pestering me to say something about him), which I'm guessing that mutual ""friend"" told him about because he unfollowed me on insta the next day. 

I hoped that the two of us could have reconnected eventually and that I could introduce him to my boyfriend, who I can imagine him really getting along with. When he unfollowed me, I knew that it was over and that I could never be friends with this person, whom I used to be very close with. 

I'm grateful for his recklessness that night instilling the recklessness in me to kiss my now current boyfriend randomly at a party. If we didn't have minimal communication during the month he was away and if I didn't ghost him for the week after hurt my feelings, I don't know if I would be with the best person I know. But I part of me can't help but mourn our lost friendship and wish I didn't feel sick every time I walked into a room with J in it. 

To top it all off, despite B having sex with J's ex-situationship, they're still good friends. I know they're just guys on the prowl but it still makes me wonder if I did something wrong with my actions or whether I was always bound to not be friends with them because I was a woman. I'm totally grossed out by B's behaviour towards women and disappointed to see J morph from a sensitive dork, into a dick who only cares about looking cool.

Dibs_Dubs_Dums,I’m tired of struggling and fighting for everything in life. ,2,1c5y5kz,0,"I wasn’t a smart kid at school and a shy guy so often got bullied. But not being smart isn’t an option in India, so fought hard and spent 12-14 hours studying everyday during middle school to catch up and get good scores. I thought my struggle would end once I got into a good high school. High school demanded even more studying to get into a good engineering college, so had to fight and study for another 14-15 hours every day to beat the competition and get good grades. 

Engineering was a bit better, less stressful and I enjoyed the subjects but had to travel 4hours everyday. 

Then I realized pay was shit in India. So had to study again, take a huge gamble and huge debt to come to US without any backing. Thought getting to US would be the hardest part. Spent the next 2 years living in a living room in Iowa, figuring out everything on my own, studying till 3-4AM to catch up with US education and living on mere $1000 monthly pay. Spent 2 years applying to over 2000 jobs but companies don’t hire immigrants students easily and so won’t even call. Left everything in Iowa and moved to California to improve my chances. Finally got 2 interviews and cleared one at Microsoft. Thought the struggle and hard work paid off as I was now earning decent pay. But the struggle continued to get promoted. Had to spend long hours to catch up with smart people and get promoted and maintain career trajectory. This would be a life long struggle I guess. 

With a good job, I thought I would now be attractive enough to get beautiful dates and could afford a good meal. But realized Indian boys are the least preferred men for relationships. So the struggle continued to make myself fit and attractive and understand how to get a date and behave in a relationship. After uncountable swipes, meetups, events found one girl I liked. Did many things for her but she was in a hurry to get married and she got married in 3 months. 

The struggle continued. I couldn’t stay at the old place due to memories so moved to a different place and restart. Found another girl, she wasn’t perfect but committed and good at heart and life was happy finally. But Indian marriage demand approval from parents and factors like caste, astrological match, her personal issues became a major problem for my parents demanding me to break up. So the struggle continues. 

During all this moving (8 times in 7years), I also lost all my friends multiple times to a point where I won’t have anyone to talk to for weeks. So a constant struggle was to find friends but never could find people who weren’t friends just when they needed something. 

That brings us to today. I understand I need to keep fighting but Im tired of fighting for everything. I still need to fight to get a good wife, then fight for green card so that I can take care of my parents in their old age, fight to keep growing in career to afford house and decent life for my kids, fight to provide for their education and fight to make a name for myself or do something meaningful with my life. If I lose any of these battles I’ll have to give up everything, go back to India and all my efforts go worthless. 

I’m tired of fighting and struggling for everything and just wish something would come easy or I would be lucky. I’m tired of fighting alone without any support or help. 
Been doubting the point of all this struggle. Just don’t know why Im fighting anymore.

Borderedge,I found a job. I finally won't risk homelessness ,14,1c5jkz7,1,"As per title. I received a job offer today which I accepted in 10 minutes without asking for working times or how many vacation days I shall have this year. I also won't know my exact team but I really really needed to work in my field.

I lost my job at the beginning of the year due to a recession, a crisis in my field and my former employer not believing in me. With that, due to bureaucracy, I lost my health insurance. I got it back yesterday... I couldn't go to the doctor and to the hospital for two months and a half. I will really need therapy. I have a slight mental health issue and the breakup plus these life events all at once are worsening it.

In all of this, after less than two months where I applied for unemployment, went to 6 job fairs and took care of the bureaucracy for my car as I live abroad, my ex dumped me on my birthday. A week after, she ran away in the middle of the night to a female colleague of hers. I've only seen and heard from her when she picked up her stuff, surrounded by several other colleagues (8).

As she moved out, due to the rental contract, I also needed to move out. However, my unemployment is below minimum wage... Which would mean social housing or homelessness. I had to ask all of my neighbours to tell the landlord she's still here in order to not be evicted. Oh and in all of this I have a thesis to finish. Plus I have the rent and bills to pay on my own while she has a full-time contract.

I'm posting here as I'm scared she'll cancel the rental on her side (she took all of her stuff but she still has the keys) and I won't have a place where to stay.

It's been the lowest point in my life. I found a new good friend, reconnected with my ex who was actually pretty supportive and can now have a positive outlook on life.

theseboysofmine,So I just lost my job. Lol,2,1c5xz6o,2,"So I got into work today and was suddenly fired for ""stealing"" . Wait until my employer learns that we all ""steal"". Why the quotations you may ask. So I previously worked at a restaurant that tip shared. And when I'm in previously I mean 2 hours ago. For the past two years with this tip shareing I have continuously made over 20% in tips closer to 30% and tips because I am damn good at my job. In other words I will be doing 500 to $600 and tips every night that I work, and leaving with only 200 o $300.Every once in awhile a customer will tip on my machine the 20% and then give me cash and tell me to keep the cash that is fine. So another words the restaurant is getting the 20% for the tip pool and I'm getting a little extra on the side. In every other single situation including getting $100 bills handed to me multiple times have I put those in the tip share. In this situation I had a $70 check. They tips 20% on that check,  having a $40 in cash, and telling me to keep it. I kept $20 of the $40 and put the rest into the tip pool, more than 20%, closer to 50% to the tip pool from that table. Today I got fired for stealing because of that specific situation. Now this is the first time I've done it two years of working there. Have been told by multiple of the staff so that is what you are supposed to do. As long as the house is payed 20% into the pool the rest is yours if it is cash. Knowing that I also know that most of the staff of this restaurant do that. But apparently they have never been stupid enough, like myself, to be honest to some of their fellow staff. I felt weird about taking my first $20 from the tip pool. And I let two different members of staff know, and asked how they felt about it. One of those numbers said that that seemed dishonest so I told them that that's the only time I'm ever going to do that cuz I kind of feel a little dishonest about it too. And my stomach squirmed, you know? Previous to this I have also told another new staff member that is what we regularly do when we get more than a 20% tip in cash. So of course I had let them know today that I was let go for that, and don't they dare tell anybody that I told them that they can do that or that they'd ever done done it because I don't want them to lose their job as well. And if anybody does approach them about it then have them blame me. Because I'm obviously the one who said that that was okay to them. Not that I blamed the 5 to 10 other people who told me that that was okay previously. Because they still have their jobs there. And I don't want to cause them any trouble. But my goodness if my boss only knew that that was the regular he wouldn't have a staff anymore. And my goodness I have so many pictures of health code violations and issues within that restaurant and I am so ready to take them to someone official right now. However I do know that in other person who once upon a time was fired and then reported health code violations just ended up getting in legal trouble with the company. So I don't know what to do but God damn do I wish I could get back at them right now. I am angry. I'm jaded. I just cut my hair into a mohawk last week so that's going to make getting a job a lot harder. They could have fired me before I did that, that would have been great. And my boss as he was firing me told me that he would give me a good recommendation because he likes me. I am feeling all sorts of different ways right now. I also sort of feel like I should have posted this on Am I the a******. Because I really want to know if I am the a****** here. Like I know that I'm at just an a****** in general.

She said yes but whenever we were a little closer (she lives an hour and a half away) however for that month and a half we have talked everyday, been on the phone for 9 hours, and even are mutuals on multiple social media platforms. As you’d imagine we talked about some personal stuff in our lives that we have only told a small handful of people and we’ve gotten pretty close.

 So you’d think it’s going well so far right? Well lately shes been making no effort to communicate. No good morning/night text (unless I initiate it first), being left of delivered for hours, and even her going as far as asking to call because she “missed my voice” and then proceeding to leave me on delivered for 15 hours because she fell asleep. And when she would text back after hours of no response it would either be a one word response or just a “hey sorry I was asleep” all of this out of nowhere too.


What confuses me is that throughout all this she still continues to compliment and flirt with me. She would go from one word responses to being extremely bold. I don’t want to ask her about it because I don’t want to make it seem like I’m desperate or insecure.

So I (20m) recently accepted that I’m bi but I’m also pretty religious so I thought to myself that it’s okay to have these feelings as long as I don’t act on them.

Well last night, a friend (m) I was attracted to asked if he could come over since we haven’t seen each other in awhile and obviously I said yes. We started cuddling (which we have done before) and things gradually got more intimate. 

Before I knew it he asked if he could feel my dick and my heart started pounding. I said yes and he played with it until it got hard then he asked if he could suck it and I let him. 

While that was happening I had very intense feelings of fear, pleasure, shame, and joy at the same time and I had him stop because I didn’t know if I wanted to go all the way through with this.

We stopped then we grinded on each other and made out a little bit and then I talked to him about my situation with my sexuality and religion conflicting with each other and he told me to not worry about it and encouraged me to experiment  with other guys (he even knows a few he could set me up with). I told him I’ll think about it and that was the whole interaction.

I haven’t been able to think about anything else since that happened. I feel so ashamed of it but it just felt so good and can’t help but crave for more. I was hoping to save my virginity for the girl I would marry but now it’s so tempting to lose it sooner. I just don’t know how to feel about all of this and not sure what to do now.

He dmed me at 1:30 am, saying he couldnt sleep. I would have usually responded to him in a heartbeat if I was awake. I didnt though. I thought if I did respond, they would know I broke the promise. I put myself before them. It gets worse though;

The way I confessed to this to them was barely even a conscious desition. It was during our nightly call session, a time where we where supposed to talk about chill things, not fucking confess to the things we feel guilty about. They left the call almost instantly.

They said they couldnt trust me as much now, though they wanted to. They said they weren't trying to hurt me but that they where upset with me. And also [it gets worse, still...]

i admittedly have really bad anxiety and relationship insecurities, mostly due to bad past relationships. my last relationship lasted for a little over 2 years and the guy was awful, he was emotionally and verbally abusive, would always threaten me. he was a pathological liar as well, lied about being an ex-heroin addict, lied about abuse, etc etc. he lied about the majority of his life, honestly. he left me with some really bad issues, he cheated on me for the last couple months of our relationship and gaslighted me for those months even though i knew, i just let him walk over me. 

after i ended our relationship, i went to hinge and tinder. i was mostly seeking hookups, i was in a really bad state of mind. i felt so numb and like i had been stripped of any emotion after all those years of abuse and me trying for this guy who ended up cheating on me and telling me that i was weak, horrible, and would tell me to off myself. i just… at the time wanted to fill a sexual void. after around three months on both apps, my amazing boyfriend liked me.

we had actually went to high school together and were in similar circles which is originally why i liked him back. one thing led to another and we started talking, hanging out a lot, hooking up, but it went way past that. he listens to me and i listen to him, he gave me a safe space to express myself without judgement and understood i was still grieving over the abusive situation i had just escaped. he understood i was distrustful for a good reason and told me he would wait for me until i was ready, and he did. it took around 7-8 months, but eventually he built a home for me that i feel safe in. i barely think about what my ex did to me anymore and all the things he put me through, faking an addiction just to draw attention away from the actual addiction i had been experiencing myself at that time, among so many other fucked up things he told me and lied about just to elicit a reaction. 

i asked him out eventually, it was very romantic and nice. i treated him the whole day, i just want to make him as happy as he makes me. 

the issue is though, every moment i spend with him, i feel like an awful boyfriend. im admittedly.. still healing. i feel like a shell of the person i used to be, not just because of my ex. my entire life was kind of a shitshow, i experienced all types of abuse when i was younger and as a result had a tough time integrating with my peers. many of my partners have cheated on me, i had a stalker for 2 years, and immediately in this situation i also had my ex who ive been describing. i feel emotionally ran through, mostly numb consistently, and like i dont do enough emotionally for my bf.

i try to make sure to have appropriate reactions to things, but i just dont know how to be genuinely excited anymore. he makes me so happy but every nice thing he does, and every little thing i think i fuck up on, my mind convinces me more hes gonna leave. or like he’ll be like everyone before him. hes pretty, hes smart, hes creative and talented. i know he has many admirers, some of which who i feel like have so much more on me. hes looking for a new job right now and im so anxious because my most recent ex had been cheating on me with a co worker. i feel like i cant let myself completely open up to my bf because of these fears, im scared to let people in now out of fear that they’ll just leave one day, but i still want to make him happy and enjoy whatever time we have before he might leave.

idk, i just feel awful most of the time and its a thought in the back of my mind.

stoopid_bean,Nightly routine of being scared of death,1,1c61r4n,0,"I've recently gotten back into ADHD meds after awhile and i think it's been contributing to my anxiety and panic attacks. Every night a lay down and thing about how I'm going to die one day for the past week until I cry and panic, I can't sleep and I feel drained everyday from a lack of it.

I keep laying down to sleep and it feels like I just get a stream of horrible thoughts going through my head unwillingly, and I keep having this image in my mind of looking at my body or arms and legs and my skin aging overtime and then watching my body rot. I'm scared of rotting for some reason once I die and I keep letting the thought of ""I'm actually going to die one day and there's nothing I can do to stop it"" overpower my brain. I'm scared of death, I'm scared of how I could die, I want to stay young forever and I feel like everything is good right now but once I get older I'll look back at these moments and wish I didn't do the things I'm doing now.

I don't want to regret anything and I don't want to die unhappy, but I know I'm going to be unhappy dying anyways. And what if I live another life and suffer a horrible death? What if I get murdered or harmed by someone else? Its so scary and I don't know how to make these thoughts stop. I haven't had any thoughts like this for forever until I took my ADHD meds as of recently. I also haven't been able to eat, have been angry at everything and irritable, paranoid of my surroundings and overly emotional in general. I just want comfort, but I don't know how this could get any better.",1713331080.0,
,I feel sad,1,1c61omk,0,"I feel sad. 

I know why. It’s because i feel like my relationship is just one of convenience. I study for school, he works and plays video games while i study. Easy right? But i want more from it. 

I love him, but sometimes i feel like it’s one way. I feel invisible at times. He says he loves me, hell, i even believe it at times. But there is always another part of me that is questioning. I chalk it up to my own mental instability, but in my heart i feel like the signs are there. 

Since the summer it had actually gotten alot better. I had a conversation with him about the importance of communication, about wanting to feel wanted beyond our weekly phone calls. But at times, i am not sure how well i fit into his life. His life is so full with family and friends, i feel like there is no room for me. I know this is irrational as he does make time for me. But when we are together, it’s as if i am still fighting for his attention. I have brought this up to him, and he has apologized over and over, telling me he is going to do better. And for over two years I believed him. But if that’s the case then why do i still feel this way? Maybe i am in a negative space of mind. 

It’s not all bad. Actually i find myself laughing alot with him on good days. And there are alot of good days. But when there are bad days, they hit really hard. 

I know i am spiraling, and i will be okay. I think i wrote this out to get it off my chest and hopefully it will help.

i lost my car due to an accident (that wasn’t my fault) the other person’s insurance company is basically giving me the runaround and i don’t have a car or the money yet to buy a new car. 

i’ve been ubering and calling my friends for favors (paid rides) and with everything in price going up i’m left with almost nothing after bills, rent, ride $, and groceries. 

so my husband thought it was a good idea to ask his mother (my mil) if we can borrow one of her cars that she doesn’t use at all. she ultimately decided she would, in her own words take it as long as you need. and give it back when you get your money or car. 

not even 7 days and she’s already called my husband to tell me to return the car cause i would most likely wreck it. 

i wasn’t in the conversation but according to my husband he’s defending me and is now upset with his mother for berating me and going back on her word.

I am talking more along the lines like seizures or Tourette’s. And some religious people even believe in demonic possession. God literally “promises” humans have free will, but also allows evil demonic spirits to possess them and control them, complete violation and contradiction of freewill.

Both mental/neurological illnesses and spiritual beings completely go against the entire concept of freewill and self control.

I have literally woken up terrified running down the hall and barking like a dog and swinging my arms around, and it only stopped after calling out to God, yet I still struggle to believe in God, and very much hesitate to submit to a higher powers plan and will instead of my own desires in life.

I don’t know how most people go through life always in control of themselves, not “glitching”, just behaving and acting normally.

Schizophrenia and psychosis also seems to debunk this entire notion of self control and freewill, but even normal human psychology contradicts it.

Why do humans glitch and make bad decisions? Why does anyone choose one action or behavior over another? What makes them choose to do one thing instead of another?

People are punished for having panic attacks, police will yell at people who are having a complete nervous/mental breakdown psychosis and throw them on the ground for being terrified for their life and trying to run away because they think they’re demons and/or the devil from Hell trying to take their soul there, or terrorists, or even fake police (actually proven to be real).

Self control and freewill are LIES, even the Bible and God completely contradict these concepts.

All we are is chemicals reacting in sometimes strange and random ways. Psychology is too complex to boil down to this silly “free will/self control” nonsense. Or maybe even spirits controlling us, or another entity controlling us in a simulation or something like that.

I am so many steps ahead most people, I am onto the forces beyond, how could they not be coming after me? Maybe they just want to watch me ostracized and seen as crazy.

Why can’t more people wake up?

They’re not just going to control me anymore, I’m at least going to be suspicious about and resist it with stubbornness.

I am disobeying higher powers beyond us by NOT disobeying the law. Obeying the law and societal standards is obviously disobeying God, or whatever lay beyond.

Sometimes I even think it might be a sin to NOT obey Satan, I think God might actually want me to worship the devil and serve and obey him. God is “beyond our understanding” and “works in mysterious ways” right?

Or maybe God just wants us to resist and I’m passing His twisted tests.

I’m not supposed to know all this.

They were telling me to attack people and bite their skin off one day, after one of the worst nightmares and terror and derealization I had ever had in my entire life. I thought demons were attacking me.

But I RESISTED, I managed to not let them overtake and control me. They WILL not use me for their evil agenda!

I WILL resist being overtaken by evil, I WILL fight as hard as I can to be a good person, even if I’m still going to Hell and burning in the Lake of Fire. Even if God rejects me, I shall do good anyway. After all, we shouldn’t do good only for rewards, right?

Whole-Occasion-1774,My girlfriend coerced me into sex the other night.,715,1c4rryo,188,"We've been together about a year and 2 months now.

Last week Friday night, I (23M) came home very drunk after going out to celebrate a personal milestone and my girlfriend (23F) came to my place shortly after. She decided to drink a bit while we hung out in my bedroom and at this point I was starting to black out. I don't know how much time passed because I was fading in and out of consciousness but at some point she was on top of me, making out with me, grabbing my genitals while telling me how horny she was and how much she wanted me.

At some point I remember clearly saying that I didn't want sex, and she said okay, but kept doing everything she could to turn me on and kept grabbing my genitals and pushing me to have sex with her and telling me how much she wanted me inside her. She wouldn't stop, even when I'd try and push her away she wouldn't stop. Even when I tried telling her I didn't want to do these things through my slurred words, she just wouldn't stop pushing me to have sex with her, all the while repeating over and over how much she wanted me. During this time she also started talking about how she felt I didn't love her anymore and that maybe I was in love with someone else etc.

At some point I realised she wouldn't stop, that it didn't matter if I could barely form words let alone properly consent to anything she was doing, that she wanted satisfaction regardless of whatever I'd tell her, that all the times I told her I didn't want to have sex didn't matter to her, that it didnt matter that I'd told her several times before all this that due to past trauma I really dont like doing anything sexual when I'm drunk. I realised none of that mattered to her at that moment in time, just her pleasure.

And so I mustered all my remaining strength to keep myself awake for enough time to have sex with her, so that I could get it over with, so that she could finally leave me alone and I could get some sleep, so that she would stop pushing me over and over to continue sleeping with her. I don't know if this means I consented to the sex seeing how I only did it cause she wouldn't stop pushing me to it otherwise.

Anyways, I kept falling in and out of consciousness before and during the sex, and it finally ended at around 10 p.m. (I think) after which I completely blacked out for the night. 

The next morning at around 4 a.m, I woke up to go to the bathroom, remembered the events of the night before and decided to try and figure out whether what had happened to me was coercion or not by searching some stuff online. I got back into bed and it turns out my girlfriend (who I thought was asleep, guess I woke her up when I left the bed) was actually awake and looked over my shoulder to see what I was searching online. She started asking if she'd coerced me into sex but I wasn't in the right state of mind to discuss it, I said we'd talk about it later.

Later in the day she brought it up again, I explained everything that I could remember from the times I wasn't blacked out the previous night. She said she couldn't remember anything after she started drinking, not a single thing. I don't know what to feel about that.

Because I think it's relevant, this isn't the first time something like this has happened. In July of last year,  we went out with some friends and then her and I came back to my place. I was almost completely blacked out, and she very nearly raped me. Completely ignored all my begging for her to stop and me saying that I didn't want to have sex. It only stopped because I had a serious panic attack. I remember thinking that the whole ordeal must've just been a nightmare when I woke up the next morning, until we found a condom stuck inside her, and all the memories came flashing back. She said she couldn't remember anything after we started drinking, that she couldnt remember almost raping me. The whole experience traumatised me and from how regretful she was about the whole thing I thought it wouldn't ever occur again. Until now. Until this.

Now... I don't know what to do. I love her. But this is all getting too messed up.

TL;DR: I think my girlfriend coerced me into sex a few nights ago when I was blackout drunk, after a similar incident months ago, and I don't know how to proceed.",1713201526.0,

I have truly, never seen someone so so perfect. If you would have laid eyes on him, you'd be driven insane too, I promise. It's killing me. It's truly killing me, he is perfect. Ask anyone who knows or have seen him, they will also tell you the same thing. I've never felt to overwhelmed by lust before.

It pains me, it really pains me. Deep in my chest. Because I cannot have this man. All I can do is daydream. I relay the kiss and the way he touched me everyday. His black hair. There is no flaw on him. This is a person, you only come across once. 

I feel like I'm under a spell. He can't be real. You know how sirens allure pirates by their voice and beauty? Allure them to their death. I feel as if though he is creature similar to a siren.

I cannot stop thinking about him, it's killing me, it's really killing me. I need help. I look, and I look around. I have never seen someone like him, no one close. Yet I keep looking because he cannot me mine.

Oh, but what if he was mine. I wish he was mine. I would give anything for him to be mine. I'd give him everything he wanted. I'd treat him so right, so good. I could be everything. I'd GIVE everything to be his. I want a second chance. But god, I need him. I need him. Not in a sexual way. But there is something about this man that has trapped me. He's breathtaking. Why is lust so wrong. 

He's one of a kind. This is someone, that if he had taken modeling as his career choice, the industry would fall apart. This is someone, who you would see in an airport, and never see again.

By month 5, she was starting to have health issues and she needed really expensive medication.... I help her out with things financially because... she's really struggling.

Proper_Exchange_6249,My (M29) abusive ex (F30) from age 15 requesting me on Social Media,2,1c5wqeb,4,"I dated this girl for about a year when I was 15. Beautiful, charismatic, but came with a black box warning from my friends who went to high school school with her (I went to a different school).  
At the time, I was naive. I didn’t believe them. I couldn’t see past her good looks and vibrant personality. She was a lot of fun.

  
Not even a few weeks into our relationship she became emotionally and sexually abusive. Lying to me about using birth control, “losing” $50 I gave her for plan B (a lot for a 15 yr old), stealing jewelry from my family, forcing me to have sex with her sometimes 5 times a day even, controlling who I talked to and hung out with, made me delete all of the girls out of my phone (including my cousins), yelling at my sister for “talking to me too much”. If I said “no” or pushed back at all, she would turn physical. There were times she beat the shit out of me and all I could do was sit there and take it, trying to get her to stop.

  
But it was so strange, I was hooked on the push and pull of her loving me and the chaotic unpredictable nature of the relationship. The bad times were horrible, awful, vile, but when she loved me again and made me feel safe in that moment, it made me want her even more no matter how bad things were minutes before. I was trapped in her web.

  
Everything came to a head after one trip I took with her family. She saw some girl's name in my old iPod I took for the trip and proceeded to chase me into the street, punching me in the face and body, scratching me, and screaming. I bear hugged her, crying and begging her to stop.

  
I called home and my parents immediately booked me a flight back. Upon getting home, I decided I was done. I was far enough away at the moment that I physically felt safe enough to break up and needed to just cut her off completely and immediately. My not responding drove her insane, she called and texted and threatened me over and over again. She was from a sketchy area and had bad friends who she said were coming to my school with weapons to murder me. My parents had to take me out of school my Junior year for a few days to make sure I was safe.

  
Things finally quieted down until about a week later when she texted me to ask if she could come be in the recovery room for an upcoming surgery I was having. Like none of the past week had happened.  
I completely and effectively ignored her for the last 15 years. I have been in therapy for the last seven of those years working through the trauma of the experience, understood that the sexual abuse I endured was rape, and was diagnosed with PTSD. My psychologist says it sounded like she had BPD, which would make a lot of sense.

  
Our social circles did not overlap much, but she would come up in conversation every once in a while, which would always take me right back to being 15 years old and in distress.

  
About four months ago, out of the blue, she requested me on Facebook. I denied the request. Again a couple of days ago she then requested me on Instagram. This was triggering.

  
Part of me wants to know why she is reaching out. Does she not remember everything she did to me? Is she just curious what I’m up to? Has she sought help for her own issues? Has she come to a realization of her behavior and wants to apologize?

  
I would never make amends and she is no one I wish to re-introduce into my life, but considering all I’ve went through, an acknowledgment from her and apology for the hurt she has caused me for almost half my life would be quite healing.

  
Most of my friends are saying not to open the “door” even an inch. I’m a chronic optimist, I acknowledge reality but always hope for and see the best in people. My curiosity and hopefulness for personal reconciliation and closure is the devil on my left shoulder. It’s tough. I'm open to any thoughts or advice.",1713315528.0,
DuckDuckGooseQuak,I have an issue with my school's Gender Initiative,1,1c6152w,2,"\[NAW\]

I'm on a burner account because I recognize that the title is really bad, and I know for a fact I'm about to be flamed, but here's the story:

(Real quick, there's a lot of background, but it's necessary to understand what happened, and exactly what I'm struggling with.)

I go to a music school, and something I learned is that in order for a music school to call itself a music school, it has to be certified by the National Association of Schools and Music. This is done through applications, papers, interviews with the Dean, interview with students, and a Recital that highlights all the major areas of the school. For this post, we are focusing on the Recital.

Another thing to know is that my school has a club who's focus is to highlight Women in Music. They do this by promoting events, planning field trips to events, advocating for women artists, and performances that highlight women artists. Before I go any further, I want to say that I love this group. I used to be a very active member, with my activity fading only because of schedule conflicts with the meetings. I love everything that this group does for women musicians, and I wish every school had something like this. 

Going back to the recital, one area that the school decided to highlight was the Jazz Department, and they decided to reach out to the club to form a Combo and perform a piece written by a woman composer. This group normally has bigger performance groups that invite everyone to perform, but due to the nature of the performance, they decided to feature a Combo of primarily Women and Non-Binary musicians. Again, this is not an issue. I've had the pleasure of performing with these musicians in the past, and they are absolutely incredible at what they do. Our issue comes to just one of the musicians. 

Now, I didn't personally sign up because I recognize that as a Straight White Male, that defeats the entire purpose of the organization, but I know people who did sign up because they knew that there were not that many people of that instrument. The person who got the spot is non-binary, but they don't play the instrument. Don't get me wrong, they are very talented, but not at the instrument that they signed up to play. 

I also want to make it clear that I am all for people trying new things, and in any situation, I would 1000% support them in this. My issue comes in when you realize that they were performing for a recital that is supposed to highlight the school by showcasing the best of the best in each department, and of the 6 performers, 5 people fit the bill. The performance was embarrassing, I held out hope for the musician, but it was over from the start, their technique was rough, and that meant the sound quality suffered. During their solo, they were no where. It was a rough way to attempt to showcase the program. 

I'm making this clear again, I'm not upset that a non-binary person got the role. My frustration comes in when you realize that this person got the role because they were non-binary, even though they weren't very good. Everyone else on that stage (all women) absolutely killed it, and I know through personal experience working with them that they know their stuff. This one musician dragged the entire performance down, and it's because this instrument is not their primary instrument. On their actual instrument, they are amazing. This is a performance that was about highlighting the studies that happen here, and there were so many other people (including women) who could've showed that to the world. I have no doubt that the certification will get approved because that was one performance on a 90 minute program, so all is well, but as a student who studies that instrument every day, it was embarrassing to watch because of what it implies about our work.

First-Department-408,What do I do for my friends child ,1,1c60ykg,0,"I want to start this off by saying I am by no means parent shaming, I understand kids are hard, I’m just concerned. 
    So I, (22f) met my this girl who we’ll call Cassidy (23f) at my first job. She seemed cool, but she very much acts for attention and is a pretty standard pick me. A year into this job I became pregnant with my first child (now 2) and about 3 months later, Cassidy announced she was also pregnant, I decided to leave the job to be a sahm as it was my first. Fast forward to last year and I reconnect with her, we talk pretty often and we start taking our kids on walks together and to the zoo and such. After the first visit I noticed something wasn’t right. Her child is premature, but that was not the issue. She does nothing with her child and complains about her constantly, the poor kid doesn’t have any kind of sleep schedule, they don’t help her learn to stand or walk or talk, and she lets her eat full sized candy bars and ice cream bars just so she can take a picture and caption it something like “she just couldn’t let mommy have it.” Now usually, I would just block her and call it a day, but because I know I’m the only one that visits them that actually does anything with her, and I’m the only reason they even go outside I feel obligated to remain her “best friend.” Their house is pretty bad as well, I get not being able to clean due to mental/physical health, but she’s in therapy and has no physical ailments. At first I did what I could to help Cassidy adjust to motherhood, but she just rejects any and all help, but will continue to complain. I’m worried for that child’s future. 
    It just seems to me like she only had her child for attention. ",1713328385.0,
PsychologicalSlip465,Got broken up with out of nowhere,1,1c60yhd,1,"I (F) got broken up with last week out of nowhere. Relationship of over 3 years (I don’t want to share my exact age but I’m between 20-25) so that’s pretty significant given how young I am. But yeah, he randomly showed up on my porch one day last week, came inside and broke up with me. 

I am having so many mixed emotions but this fucking hurts. Was our relationship a forever relationship? Maybe not, and I think I knew that. We had our problems mutually and I definitely am not claiming to be a saint here. But I don’t think he could see just how much of myself I put in and sacrificed for him. He says I wasn’t willing to change for him or put effort in, but he wanted me to fit into his life instead of us mutually building a life / fitting into each other. I changed my whole life for him, I live with my parents but I’ve barely spent any significant amount of time with them in over 2 years because i’m always at his. I tried to make myself fit into his life but it was so hard and exhausting. I guess no wonder he felt like I didn’t try. There was nothing left of myself to give when I’m in a constant state of emotional exhaustion from the (toxic) environment in his household. I’m not the kind of person who can spend 24/7 with people, but it made him upset when I fought him on it so eventually I stopped fighting. That isn’t even the half of it but i’m trying to keep this a reasonable length.

 It just hurts because from my perspective (and my family/friends) if anyone should’ve been ending the relationship it was me. I know that’s awful to say and that’s not a relationship I should want to stay in but fuck. I just wish I could’ve seen it coming at the very least. Up until he ended it, he was still telling me he wants to be with me forever. I felt so unbelievably blindsided. (Two days before my final research paper was due I might add and he knew that but whatever - my prof gave me an extension on the paper after I told her my situation so it’s okay lol)

I’ve had some good days and bad days since then. On the good days I know this is for the best. If anything it gave me an out, and in a way where I didn’t have to directly hurt him to help myself (a major reason why I haven’t ended it yet- he has a lot to worry about and I didn’t want to make things harder for him because I care about him). But the bad days are BAD. The reasons he gave for ending it feels kind of superficial and I am trying not to internalize it as my inherent worth lol but it’s very difficult to not do that!! It’s just so hard to sit here and realize I won’t ever get to kiss him again, or be held by him. and on those bad days, he is the only person I want to go to for comfort but I can’t. 

This is the first time I have been dumped (in the past I have ended my relationships) and wow it sucks. I can’t help feeling like this is unfair, that he gets to end things without even having to hear my side of the story. I didn’t want to dump all that on him in the moment, and now I don’t want to make it a competition by telling him how I felt in our relationship if that makes sense. We texted briefly I told him to let me know when he is ready to have a conversation (I have some questions and also want to say my piece) but he didn’t reply to that message (which doesn’t surprise me) but now I have this fear that he won’t ever reply, idk if that’s realistic.

I feel like I am rambling and losing my point. Sorry this was so long I just needed to tell someone.

DifficultOccasion208,My boyfriend is too much,1,1c60vnr,0,"I love my boyfriend, BUT he is very clingy. He wants to talk to me on the phone 24/7. He texts me all the time. He told me he waits for my calls and texts when he’s at work or at home. I did tell him he can’t wait on me all the time and to do his own thing. He works 6 days a week and the 1 day he has off he wants to spend the whole day with me. He doesn’t have a car right now because side his car is broken down. I usually go see him when he gets off work every few days and he always misses me right after I leave. Then the next day he calls me and tells me he misses me so much. I had to convince him to go fishing or hangout with his friends so he can have fun without me.

It’s not really an issue, I just wished he didn’t revolve his whole life around me and have a life outside of our relationship doing his own things too. I feel like I have stopped missing him because we talk and see each other so much. When we speak on the phone I don’t have anything to say to him anymore because I feel like we have talked about it all every single day 24/7. I guess I kinda feel suffocated, and I feel bad for feeling that way because I love him. 

I did tell him to go have fun without me. That he should also have some time to himself that doesn’t involve me. I hope he understands it’s not because I don’t want to spend time with him, but because I don’t want him to forget about himself since he’s so indulged into our relationship. ",1713328113.0,

I never knew how to do my hair, do a cartwheel, color perfectly in the lines, organize my room, wear cute outfits, etc… these are all things I feel like little girls bond over.  I loved “dude” stuff like learning about random facts about gross shit  or eating things I wasn’t supposed to 😂😂😂 I was even friends with my friends dads because I knew they wouldn’t reject me like other girls did.  Now in college I seek approval from my male professors especially if they’re strict or extremely intelligent and I feel like I am hostile towards authoritative women figures because I assume they don’t like me just like my mom.  I’ve had some teachers Who were female who I loved so much and when they showed me that they cared about me I really loved them and those are the teachers that made me want to be a teacher.  However in college I don’t know why I just haven’t been taking them as seriously because they also aren’t as strict and don’t teach classes that are as interesting to me and I need that pressure/ it means more to me if I succeed in a  challenging clsss because then it proves to me that I really am smart.  I don’t think anyone is dumb, just me lol but I always compete with girls and not guys and that is horrible because I am a girl but I always just feel like I will be rejected by them because I have been bullied and abused by women way more than men.

She is exactly my kind of girl and I might be hers. I get a feeling that she knows I like her because the way I treat her. And I get a vibe that she also likes me but she is just stopping herself for some reason.

dekhijayegi,I feel like I had my social life snatched away from me,2,1c5w353,1,"Hello everyone, I'm sorry I'm a teen(17M) and therefore, what you're going to read is probably gonna be immature. Anyhow, for most of my school life, I had been that quiet kid sitting in the corner, and honestly I was lonely but it wasn't too bad. It was only in my final 3 years at school(and Tuitions) that I made valuable friendships. But then it is over, 
And I was hoping to go to college, but my parents got me into a full time night shift job instead, so now, I have a job and a schedule which doesn't match with anyone, so people from old social circles go out without inviting me. A friend recently cancelled a plan on me thrice which is fine but he legit didn't even tell me he cancelled it(so the first time, I took a one hour leave from my job and reached the place to find it empty). 
I cannot go to college for at least a year because my parents think I'm too devoid of social skills and that a job will help
But I hate it here, the job itself isn't too hard
But the colleagues have no understanding of boundaries
And ask questions that make me uncomfortable(like how I use my hand while pleasuring myself or whether or not i'd like to go to a prostitutes place with them) 
I'm tired,....I have a best friend but her schedule is exactly opposite that of mine, so we barely get to talk, only on Sundays we get free time and she's preparing for a national exam so I don't want to burden her. 
But I'm tired...I want friends
A few years ago I succeeded in making online friends but that's not possible nowadays cause instagram GCs are either dominated by homophobes(I'm not gay but still hate makes me  uncomfortable) or people thinking it's absurd to have an online friendship (which it might be now)

Also, now there is no place where I feel comfortable or even welcome. I don't know how to explain this feeling but I feel so out of place everywhere
There's no place I can go to seek comfort
Even if I visit places with memories and nostalgia

Inevitable-Iron-5101,Heart broken don't know what to do,1,1c60mgx,1,"30M. Posting this on a burner as my now ex lurks on here.  
Background: Me and ex 22F both have anxiety in relationship. Ex has adhd as well. Just noting these things so they could be understood later.  
Recently broke up with ex due to me being upset over a misunderstanding. I messed up and got upset due to thinking my ex was being petty with me. We agreed that while I play videogames she could do her art for a certain period of time. I went over that time on accident. She stated she was grouchy after that and chose to keep doing her art on the couch and seemed distant with me after I explained that it was an accident and it was the first time that it had happened. She then proceeded to fall asleep. I woke her up later pretty late in the night to go to bed and she woke up and then got up and threw herself perpendicular on the bed and didn't say a word. I didn't really have space to sleep in my own bed and was woken up by her early that morning. I felt pretty cranky and did a horrible job of controlling my own emotions as I felt that she had done all of that on purpose as a way to get back at me. I lashed out and told her that I thought she was being petty and didn't listen to her when she said she wasn't and that she didn't mean anything. She's a really deep sleeper and didn't mean any of that. I told her I love her but that she is not right. She then proceeded to break up with me. I apologized and told her that's not what I want and that it's ok to just admit that's what happened as she had even stated before she was angry that she got ready to see me for me to go over the time spent. I had anxiety in the past regarding trust and I should have trusted her. In the past we both had worries about the other being around the other sex. Something I will mention that contributed to that behavior of being anxious was that my ex would get really upset whenever there was a minor issue such as me telling her I feel that she was being a bit high energy sometimes and asking her to relax when I was tired in a non aggressive manner. She would get sad and break down and run and avoid me for a bit and it would make me think I was going to lose her which furthered my anxiety. I would tell her that I still love her it's just a small thing and people get annoyed sometimes but she would visibly break down as if I hated her and run away. The anxiety just got worse with every problem as we both had issues communicating. I offered to go to couples therapy she didn't want to.  
I don't know what to do. I love her so much she brings joy to me I just get anxious when I feel like I'm losing her. I messed up hard by not taking her answer at face value but I didn't think that it hurt her so much. The good times we had were the best of my life. We dated for over a year and she felt like the one to me but we are different people and think differently emotionally. She states I'm a good person but that the relationship is too toxic. I want to fix it and I didn't view the arguments we had as toxic as they weren't frequent and we had a lot of good time. I feel it is too late to get her back and the only thing I can do is work on myself and my anxiety and how I contribute to issues. I just don't want to lose her forever. Is there anything I can do?

Since I was young I've been alone. It started in grade 6. I was the weird kid, I just wanted to fit in but I never understood social rules well. I remember I've never felt like the first choice or anyone's favourite person. I haven't had a best friend since I was like 9. I remember this one kid who would pretend to be my friend to make fun of me. 

As I grew up things didn't get better. I remember in grade 7 I was bullied for my mental differences. That's I think around when it started. I didn't fit in and didn't have friends so  I created one in my head named Nathan. I would pretend to do things with him and hang out. He kept me company when I was alone. I would play outside with him and explore the woods. This continued through grade 8. I was always the weird kid. I just didn't understand social stuff and there was alot going on. Me and this character would make comics and hang out at recess. 

In grade 9 I made friends but I never ever felt like I belonged. I always just felt left out and like I didn't fit in. Covid happened and it turns out one of the kids was a pervert and I don't talk to them now. At the start of grade 10 I created my current ""friend"", Micheal. I've created so many details including his family life that I have a whole dynamic with. We hang out all the time and are very close. I go on long walks and imagine we talk.

I was in love with her from the start. I couldn't read well due to having dyslexia, so I only could understood a few words in her letter which were, 'drink milk and burp to remember me.' The reason she wrote that was because when we would eat in the cafeteria we used to drink lots of milk and see who can burp the longest and loudest. Then, in October 2019, during my freshman year in high school, a girl named Isabella approached me in band class. At first, I didn't recognize her, but when she asked if I was who she thought I was, all the memories flooded back. I realized I was still in love with her.

,Sorry this is long,1,1c6068i,0,"I constantly struggle with my self value. I work for a nonprofit and enjoy my job but always question if I do it to cover up how shitty I am. I know there are things I've done that have made people's lives worse and things I've said that are just outright awful. 

I have been cut off from people I care about and cut off people who cared about me. Being alone is what I've set my social life because I never had space nor trust but with my work life I make connections with people under a fake happy personality.

Over the years I've built a facade of someone who is always positive and happy but I lock down any real conversations about myself. I take true interest in others and strive to make everyone feel better about life and themselves. Making other people laugh is probably my only joy at this point, but I want to have genuine conversations but every friend I've been honest with has left so I stick to my facade.

As I leave this job I have been told by multiple people that I have had a positive impact on their lives yet I doubt that beyond belief. I was told by one that I was the first posive male in their life, another said I was a prominent male figure since their dad left them, and by another that I restored their faith in men, and it all sound fake as shit to me.

ehmalt,I (21m) have been in love with my friend (21f) for almost a decade,1,1c6058p,0,"
So to preface, this friend has been in a long-term relationship for maybe 5/6 years. I have ***NO*** plans on pursuing my feelings, trying to break them up, coming in between them- ***nothing***. I consider myself friends with her bf, and he's a good guy too. I will never tell her how I feel and plan to keep things the status quo for the long term, and I'm ~~happy~~content with that.

We met back in my Freshman year of high school, and honestly, while I don't remember when I first noticed her I wanted to know her. We somehow became friends and tbh feelings developed soon after, which my awkward 15/16 year old self didn't really do anything with. She soon started dating this guy who turned out to be (without divulging her privacy) an awful person, and she eventually broke up with him. Nonetheless, I hold a lot of guilt for not intervening when I should have, and it's my fault that they ended up meeting in the first place. It's not even a thought in her mind to hold any kind of grudge against me, but I have a grudge against myself for that. While she was dating that previous guy, I did what I could but I know I tried to intervene then both to help her but also because of my romantic feelings towards her.

The guy eventually forced us to stop talking, and we didn't from that point until they broke up. When they did break up I was one of the first people she reached out to, and I was just overjoyed to be talking with her again. Part of me thought it could be the chance to try to ask her out, but the day I was planning on doing so she started going out with the current guy. That broke my heart, of course, to not blame her- she's her person and I didn't then or do now expect her to pander to my feelings. I was deeply disappointed but the fact that she was back in my life was all I needed and I stuffed those feelings down and away. I eventually became interested in other girls and we stayed close through the rest of High School. 

After graduation, she sent me a long text thanking me for being such a good friend, and this is what breaks me, said that she let me down and she was grateful I wanted to be in her life still. We ended up going to different schools and went on different paths, as people do in life. We went from seeing and talking to each other every day to a few texts per month. I honestly believed our friendship was over, and I was coming to terms with that. I don't know how but we reconnected and have been in touch much more recently. Again, nothing romantic whatsoever. It reminded me of why I was so grateful to have her in my life as I did back in high school.

We recently hung out, went for a long drive in the countryside, and caught up. It was amazing, and I wish it could have lasted hours longer. I realized afterward that those feelings I buried deep down in high school were still there. I kept a small candle on for her this entire time. Thinking about this, I know there's nothing I can do but accept I have those feelings and move on with my life. The guy she's dating is good and she has regained the independence she lost when she was in that awful prior relationship, and I couldn't be more proud of her. I attended her senior thesis as well and it just reminded me of how deeply I care about her and how again, proud I was of her. 

She'll likely marry the guy she's with now, and I'll happily go to her wedding. Even if she didn't end up marrying him, and she somehow became single I don't know if I would try and pursue a relationship with her. The past decade we have known each other for, all of the things we have been through as individuals and together, the trust she has in me as a trusted friend, I don't think it's worth risking it. So I won't. I feel like I know her pretty well, and I have a strong feeling that she would not try to pursue anything with me, and I've come to accept that too.

All in all, whatever the future has in store, I just want her to be happy. She is an honest-to-good gift to this planet and she will help a lot of people. She has made such a lasting impact on my life, and I hold so much compassion for her. While I doubt these feelings will ever truly go away, c'est la vie. I hope I get the blessing of having her stay in my life for the foreseeable future. Even if she isn't, I'm grateful for the experience and what she's taught me.",1713325676.0,
CallTraditional9043,How come a coffee invitation turns into a life lesson ,1,1c604ye,0,"Two years ago, I met a guy from a dating app. I had been in a long-distance relationship for almost two years before meeting him. At that time, my long-distance relationship had ended over a month prior, but I still had feelings for my ex. Despite the pain, I decided to download a dating app, and that's when I met him. We bonded over a shared love for a particular book, and after two weeks of chatting, he invited me for coffee. Instead, I suggested we hang out at his apartment. We watched movies, had a beer, and ended up having sex – my first real experience, which was enjoyable. We did it twice that night. 

A week after, I had a really sad moment while out with friends, leading to a night of heavy crying over my ex. Despite my conflicting emotions, when the guy from the app messaged me again the next day, I agreed to meet up, though my heart and mind weren't fully into it. We had sex once more, and I stayed the night at his place. The next morning, he arranged for a ride home for me and kissed me on the forehead goodbye. We both acknowledged it was likely the last time we'd see each other, as he was returning to his country after a stint in the province. It was clear to me that it was just a hookup. 

And now It's been two years, and while I've moved on from my long-distance ex, I find it difficult to forget about him. I can't help but think that if we had met under different circumstances, things might have worked out. It was a mistake to seek companionship while still healing, and now I regret everything.",1713325649.0,

I wont get into detail on what they did to me, i dont think i need to, but i remember being so scared, yet so attracted to them. I looked up to them. I wanted to be with them forever because i could trust they had no reason to leave me like everyone else. 

They wanted me, and i was happy to give.

But i got brave. Stupidly brave. They lied to me about so many things, and their burthday was coming in a few days. They were going to turn 18, and god knows what was going to happen if i brushed it all off.

i confronted them about my suspicions, and lo and behold, they just switched from the loving funny and quirky guy i loved, to this condecending tone. It felt so humiliating? 

I left her, and 6 months later, i regret it all. I regret throwing away the one person that loved me all because i was too sensitive to just accept what was.

I pray every hour that they come back to me. I want them to know how sorry i am. That i shouldve never made such a big deal out of my anger.

Crazy-Leave-8231,"I (20,M) have a burp fetish, and it makes my life miserable",2,1c5vcpe,0,"Throwaway acc. 
I had this 'condition' since 2nd grade, when I noticed my male classmate's burps turned me on. Ever since then I can't go a week without hearing a guy burp. I have hundreds of videos saved on a private playlist on youtube just for this purpose. 

The fact that I myself hate burping probably make things worse. I looked up a few forums on the topic, and I mostly saw negative comments, like how they hate having this kind of fetish, and I feel the same for a while now. I'm unable to build long lasting friendships with men, because if I hear them burping once and it 'pleases' me, I can't wait another day to hear them do it again. 

I even noticed that any guy doesn't plesase me. The best is if they are muscular, and I prefer to hear fit guys burping, who are around my age or slightly older. 

I don't really know what else to write, I just wanted to vent a bit, I guess. ",1713311669.0,
Humans_r_evil,"Hey guys, i recently just got reminded that I was a 40 year old virgin, thought I'd share how unlucky i was compared to my siblings.",18,1c5ea36,10,"life was rough growing up with super strict abusive parents.  I couldn't have any friends and wasn't allowed to take showers because they said we weren't worth the water and we were only born so they could suck on welfare.  we were to always come home straight away after school and not allowed to have friends, or else face a metallic yardstick lashing that would leave bloody welts for weeks.  We were stupid and thought it was normal and so ignorant because as children, you tend to believe your parents.

It didn't help that i was picked on because i grew up in a white neighborhood that mocked me on the daily.  it didn't help that i stank because i only showered once a week.

Anyway, sob story aside, i only said that to highlight the fact that even to this day I secretly have PTSD and extreme social anxiety even though i have tried many times to get past it.  Truth be told, my mind freezes up a lot and i always studder when talking to people.  It's not so bad now but it still happens.  
Anyways I noticed early on that even in middle school, girls would treat my brothers differently than me.  I was the shortest of us 3, but it's just crazy to see their expressions change from boredom to excitement when they shift their eyes from me to my brother who was 1 year younger.

when we grew up we gtfo our parents place asap and roomed up together in a shitty apartment.  we'd finally take proper showers and dressed with proper clothes.  we'd still share clothes though because we weren't financially well off.  We'd usually just walk or take the bus to the mall or nearby stores and shop together all the time.  But this is where i noticed major red flags that told me I was fucked:  girls would literally throw themselves at my brother and flirt with him hardcore.  they would straight up just walk past me and ask my brother out on the spot.  It happened on the daily.

He even had a girl pay for his entire college tuition, he was that hot i guess.  it was clear as day how big the mountain i had to climb was if i wanted any romance in my life.

Eventually after the 2nd year of my brother being in college, i left for the military because i wanted a productive way to die.  if I died, so be it, if i make it out, i'm going to college.  Ironically, bootcamp was the easiest thing ever thanks to mom and dads strict and abusive upbringing.  Well, i made it out and began going to college, despite my social anxiety.

During this time in college, my youngest brother got tired of my parents shit and began working out hardcore, he beat up my dad and ended his reign of terror over us.  and literally beat up the entire highschool football team.  he was also ready to die.  But as soon as the coach saw how strong and powerful he was, he got invited to the team and got along well with everyone once he humbled them.  The coach was a great mentor to him and was exactly what he needed in life.  anyway girls were throwing themselves at him too, and even bought him expensive cars and even rented an apartment for him.  i was like wtf, why don't i ever get that kind of treatment?

after a year they'd have several dozens of girlfriends already and i was still a virgin at 26.  I was jealous of them, of how easily it was for them to get into relationships, and how easily they overcame their social anxiety and trauma.  I couldn't hate them though, they were still humble and good guys.  Yes my youngest brother was ready to throw hands at any moment, but that was only because other people started it.  He was never one to start fights but believe in mutual respect.

I've tried so hard to get into relationships but i suppose I was ugly, or something about me just made women dislike me.  I got the bad genes, I guess.    Anyway the mountain i was climbing just never seemed to end and at around 35 i finally gave up.  No girl ever gave me a chance in my last 35 years, why would they now?  The definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over while expecting different results.  I did not want to dream anymore, delude myself all the way until death.  that would just be sad and pathetic.

My 1-year younger brother ended up becoming a computer scientist and married a morbidly obeese girl because he liked her personality.  god bless him, still a good guy to the end. It's crazy how even now there would still be women insulting his wife to try and get him to leave her.

my youngest brother still has a fire in him, and he had channeled it into becoming a slumlord.  He buys and rents homes and gives only the minimum amount to the real estate agents.  3% commission, and they're too afraid to ask for more lol.  He's worth around 19 million atm.

compared to them i'm trash, my college degree in electronics has become worthless.  i make more money flipping burgers.

I've ditched all my friends and even family members and rarely keep in contact with them.  I've holed up in an apartment far far away from them.  I got tired of them asking me why I'm not married, I got tired of lying to them 'i'm just not interested.'  I die inside everytime.  Can't handle it.  Right now i've escaped into video games and anime.   Just recently saw people commenting about how unrealistic it is for anime girls to just throw themselves at the protagonist, but i saw it happen to my brothers a lot.  It may not happen to you, and it definitely doesn't happen to me.  but it does happen IRL.

I'm going to be 43 soon and just thought i'd make this confession.",1713268710.0,

Full_Berry1346,I moved out as soon as i turned 18,4,1c5p6tg,2,"This is just some recent events that i want to share anonymous. My read and writing isnt very good and im relying on spell check on my phone so spelling and gramma might be weird. Sorry. I changed all the names in the story including mine.  
  
  
Im female and i just turned 18. Until last week i lived with my family who are my dad who is 49, my twin brother and sister billy and tracy who are 15, my youngest sister ali who is 13. I also have an older brother james who is 25 he has his own flat. He is my dads son from an old relationship but his reel mum was never around so he called my mum 'mum'. When i was 5 my mum died from child birth when she was having ali.  
  
  
When i was 13 i new i wanted to move out as soon as i was old enough so i started working and saving. I got a paper round when i was 13 and started a weekend job in a shop when i was 16. I saved most of my wages and i managed to save up over £8000. So i can live for a while until i get a full time job or a hairdressing apprentice. My current job cant give me full time hours but they upped it a bit now im old enough to work more.   
  
  
I dont want to go on a long rant so ill give my reasons for moving out in built points.  
  
  
•	Im the black sheep. My dad totally forgot i existed after my youngest sister was born. She was tiny and needed lots of attention which took allot of his time. After looking after her he had billy and tracy who were only 2 then. But he managed to make time for james his first born son. James was the only one who noticed me and listen to me. When i was older i stopped bothering trying to get attention. I spent allot of time in my room drawing.  
  
  
•	The younger kids were spoiled and i had my stuff taken from me if they wanted to play with it and i didnt want to share. One of them took and broke my 3ds when i was 6 and at school and i never found out who which was why i didn't want to share. It never got replaced either even though i just had it for christmas.  
  
  
•	I always got the blame for stuff even when it wasnt my folt. The day i decided i wanted to move out i found ali in my room playing with my expansive colouring pens. I told her to stop and get out of my room which she did but she fell down the stairs (my room is in the attic). She told dad that she asked nicely to use my pens and i said no and pushed her. He believed her and i had my pens taken from me.  
  
  
•	After i did my gcses i wanted to go to college and do a hairdressing course. Dad wouldn't let me and made me retake my gcses because i did badly in most of them except for art. I failed all of them again last year so he made me do them again this year.  Im just wasting my time in school now and my teachers actually agree.  
  
  
So i moved into a furnished houseshare and live with 4 other women. Bills and council tax are included in the rent which my wages cover and I'm dipping into my savings to buy food until i can get full time work.   
  
  
I left home very earl in the morning of my 18th birthday which was last monday. I was gone before everyone woke up. I grabbed my suitcases which i packed the night before and left. I did leave a.note saying i was moving to my own place but i didnt give an address.  
  
  
I started getting texts and calls a couple of hours later from my dad and my younger brother and sisters i didn't answer them. Shortly after that james called and i answered. James was relieved to know i was safe. I explained what i had done and why and he understood. He used to try to avocate for me at home when i was ignored or mistreated so he knew the shit i went through.   James did tell my dad what i was doing and he told me he was gonna go all 'told ya so' on him. I keep getting texts and calls and dad showed up to my work looking for me, but i wasnt on shift at the time. My manager told me about it and that he had asked them what my address was, but they told.him they couldn't reveal confidental info.  
  
  
He showed up to my work again on saurday when i was in shift. I continued stocking shelfs and gave him the same responses id give to a random customer. He tried to convince me to meet with him to talk after my shift causing me to break character. I told him he had years of chances to talk with me and i was done. He tried stuttering apologies at me and my manager (who knew a bit of what was going on) saw and told me i could take my break. He didnt come back on sunday.  
  
  
Now I've started getting facebook messages from kids at school. Kids who wouldn't give me the time of day before were suddenly acting all concerned and asking why i 'ran away from home'. I didn't respond to the messages but i just put up a status saying that i didn't run away that i am adult and just moved out and i added on the end that i was safe.  
  
  
James called me and told me dad was upset about my post because people were starting to thing i had a bad home life. Well its true. I wasnt abused so i know im luckier than many but my home life was shitty and miserable. Now i am actually allot happier. My housemates are great and im keeping contact with james. I have a job interview at a factory tomorrow for full time work fingers crossed.

catecate0228,I love my boyfriend but I don't feel at ease with our relationship.,1,1c5zecs,0,"I'm not writing here to ask anyone what to do. I know exactly what to do. I just don't have enough courage to do so.

I've been seeing this guy for 7.5 months. He went into this with so much promise saying I'm the one and the promise of moving in together by the time I had ended a professional commitment in the current city where I live and where we met. He relocated 5 hours away for work which I knew about and said I don't mind cause realistically, it isn't that far. I could visit, he could visit. That's exactly what we've been doing. 

Over the past few months, he has changed. Mostly under delivering everything he promised in the beginning. Whenever I'm coming over to his place for a few days, I always hear him talk to his friends and play games all night and complains to me about how busy he is at work. Can't respond to me sometimes because he had to focus at work (he's working from home) but I literally see him when I come over having his discord and whatsapp open the whole time on his desktop. I get it, I could really be overbearing. And I guess he doesn't just wanna get sidetracked. I mean, I've changed too. I became too critical and probably demanding.

The problem lies in.... he doesn't try to integrate me into his life. He goes to a lot of shit with friends and he's even telling me his friends bring their girlfriends. So why can't he bring me? Actually, I think he already gave me an answer to this. He said its because he's still not sure about me so he didn't wanna make a fool of himself by introducing me to his friends and family and then tell them we broke up (when/if we do). I'm his first serious relationship and I get where he's coming from. I just don't feel uncomfortable with the things he does, the things he talks about with his friends that I hear, him basically thinking anyone thats not on his job level are below him, and most importantly.... the lying. He has lied to me several times. And I forgave him. It's usually a non negotiable but... he meant that much to me or maybe I just didn't know my worth.. :'( 

Last Saturday, I bought a last min train ticket to get to where he is because he was dead set on breaking up (long story, it was my fault. Not abt cheating tho). I told myself that me coming here isn't about winning him back. If this is the last thing I do for our relationship, I'm doing it for me. I just wanna be with him for the last time. But when I got here, I asked him to take me back and I asked him if he really wanted this to be over. There was a mix of answers. At some point he said this is it and then at some point he said he didn't want this to be over but I have to calm down.

Now I'm in bed waiting for him to get here. Though I'm certain he wouldn't wanna talk. But I wanna ask him things that are on my mind. I love him a lot but I don't think it's good for me to feel anxious everytime he goes out or talk to his friends thinking he might be doing something behind my back.

I'm ready for what could happen. He could breakup with me and I'm trying to make peace with it. ",1713323316.0,

DoggoTamer27,I finally confessed my feelings to a friend of 12 years and it’s both the best and worst thing I could’ve done. ,5,1c5lqa5,3,"I grew up around another family that I over the years become really close with. I didn’t live with them, they just had kids, lived in the same small Alaska town that I did, and we all got along really really well. This was all 12 years ago and now myself and all of my friends are pretty much grown up. 

It’s no secret that the oldest daughter (ima call her A), and I have liked each other, multiple times in the past. Neither her or I deny it, but nothing was ever done really about it because what could be? I moved to Montana in 8th grade, and despite visiting Alaska still and still being close with As family and her herself as well, we never really acknowledged anything, even if I did find out she had feelings for me again. Abundantly, the cycle is pretty much the same. I’m gone, her and I just stay friends over Snapchat, I arrive in Alaska , at least one of us in the past has always usually fallen for the other. 

Recently this time though, I didn’t just have a liking for her. I don’t know if maybe it was how her personality had changed so positively from the last time that I saw her, but her and I started hanging out every night during my time in Alaska, and I fell for her hard. I thought maybe my feeling would somewhat fade or go away if I hung out with her more, because she also had a boyfriend during this time as well. Instead, being with her more did the complete opposite. Considering the history between her and I (and trust me there is QUITE a bit, not even romantically wise, we’ve just known each other so long) I decided that on my last day I would decide to just tell her, nothing else, just tell her and let her do with that information as she would.

I don’t know what I was really expecting, but mainly for her to get maybe a little mad or angry at me, which I could understand both then and now still, but I honestly just felt like I had to say something. 

After I finally told her though, nothing really changed. All she did was kind of laugh and smile and say that she had a boyfriend, but everything else stayed the same. She still hung out with me, still talked and laughed with me normally, even still went and hung out with a mutual friend at his house and sat next to me. The whole time, nothing about the vibe was off, in fact it seemed like she was almost giving hints she liked me too. She would say things like “why didn’t you tell me this a month ago before I met the f*cker” referring to her boyfriend. 

Finally, after we were done hanging at our friends house, we had an hour ride home. About 15 minutes in, I decided to just go for it. I still don’t know where I got this confidence, but I simply just asked if I could hold her hand. She kind of looked out the window smirking a bit, and I guess kind of thought it over, but overall she grabbed my hand and that’s how we stayed the rest of the car ride. 

Nothing else happened, and a few hours later she said that she loved her boyfriend and wanted to be with him, but that I didnt have to be sorry and I hadn’t done anything to make her uncomfortable or ruin our friendship in any way. Before I did leave though, I asked her one more thing, I told her she didnt have to answer if she didnt want to and regardless of the answer, she was with her boyfriend. I asked her if she was still with him would she have told me no? She looked at the floor and said “probably not” and just hesitated before saying “but I’m with him”. 

Honestly, I feel like this was the culmination of like 10 years finally hitting its climax. I know I just held her hand, but that moment felt so much more to me. I can’t remember the last time that I felt the way I did last night. Not even like a giddy excited that I was holding hands with a girl, just a true, pure, warm and happy feeling of life, and that it was all going to be ok. Then it just vanished as suddenly as it had appeared. I’m currently about to leave to go back to Montana, and it feels so wrong. Even though nothing would’ve happened anymore between A and I, regardless if I was there anymore, it still hurts. I still want to talk about it with her, want to go over it and just talk about what happened but I realize theres nothing else to really talk about, which hurts me in a way. She made her opinion clear, and I respect that. But it was such a roller coaster of emotions in only like 3 hours, and I feel like everything was all shoved in a box and ended with too fast, and I still feel like there’s an ending that’s missing and I’ve been left on a cliffhanger. 

That night doesn’t even feel real sometimes. It was only 20 minutes but felt and still feels like so much more than that, and I find myself wanting to talk and reminisce about it far more than others want to hear about it, and the worst part is the one I want to talk about it with the most is the one I can’t. 

Edit: Yes I know. I am technically a home wrecker. I have nothing against the guy she is dating and can tell you myself there definitely was a part of me that felt bad for going behind his back like that. It’s not right, and I think she realizes that too, and she’s going to be honest and tell him, which I understand. ",1713288015.0,

jordan_all1k,My brother (30M) slept with my friend (21F) and now my family says I ruined my brothers life,85,1c55cn1,22,"For some background, I (20m) just got out of a year long relationship due to her cheating on me and I have been super depressed about it. I live with my brother and when he found out he told me that I should reach out to friends and use this as an opportunity to find ""the real me"". I get along better with females more than males because I am an emotional person and when I talk to my guy friends I always get the ""damn that's crazy"" or ""bro just lock in"". So I asked my brother if I can have one of my friends come over. He told me absolutely and he mentioned that the night she comes over he will be at a poker game. Well when my friend ( I'll call her jade) comes over we start drinking and I'm opening up to her talking about my ex and how I lost my job. Our conversation goes till around 3 am. By this time me and jade are faded and my brother comes home. My brother knows how to make people open up (I now know it's his manipulative tactics) so her makes jade start talking about her past such as DV and SA. My brother starts comforting her and I try my best to be there to but my brother kept putting his hand in the way. By this time it's 5:30 am and she is throwing up (my brother is tipsy as well) and while jade is in the bathroom my brother tells me to go upstairs and sleep the drunk ness off. I sit at the top of the stairs while my brother sits her on the bed and for this brief moment I hear silence, I start to worry for some reason and I walk back down the stairs to the living room and see them full blown making out, I was pissed. I went and packed all my stuff and loaded my car up. I drove to my dad's house and sat on his porch and cried. The next day I call my brother and he tells me that I'm being completely unreasonable and that I should talk to jade because it wasn't about me when it came to them sleeping with each other. So I called jade, she told me she would come and pick me up so we could talk and when she got me she apologized. I told her she didn't need to apologize, I was mad at my brother because all that showed me was if I was to bring a girl over friend or not he would sleep with them. She told me that he was asking her on a date and said she didn't like him like that and it was a mistake. Well after I got done hanging out with her she ended up blocking and ghosting my brother.

I never said that to anyone so I asked him where he heard that and he started yelling at me telling me that doesn't matter who told him it's about the fact that I said he did. I looked at my mom and told her I never said that and she told me that I'm in the wrong and that my brother was there for me all these years so how could I say something that could lock him away for a long time. I just walked away and now I'm jumping from couch to couch because I lost my relationship from my mom and brother. I know my brother didn't raped my friend but I know I never told anyone otherwise.

HelterSkelterOtaku,I Lost My Orange Baby Boy ,4,1c5ok3z,2,"My orange baby boy, Boromir, wasn't even a year and a half yet, was euthanized on Sunday. The Sunday before, my baby Boromir stopped eating, wouldn't drink water, wouldn't go to the bathroom, and he kept throwing up. We immediately took him to the vet next day. They did x-rays, and said they discovered blockages. They gave him iv fluids and some meds and then sent him home with an assortment of meds to stimulate his appetite and help him with the vomiting and his bathroom issues. Few days past and it isn't working; he still refused to eat anything we tried to give him, and we gave him everything, or drink any water. He still was vomiting and not using the bathroom. Took him back to the vet, and they gave him more iv and changed the meds and told us if it doesn't change in a few days that we would need to do exploratory surgery to see what's going on. Nothing changes. So we schedule the surgery for Sunday morning. He was super cuddly (more than usual) the night before. We take him to the vet, and I'm hopeful that they'll fix him right up, so I only gave him a head pat not knowing this was the last time I was going to see him. They say to come back in a few hours. An hour later we (my wife and I) get a call from the vet. They say he swallowed a string and it destroyed his intestines so bad that there's nothing they can do, and that we need to come down and say our goodbyes. It was so heart-rending to see him on the table like that. The vet shows us part of what was inside him. It looks exactly like my black sewing thread that I've been using to put patches on my vest. I can't get the image of her giving him the shots, checking her watch, nodding and saying that he's gone, his lifeless body, out of my head. My poor baby boy, he was so innocent and loving and sweet. He didnt deserve this. Now I can't stop blaming myself. My wife keeps saying it's not my fault and that the string looked different than my thread and that it wasn't my thread. But I know what I saw. It was my thread. It was my fault. I killed my boy. If I wasn't so careless and thoughtless, and cleaned up my sewing mess better he'd still be here. If I wasn't so hasty my sweet boy would still be alive. I hate myself. My brain keeps expecting to see the little guy bound around the corner, doing his patrols (he's the alpha), trying to steal his sisters food. Expecting him to hop into bed to cuddle us for the night. Out of the corner of my eye, my brain sees him. It's so weird. I know he's gone, and there's nothing I can do to change it. But I wish I could rewind time. Never sew patches on my vest, or not be so careless, spend the whole night up with him instead of going to sleep. Give him more than a head pat when he was going to his surgery. I am utterly destroyed and filled with so much self-hatred self-animosity and self-loathing. 

Got his ashes back today in a beautiful hand carved box and a nice sculpture of his pawprint.

This all feels so surreal, like a bad dream that's taking forever to wake up from.

I dont even know why. I feel guilty about it, but i also dont at all because she isnt a good mother, i know shes trying but it just doesnt feel like shes doing it because she loves me, i think its just because she doesnt want me to become my sister. Whenever i tell her that i dont like her behavior she gets angry at me and then takes my stuff , and she loves to guilt trip me and act like she didnt do something that she did do, she always has to be the victim. 

I try to have a good relationship with her but she makes it so difficult. She asks me questions about why i did certain things and then when i tell her she just makes it about herself or turns it into a lecture. She has done some really messed up stuff to me like one time i didnt want to give her my phone so i held onto it really tight, i ended up falling onto the kitchen floor and then she proceeded to lift my up by my clenched arms and throw my body back into the ground, wrestling my phone out of my hand.  And when i was 10 i bought a new leotard for gymnastics, and she thought it was too small so she made me try it on in front of her, i asked her to get out so i could get into it and then show her but she refused so i started crying half naked in my bathroom with her just watching me, and once refused to try it on fully she returned it.

Human-Pen-2873,"I owe more than $1600 in therapy late fees, I feel like a mess, and have no idea what to do",2,1c5u0f2,0,"I M23 am currently facing $1600 balance from therapy late fees and I have no idea what to do. I’m currently still going to school full time due to COVID turning my last college into a crapshoot, with people being toxic toward me and tanking my mental health. Because of that, I recently decided to finally go seek therapy. Another thing that should be noted is that I’m on the spectrum, so among other things, I have mediocre time management skills. I spent hours researching therapists near me to make sure I get and luckily it paid off. 

Through Thriveworks, I found a telehealth therapist. For the sake of anonymity, let’s call him Jeremy. Jeremy is a very nice guy. He cares about his patients and he allows me to text him or call him for pretty much any reason. The only issue is that he has had to cancel multiple times due to health problems or sickness. Because of that, sometimes he would miss appointments and reschedule it at times that weren’t the most convenient for me. For instance, two times he rescheduled appointments while I was in the car on roadtrips, and a couple of times (like 2-3 times), he scheduled it on my busy day when I have back to back to back classes. Granted, I did agree to those appointments and I did miss many more appointments that weren’t his fault. But I still feel burned in a weird way. I don’t know, it might be wrong to feel this way, especially since in total I missed 12 appointments, less than half of which was because of the reasons I stated above.

I have no idea how I should handle this. I have gotten in contact with someone with Thriveworks but they are not willing to compromise much on the balance, plus the payment plans they offered aren’t feasible for me. I currently have $1,000 in credit card debt I’m currently paying off, I have impending college payments that I’m working to pay off, and I’m trying to buy a car by next fall because the field I’m going into requires me to travel a lot. I would look into asking my parents to help pay off the debt, but I already broke their expensive vacuum because I stupidly used it to get some water out of my rug. I feel lost, I feel like I have no where to go. Thank you for reading this long post, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1713308146.0,
LazyBlackCat777,I caught my partner cheating on me. He offered to work things out but I am quite lost and can't cooperate.,3,1c5ofrz,9,"I recently found out about my partner's little adventures out here on the internet. Throughout our relationship, he messaged about 4 girls (that I know of and have proof of) asking for their nudes or role playing in chat for self-pleasure. This is what they called micro-cheating. While it may not be as direct as cheating in itself, it is still a boundary that I told him when we were just at the beginning of our relationship. Watching porn is one thing, I can let it slide. But messaging girls and showing your private parts together to release some heat is something that I can't deal with.

I feel so stupid for only finding out about it when we have been together for YEARS, planned our future together, even to the point of creating a family and talking about getting married. I am stuck and lost, not knowing what to do in this situation. He was apologetic and told me various reasons why he is just immature and stupid for thinking that what he did is not cheating in his dictionary (despite knowing my boundaries). He kept asking me to forgive him and to start again. I agreed then and did my best to try and move pass it but I keep relapsing and getting mad out of the blue. There are days when I just want to give up, even though he's doing a great job at 'repenting', I on the other hand, is finding it so hard to cooperate with this ""making things work out"" stuff.

I keep replaying every single thing I saw that day and oh, I also found out lots of videos where he did erotic stuff with other women, I knew about this because he told me so but I also knew that he get rid of it as part of respecting my boundaries... but he kept a backup of it, on his old phone, in a memory card, there's a lot of backups which he then destroyed in front of me when I found out.

Now I keep looking through his stuff like a mad woman, especially online. I asked for all his accounts and keep tabs almost every night. I'm such a mess and I don't think I'm being so cooperative at making it all work out. At one hand, I want to give it another chance. On the other hand, I am so pissed off and just wanna be left alone for the rest of my life. He is now planning for us to go to a therapy. Probably to deal with his addiction and me dealing with anger stuff and the broken trust because of what happened. Will it help ease my pain? I wonder.

I'm a good woman, not that I did not do bad/rebel stuff when I was young but I am a good woman to him. I never did anything to broke his trust and is loyal to a fault. I am a ""good woman"", so why am I finding it hard to forgive and move on?

I guess, he's doing the best he can to let me know that he's changing. All the stuff we had differences about, he's trying so hard to change his way of life for me. My heart is telling me he deserves a chance but my brain keeps refusing to be cooperative. Am I crazy or what?",1713294505.0,

Action_Unlucky,I'm sexually attracted to cartoons and feel no attraction toward people,2,1c5tvcw,9,"For the past seventeen years, I have pleasured myself by delving into surreal fantasies about animated characters. I have never masturbated while thinking about a human being and have never even wanted to have sex.

Rather than sex, my fantasies are centered around transformation/possession. In my fantasies, I picture myself (or made-up surrogates) transforming into these characters and essentially being replaced with my consciousness obliterated. Not death exactly, but a complete removal of memories, personalty, and any semblance of who I once was. I am pleasured by the thought of human consciousness being altered or destroyed in various ways and transformed into something else. I care very deeply about friends and family, but I have never felt any sexual compulsion to connect with other people. My concept of sex/pleasure is completely internal and based completely on these fantasies. I don't even associate arousal with other people, just my own imagination and transforming into these characters.

Entire-Bass6385,My ex gf’s mutual friends are all blocking me and I don’t know why,1,1c5yhso,0,"I basically never use Reddit but I just need someone to tell me this has happened to them before.

  
I (23M) am an American college student studying abroad for my final semester. I went to Spain for my Jan term and developed a pretty close friend group with some of my fellow students, and that included a girl who I’ll call Ella (21F), who was my best friend at the time. Ella had expressed to me previously that she had feelings for me, but I told her I didn’t feel the same, and we continued to be friends. But while we were in Spain, we struck up a romance in the final week of the trip, and made things official on the last day.

  
She flew back to the States while I stayed in Europe for my Spring term. We were long distance for 3 weeks, but cracks started to form. I got a sense that she was somewhat controlling (although I didn’t realize that’s what it was at the time), and when I would push back on that, she took it as a sign of disrespect. After several extremely unproductive and downright exhausting conversations of this sort, the end seemed inevitable, although the last phone call we had ended in a way that it seemed we would give things one more shot with a new approach in mind. But I awoke the next morning to a text telling me it would be best if we ended things. I do fully believe that a breakup was necessary, but her list of reasons mainly included things that I had genuinely apologized and modified my behavior for and (I would argue) blatant mischaracterizations of things I had said to her, so I was pretty unsatisfied by this breakup, not least of all because it was done over text, too. But after a brief and somewhat heated back-and-forth that day, I have made no subsequent effort to talk to her.

  
I’ve been trying to enjoy my semester in Europe, but in the back of my mind, I have been somewhat anxious about where I stand with our mutual friends, especially the ones I got close to in Spain. I decided to reach out to one of the Spain guys, I’ll call him Sam (18M) and check in. When he ignored that text, I decided to send him another asking him specifically if everything is okay between us.

  
I have a bad habit of catastrophizing, but this was shockingly the one time that the worst case scenario actually came true. He responded with pure hostility, saying I treated Ella “really terribly,” and even said “there is no way I, or any brother, or any father, would want their sister or daughter to be treated in the way you treated Ella.” This was utterly terrifying for me to read, especially because I genuinely did not know what it is that I’d done that could warrant this kind of language, and it sent me into a panic attack that lasted basically the rest of the day. And in a later message, he even implied that I would not want the things I’ve done to be made publicly aware, which is also a terrifying thing to hear, but I retorted that there is absolutely nothing that I’ve done that falls under that category, and I mean that sincerely.

  
Sam and I continued to have a back-and-forth for much of that day. My entire intent was just to get him to have a phone call with me, so I could understand what it is I’d done, but also to have a chance to defend myself and reassure him that I’m not a terrible person. Also, text is a terrible mode of communication for topics like this anyway. I was forceful at times, but I was still respectful, and I made it clear to him that I had no ill will towards Ella, and I was fully committed to having a productive and respectful conversation, and that at the very least, I deserve to know what my mistakes are so that I can learn from them.

  
But he outright refused, saying things like “I don’t need an explanation from you, and I don’t need you to address any of this,” and “I know the whole story,” and “I know how it went down, I’ve read the texts,” and “I do not want to try to come to an understanding on any of these issues.” I include all of these quotes because I am frankly appalled by this attitude, especially from someone I once considered a friend. He repeated over and over that I was not to bother or pester or communicate with Ella at all, and said things like “I will protect Ella fiercely,” and “I am willing to defend Ella to the end,” as though I am some kind of threat, even though I have had no intention of interacting with her except to swap some of our items. And finally, he told me I was not to reach out to any of our friends (he listed them by name) about “any of this.”

  
Having said all of that to me, though, he still never told me anything specific about what I have supposedly done. I racked my brain trying to think of what he could possibly be talking about, and I was terrified that I might have done something that could be classified as unconsensual or even worse. Ella and I were physical while we were in Spain, but we never had full intercourse, and everything we DID do, I sought her consent for. So I just don’t know what he could be talking about.

  
I’m generally a somewhat anxious person, but this has undeniably been one of the most stressful ordeals of my life, and it makes a solid contender for the #1 spot.

  
It’s been over two days now since Sam sent his last message, and I ultimately decided that it would not be productive to try to engage him further, so I just left him on read. Talking to friends, family, and my therapist has helped me not catastrophize so much, and they have been fairly reassuring.

  
But now, the rest of the cards are starting to fall. Since this interaction with Sam, he has now blocked me on WhatsApp and Instagram. Ella has now done the same. I texted two of our mutual friends from the Spain group to ask them for their thoughts on the things Sam had said to me; one of them left me on read, and the other just blocked me there and on Instagram. Even one of Ella’s friends who I only interacted with a handful of times has blocked me on Instagram. Other than Sam, not a single one of them has said a word to me. And the girl who left me on read is now the only person from my Spain friend group who hasn’t blocked me.

  
That’s where things stand, and where they will likely stay. After I return to the States, I will be on campus at the same time as them for at most a week and a half before I graduate, and then they will be out of sight, out of mind. It’s unavoidable that I will have to interact with Sam because he and I are in the same fraternity (some brotherhood, I know), but he said he would be “amicable in social settings” with me.

  
I am just shocked and appalled, and somewhat scared for the future. I have never been treated with so much vitriol and condemnation. I’ve never had such awful things said to and about me, especially not from someone I respected. I’ve never been so adamantly denied any opportunity for communication and systematically shut out from a friend group that I helped create. And part of me is genuinely afraid of the things they will say about me once I have graduated and am unable to defend myself. Occasionally I get a flash of just how ridiculous this situation is, that everyone’s behaving so middle school-y and that I’m basically taking orders from an 18 year old who only knows half the story. But I still am gravitating more towards fear and anxiety. It’s a shitty situation.

  
If you’ve read this whole thing, thank you so much. Empathy from anonymous strangers is a beautiful thing. I definitely went into too much detail, but writing my thoughts out has been therapeutic.

  
TL;DR My ex girlfriend and I had a necessary but ugly breakup. I texted a mutual friend and asked where we stood, and he responded hatefully and vaguely threateningly, without telling me why. Now he, my ex, and all of our mutual friends are blocking me on text and social media with no explanation at all.

We didn't have sex, but we just laid there, holding each other. This was my first time cuddling with someone.

Oh. My. God. It was so amazing. Just to have someone lay next to you like that. I have never experienced so much euphoria. I couldn't believe someone so pretty and so nice was cuddling with me. I felt like the luckiest guy in the world. It so special when you're sort of intertwined with a person (I don't know how to put it in words that don't sound raunchy). We fell asleep, and every time I half woke up, she was still there, holding me, as I was holding her.

Thee_Wifeyy,I'm struggling with religion,3,1c5pyd6,15,"I’m only 16, and have been brought up in a very Christian household my entire life. My life has always been a mess and chaotic. I’m not sure how to structure this rant because there are many factors and events that occurred for me to get here. Easter had really made me think.

  
My mother and father are very strong believers in God. Everything they do is for God & because of God. They are no longer together because my dad is a terribly abusive man (physically, mentally & financially) & to this very day he still continues to torment us. Although my entire family follows the Christian faith, I’d say only my mom takes it seriously. Everyone else would be considered lukewarm, even my grandparents. I go to a private, Christian all-girls school & basically everyone (except for say 2 girls) is Christian. On top of that, the country I live in is very much a majority Christian country (above 85%)

  
My faith in God has wavered for as long as I can remember. I’ve always had questions about this religion even from when I was 8. I knew of Jesus Christ. I never felt like I knew him. I’ve always felt like I’m following this religion only because I’m obligated to & as of recently, I’m starting to crack.  
Back in 2020 when I was 13, I tried telling my mom that I thought I might be atheist. She immediately dismissed this, told me there was no such and basically forced me to go back to church and participate in daily devotion. This only made me regret telling her and now I just act. I act interested but I’m not. I act like I believe all of this, but I don’t. I act like I love being Christian but I don’t. It irritates me!

  
Back to my father, I’m convinced that out of all his children he hates me the most due to me being the only child who stands up to him. He’s constantly tormenting, insulting me & manipulating me. He always weaponises the bible & uses bible verses to justify his abuse. But this man is literally demonic. He’s not a good person and I hate him with every bit of my heart. So when I think of the bible, I think of him & get triggered.

  
I dislike church. Usually I never want to be there, some people there make me uncomfortable but it doesn’t matter. I always wonder what the difference between church and a cult is. It’s a very fine line & at some point I feel like we’ve crossed it.

  
When I sit in chapel/church and listen, I just get angry. Angry at everything that is being said & because of my upbringing, I can’t help but think that I might have the devil in me. I feel trapped in this faith. I’m tired of pretending. This faith is starting to make me hate myself. I feel like I’m a bad person, like I’m demonic and I’m not good enough because I am not on the same level as the “true” believers.

  
The only reason why I have hung on so long is because I am afraid of the day of judgement & being banished to hell. It’s the only reason I stay. But apparently that isn’t enough too. Surely God knows that this relationship I have with him is superficial? So what’s the point? I must be going to hell regardless then. I feel so lost.",1713298181.0,

soft_milkii,I miss my boyfriend but I hate it.,4,1c5px8j,1,"We are in an ldr and its now 2 weeks ago since he left and i miss him.
I miss his smell, his lips to kiss...
The memories dont leave my mind, especially our kisses. 
I miss it when he did this thing that meant he wants a kiss. I miss making out with him. I miss his hands around my throat and when he pushed me into the mattress. I miss sitting on his lap and giving him hickeys. I miss when he went down on me, cause nothing will feel as good as that. I also miss that his hands won't replace my bra again.

Even though he didn't take care of my needs, except that one time I miss him. And it feels horrible to miss him despite that. Because what if he will still put his needs first the next time?
I hate it. I hate that he is the only thing that can get me in the mood, but also turns me off cause he didn't keep his word. Really, fuck him for that.

Despite it all, I miss him. And I hate that I won't see him for good 3-4 months now...

Ive had some kisses with girls at parties just cause but nothing beyond that, but recently I have started to develop like a sexual tension or platonic love towards this girl at work (she is gay), I believe its because she has a strong male like energy but this attraction its becoming more intense every day, and its crazy cause is not like I want a serious relationship but there definitely an attraction. We are good friends, but is a weird feeling, I was hoping it just went away but it hasn't. Just wanna get rid of the way I feel specially since we work together as well. I cant stop thinking about her but is not like I want a relationship but maybe just be intimate. I dont know its very confusing, I never felt like this before.

octobermidnight,Have you ever felt sadness and anger,1,1c5xyll,1,"I'm honestly annoyed. A mixed of anger, hatred, sadness, and disappointment. I met this girl August 2022 at a time in my life where everything was changing. I thought I had met who I was destined to. Everything about our meeting was divine. Her reaction towards me was, ""are you an angel?"" Yeah... so shy she would freeze when I would poke her. Our talks were endless and refreshing to the soul.  I learned she was a single mom, divorced in 2016. She never told me what who or when. She thought I was just a test, a lesson to be learned. We kept talking, because we were roommates so it was inevitable. I told her one night, what is she afraid of, she says she's not meant for relationships. Anyway, we kept on... And we had an official date of our relationship January 28th.  I should mention I'm female, 26 years old, and she was 43. 

I'm annoyed I won't go into further details but she always hesitated, always questioned me, always had doubts....  I eventually learned that she was married to this guy for 6 years and total relationship 12 years. I rolled my eyes. Had I known that, I would've treaded more carefully. Everything I did she disliked, it was always dissected, she was always accusing me of doing wrong. 

She moved back to the phillipines July 2023 because she felt ""alone"" in the states. She said she has always wanted to do it so whether I was in the pic or not, she had to go. Yea we cried, yea we loved. She had alot of battles within.  

Anyway, long distance was what it was. Both of our minds played their tricks and now we have decided or atleast SHE did that its time to end. That she needs to focus on bettering her life and her situation. 

I'm so angry because I feel this all has to do with her divorce. The few details she gave me were that he was full of himself, was always out doing his run hobby and he ""forget his family"" That she felt excluded. So how adorable... that it wasn't infedility but rather she loved him so much she wanted him home. I'm angry. 

Why couldnt she try to love again? Why. Why. Why not move on? Why destroy your life for one person, why not try life again with me? I'm a different person, I'm not them nor would she want me to be. 

She always stated it had nothing to do with that and why would she go back to a situation God put her out of. She always said to stop bringing her past up but it's all I saw. I saw old pics of them smiling, I never saw her smile that big with me.

I need some serious advice. I'm like basically going crazy, I feel like I'm Jay Gatsby where he has been in love with that girl and tries to work on himself for years to impress her in the end, I literally cannot get this person out of my head no matter what I do. Any song, any stranger, the grass, the city lights, the water, reminds me of them. I've known them since we were in middle school and I've had the biggest most gigantic crush on them ever since. We've hung out so many times and we keep sort of in touch to this day, and I am so confused as to why I still have a crush on them. It's been entire years!!!!!! A decade or more !!!

Three years ago we kissed on New Years, and we almost were intimate but the person was in a relationship and we stopped midway. They went abroad for college so we barely ever hung out, but when I saw them again it was always so nice

Nowadays they're too busy to bother with me I guess because they work so much and also one city away, I've messaged them on social media and they've asked me to hang out when I'm in the area, they mentioned they miss me which literally made my heart jump. Problem is I have a sort of relationship I'm not really in, one that is not going great at all and we are broken up but the situation is complicated tbh. Point is that I am basically officially single but hanging with this friend would still be weird. We like sort of live together idk.

When I was in highschool I really took in the idea that interest was creepy, that I essentially had to wait for someone to like me and give me permission. Had anyone said that to me? No way, but just seeing so much content about how annoying and gross people are perceived made me get this warped idea of what was acceptable. 

And since then I've grown, ive had a relationship, things move on. But still in the back of my mind is the gestalt of all these voices telling me what to do and what not to do, and they all conflict.

maybenotexisting,i have no idea what to do with my life anymore after my friends left me.,1,1c5xbxo,0,"**trigger warning for self harm, sexual abuse, child abuse, and other stuff similar to that**

i (15f) have no idea what to do with my life after my friends left me. for a little bit of background, i have bpd, autism, ptsd, anxiety, anorexia and depression (all diagnosed) and i have issues with suicidal ideations and self harm. i have been sexually, verbally, emotionally, and physically abused by many people (including my father) and have been groomed and sexually assaulted multiple times.   
i’ll call my friends james (17m), nathan (15m), alice (20f), and sal (17m) ((not their real names at all)). i knew both sal and alice irl, while james and nathan were online friends. in early 2023, i was being groomed by alice and was sexually abused by her from when i was 10 to when i was 13. we met through my brother, and we were very close for about two years until she started to repeatedly sa me and fetishize my s/h habits. she manipulated me into believing james was a groomer and a horrible person for two years, and in mid 2023 i got back into contact with him again after moving in with my mom. 

i only moved in with my mom because my dad, who was an abusive drug user and alcoholic, attempted to killed himself in front of me and my brother. my mother is much better than my father, and is in no way abusive. me and my 17 year old brother lived on our own for about a week until my mom was able to drive across the country to take us in. my father traumatized me and abused me and all of my siblings sexually, emotionally, verbally, and physically. most of my siblings were kicked out at 14-16 and sent to live with my mom. he would beat our pets until they would literally die, and leave their bodies in our house for us to dispose of. he also neglected us and wouldnt feed me for weeks me for being 'overweight' (i was \~90 pounds and 5'8). i also had no idea how to cook and was terrified of stoves from him slamming my hands onto the stove, giving me burns. my brother also had no idea how to cook for similar reasons.   
me and nathan were romantically involved around this time and were up until april first of this year. we planned to spend our entire lives together and get married. in november of 2023, i met a guy at my school named sal. sal was very romantic with me and sexually assaulted me more than once, and moved to a different state about two months after. sal harassed me online for weeks and publicly posted my address (i’m a pretty popular person in a small community on youtube, i won’t disclose which community for privacy reasons) and posted my nudes multiple times. sal and nathan got into an argument and nathan somehow managed to get sal to leave me alone.   
on march 23rd of this year, i attempted suicide and only wrote a note to one person, nathan. i only wrote a note to him because he was my fp at the time. in this note, i only talked about stuff nathan had done that made me feel lonely and bad about myself. a few weeks ago, james told nathan something i specifically asked him to not tell anyone. james also told nathan i lied about him being my boyfriend, which i admittedly did do. i was emotionally unstable and i have no idea why i lied about that. they both talked to me about it and nathan told me he felt like he couldn’t trust me anymore, and i apologized as much as i could.   
after this, i began talking to sal again. nathan and james found out and told me they felt like everything they were doing to help me wasn’t doing anything. i got upset at them and i said a lot that i regret significantly. neither of them believe sal is actually a real person, and believe i lied about being abused and bullied. james told me he understood what it felt like to have a parent harm themselves in front of you and made me feel better about it.   
recently, james and nathan both blocked me. neither of them would tell me what i did but they keep calling me a weirdo, a liar, a creep, and said i was just like alice. i tried to kill myself again because i had no idea what to do and i was voluntarily institutionalized for a week. i told my mom about everything that happened and she told me she’s struggled with the stuff i’ve struggled with, and even with her support i have no idea what to do. i have talked to my therapist more than once, and she isn’t really helping either. all of my friends knew how mentally ill i am and knew how what they were doing was affecting me. i have no one else to talk to and i have no clue what to do. i feel like my life is over. i want to become a zoologist or an author, but i feel like i won’t make it that far. i have literally no idea how to take this and i have no one to talk to.

This wasn't the first time I went through something like that medically speaking, I had done it the first time 2014-2015.  
  
I am good at what I do, really good, but because almost all of my experience is in defense, no other industry is seemingly willing to look at me and no minimum wage positions here want someone that they believe wont immediately leave for a better paying job nor do they want someone that is as admittedly overeducated and overqualified as me.

I can't get the MRI's I require every 6 months to monitor for aneurysms.  
  
I dont qualify for disability especially because I have no problem working if the job is in an office setting. I have been selling what little I have to pay for my cell phone bill and storage unit down in texas since I couldn't afford to bring it all back to Indiana. I have basically nothing now. I can't afford to see pain management, I can't afford any THC products (which they simply mask my pain rather than kill it, I still feel the pressure from the pain). I can't even afford to get a fucking haircut! My family has shown me time and time again that I can't rely on them except for the bare minimum and even then, it's not without being told all the things I have done wrong despite having done more, having accomplished more than any of them at my age.  
  
Realistically... it would have been best had I not woken from surgery. I'm not going to have a family, I wont subject any child to go through what I have medically. My friends wish they could help but there's nothing any of them can do since none of them went any direction close to mine and so have no connections that can help.

It should provide a safe harbor, not sow confusion, anger, or sorrow. You deserve certainty, a grace in your life.  
You deserve a bond that reminds you that love is always tender. You truly deserve a love that flows effortlessly. While relationships demand effort and endure trials, love should always be gentle. It shouldn't fracture but fortify, an organic extension of yourself, tender, kind, and hopeful.  
You deserve love at your worst. Life's trials can be daunting, but you deserve someone who stands by you, through storms and celebrations alike. It's that simple. You deserve to be loved in the manner you love others, and you deserve to believe in love's existence.

Odd_Tangerine4641,Having insecure thoughts in my relationship of 4 years,1,1c5x3oc,0,"So my bf (26M) and I (25F) have been together for almost 4 years now. We’ve started to live together after 4 months of dating due to money and quarantine (not something we really wanted to do at the time). Last year we moved to a house near his family but away from my only friend and we’re in an extremely small town. At Christmas, I decided to leave due to neglect and just tired of begging for him to try harder. He’s been doing better since we talked it through and our sex life got better for a short time. 

Recently, he started a new job and we’ve been doing better financially. I thought this would help and he’d want to do more with me since he’s not home all day and we aren’t wondering if we will have enough to pay bills. A few weeks in one of his friends GF asked me if he had taken me out since he started the job and I said no. I was about to go mow our half acre yard with a push mower by myself. She asked if he was helping and when I said no she called him lazy. This last week his mom said the same thing and it hurts. I try to defend him but it’s hard when I’ve done all the work to make sure we pay bills and kept the house up. 

I started thinking about our future and if it will ever happen. I mention marriage and he says he wants to but we can’t afford it. We don’t go out with each other and I feel like there’s no adventure. Our sex life is iffy and I feel like I’m begging him to touch me half the time. I worry I’m going to wake up one day and feel regret for trying to make it work. I’m so tired of feeling this way. I’ve gained about 60 lbs in this relationship and don’t feel good about myself anymore. When I ask him he says I’m beautiful but that’s about the only thing I hear. I’ve been in therapy for this and mentioned couples therapy for our communication issues but sometimes I feel like this is more than just communicating.

Right now the cone and the wobbly legs are the biggest challenge. He’s going to fight that cone like crazy once he comes to! I am so thankful to everyone who commented such nice, thoughtful words of advice and encouragement. We have an adventure ahead of us but I am more confident that he is going to be a happy, pain free boy in the near future! 


I still can’t believe this is happening. We noticed his eyes were looking a little weird a couple months ago but my regular  vet said she didn’t see anything to worry about. It seemed to get worse so my husband made an appointment with an animal eye specialist. That appointment was on Saturday and while I was prepared for bad news, I didn’t know it would be devastating. He has glaucoma in both eyes and his lenses have fallen out of place, he is blind and in a lot of pain so our only fair option for him is to have them both removed. This was 48 hours ago and now he’s at the clinic for his surgery. 

I am so scared. I’m scared he won’t adjust well and he will be scared. I’m scared of what he’s going to look like which feels so selfish. I am completely overwhelmed and shattered this is happening to him. I am just so terrified. He’s such a sweet boy and I would do anything for him. This just sucks. ",1713212330.0,
TFD436,Watching a family die in a car accident,60,1c55k2a,2,"I’m a Paramedic. A few years ago (pre Covid) My partner and I transported a Chest Pain patient to a PCI hospital in our area, meaning we drove a little farther than the ER we normally drop people off too. Because our patient was having a Heart Attack (STEMI), the documentation was a little more in depth than normal. We decided to raid the EMS Room for snacks, pull out of the Ambulance Entrance to make room, and park a little farther down on hospital property while I finished my chart so I could restock my drugs and head back to the station. 

While we were sitting in the truck, a family with two super excited little girls walked past and waved at us. They both had medical glove balloon animals with sharpie faces and one had a glove filled with ice. She told us that she accidentally put her finger in a moving wheelchair wheel and got her finger smashed. We turned the lights on, making them smile and telling each other how cool our Ambulance was. I got out and asked them if they wanted to see the inside of the truck. They climbed into the back and my partner showed them the equipment while their parents told me they were here visiting their grandmother, who was brought in by ambulance. 

These girls were elated to see the truck. We let them ride the Auto Loader, turn the lights on, see the fridge in the back, and to round out the adventure they got to turn on the siren for a few seconds. The parents then said let’s go get some food and we watched the little family then got into a minivan near where we were parked and leave the parking lot. I finished my chart, got my drugs restocked, and we hit the road. We were about 5 blocks from the freeway that would take up back to our side of the City. 

As we got to the light to make a left to the freeway, we see the minivan sitting right ahead of us and the little girls in the back of the van waving excitedly at us. We both got onto the on ramp, and we passed them on the left as the lane merged. I watched the girls move from the back to the side of the van, waving and smiling the whole was as we passed. This is a 5 lane, sunken freeway. As we got even with the drivers door, the dad waved and mom mouthed, “thank you.” 

My partner started yelling, “woah, woah, woah, shit.” I looked up just in time to see a drunk driver coming down the off ramp, into the sunken freeway, and hitting the family head on. They were all looking at me waving back and didn’t see the car. The rear of their car hit the back of our ambulance, causing us to jerk to the right and across two lanes of traffic. We narrowly avoided the wall of the freeway. 

Saving the gory details, neither of the girls were buckled and were killed on impact. The mother was also killed on impact. The dad died while being extricated from the vehicle. The drunk driver walked away basically unscathed. 

I don’t work in this city anymore. My old Captain retired and I came back for his retirement party yesterday. I drive past the spot. The spot that gave my nightmares. I still remember the excited smiles and wish we wouldn’t have waved back and entertained and interacted with them so much. They might still be here if not for me causing a distraction and waving.

,i crossed a line in our friendship,1,1c5wwaz,3,"Today my friend (20F) gave me (19F) her blue jacket because I was cold. For background, I began thinking of her in a romantic way around 3 months after we became friends, but I never acted on it because I don't want to ruin what we have. Currently, we've been friends for around a year. I've never seen her in a sexual way, I genuinely love our conversations and her personality. The moment I put on her jacket I knew I was screwed. It was the smell. Her smell. I tried to ignore it all day, but her scent was all over me. Once it began to warm up, I tried to give it back, but she insisted I kept it. After this point, we go our separate ways home. This is where I go wrong. I don't know what came over me, but the smell was so intoxicating. I had her jacket over my face and was taking puffs like a nicotine addict. I must've done that for at least five minutes, just breathing in her. One thing led to another and I was undoing my pants and you know what happened. 12/10 experience. Afterwards I felt incredibly guilty and I'm not sure how to face her now.",1713315983.0,

bigtaro_,Is this cheating?,1,1c5wmi7,1,"I matched with a girl on bumble (let's call her Sarah) and our first dates went quite well. We even kissed after meeting a couple times. It was wholly unexpected for me, but the thought of being more serious with each other was on the table from that point. Still, soon after, we hit a lot of trouble between each other, and we had a number of intense fights. Because of that, there were periods of time where we wouldn't talk to each other for days.

During one of these periods, I matched with another girl (let's call her Rachel) and spent a day with her. I have no romantic intentions towards Rachel; I met her because we were in a similar line of work involving social media and I was curious on how she managed things on her end. I was nice to Rachel, probably moreso than I was to Sarah. Maybe it was my work brain kicking in, but I'm not going to excuse myself from it.

I met Rachel for one day and I didn't exactly enjoy the day much at all, to the point where I wouldn't want to be business partners even if things came down to business exclusively between me and Rachel. I exchanged some final pleasantries with her by making sure she was home safely and that everything was fine, and cut contact with her afterwards.

Things between me and Sarah have improved since. Personally, I think the rough times even improved our relationship overall, because it gave us opportunities to be more open and honest about ourselves, including the ugly parts. It went so well, in fact, that we began dating and started a serious relationship together.

The question I have is: would the day I spent with Rachel be considered cheating?

I don’t really have anyone to talk about this with, so any input would be appreciated

I want to hear blood spill and squelch everywhere and take out their brain and play with it like slime. Doesn't matter who it is. I imagine myself being a surgeon, cutting through someone's chest for surgery but then I cut it too excessively just to see that blood spill out, and for them to die right there on the hospital bed.

Anonpls12,I (28f) smell bad and got publicly humiliated. Its ruining my life. ,1,1c5wjt3,6,"Ive been having this problem for about a year and i didn’t realize how bad it’s been progressing. Ive been described as musty or shitty/fart smelling. Let me preface this by saying im clean and practice good hygiene and things haven’t always been like this. I started hearing whispering and comments at a new job that i smell. This is the first time i started hearing this from multiple people at once. I started to become really self conscious and obsessed over being as clean as humanly possible. I changed soaps, deodorants, laundry detergents, diet ect. In hopes to tackle this stench. I thought i had things under control. But then i took a flight and fuck everyone said it smelled horrible and i know they were talking about me. I fell into a deep depression and lost my job after that trip. I applied  for medicaid to see a doctor about this and still waiting to be approved. Anywho, i bought concert tickets before i knew how bad this was, and the day finally came. My siblings dragged me out bc i haven’t left my house in over a month. Ive been religiously taking chlorophyll drops and showering twice a day, thinking i should be good to go! Nope. I went and about 10 minutes in the comments start rolling in. And then people start realizing its me. This one girl kept pushing me back and spraying a bunch of perfume. Everyone was migrating away from me. Another girl very loudly and indirectly complained about me to her friend “really could’nt even shower before coming?”. All the whispering and disgusted looks had me shaking with anxiety. That same girl scoffed ”she doesn’t even know any songs” but really i was having a panic attack and could’nt enjoy myself and sing along to one of my favorite artists. It was so humiliating, i ran out in tears. It’s so soul crushing bc music is my escape and going to concerts is one of my favorite things to do in this world. This has never EVER happed to me at a concert before. I usually make concert buddies, but this time no one could stand to be near me. That confirmed to me that i can never leave the house again until i figure out what the hell is happening to me. Its been making me very suicidal. Ive been wishing that if i do have some sort of disease it would just kill me already. I wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy.

Im so sorry this is a long babbly mess, Im not the best at writing. I dont need advice, i know i have to see a doctor.

I don't think I could handle losing you. And it's funny because we're not even the closest of friends or have known eachother for years. Yet somehow I couldn't imagine not being able to talk to you because I ruined it all with some dumb fantasy. You and her are cute together. I'm glad you finally have someone good for you. And I know I'm never gonna tell you any of this. But I am glad we're friends. And I'll stay just that as long as I can keep you in my life, even for just a little longer. I hope that in one universe I can truly believe I have any sort of chance with you. But then I'd still feel sorry for her because I know it could never happen, no matter what universe.

jaaddee23,I have become chronically online and I hate it. ,1,1c5w90e,0,"A couple months back I started getting into reading. From this reading, I got into looking up  fan art and theories online. From there I starting liking peoples posts. Then I started actually FOLLOWING them. I put that in caps because for me I used to nevelike the fandoms enough to follow them. I would look it up here and now but not consistently. From there I started, dare I say it, COMMENTING. And it turned out, other people liked and agreed with my opinions cause I would get a decent amount of likes. 

And it felt pretty damn good. 

I started commenting more and more, and then I started interacting with people. For me, that was lunacy. I never posted on instagram or Facebook when I was younger, I still don’t now. I have zero posts on instagram. Granted I’ve only had it for about 8 years and got it in college. Most people have had them since like middle school now. I didn’t have a tiktok or go on twitter(X) much at all except the Super Bowl.

I started checking my activity on instagram every 5 minutes. Then every five seconds. I just got addicted to reloading my screen over and over. Then I went to the next level. Tumblr.

I had a tumblr before but didn’t use it. I occasionally looked up stuff about books I liked just like I did on instagram and that’s it (I find tumblr much easier to search on. Insta had an update recently where you can’t look up stuff and filter to latest, so now you can only see stuff that’s top aka super popular and you’ve already seen before? I want to see smaller artists and accounts too.) Anyways.

I started following and liking things on tumblr. I didn’t post anything. And my account was literally just the basic set up they give you I just typed in random letters as my user name. But the thing about tumblr is there’s not a big commenting culture, at least for the fandom stuff I was looking up. It wasn’t hitting that satisfying feeling I was craving when I got a like on instagram. I couldn’t obsessively refresh and refresh for likes unless I actually posted something myself, and I wasn’t ready for that. So I thought what’s that addictive platform that people always talk about where you can have long chains and chains of commenting and liking?

Reddit. 

So I made a Reddit and damn was my world opened. So many different subs, so many different things to talk about and waste my time commenting on. At first I just liked stuff, then I started the commenting on fandom related things. Instagram all over again. Sitting there just reloading and reloading that screen for likes. I started writing drafts in my notes, afraid to ever actually post them. I had seen people get hate on Reddit before and was scared lol. So I started on a platform where you can’t dislike anything and posted on tumblr. 

And it was splendid. Some comments, some reblogs, some likes. Not a lot but I felt good about it. For that validation kick. So I decided to go to a wider audience on Reddit. That was a mistake.

I quickly realized how much faster you reach an audience on Reddit, and how much wider of an audience you can reach. I started getting a ton of likes, a ton of comments. I only posted in the fandom specific ones at first, but then I started branching out to random ass subs and threads and commenting on posts in all those.  

I would literally reload my screen all day. All day. This is a problem because I am work from home. I would keep it open to the activity page and reload and reload and reload. Idk what it is, because when I’m replying or posting stuff I’m not thinking about the likes or anything, I’m honestly like idc how many likes or comments it gets I just want to get my opinion off my chest (hehe, *off my chest*). But then once I post it I can’t step checking. It’s become like a reflex, an impulse. It’s so fucking annoying and a problem because as stated, I am work from home. So I have to keep myself accountable to get my work done. 

Cut til today, I literally got in a fight with someone. Or at least we were being sassy towards each other. I feel so.. ashamed? Like an internet fight? With a person I don’t know about who the fuck cares? 

So I’m done. I have spiraled so far out of control down the hole of online gratification that I have receded in basic adult maturity. This is my good bye, at least until I find my dignity again after letting the internet consume me. I am deleting the app. Hopefully I will never see any of the likes or comments on this post lol.",1713314142.0,

I hate him for the things he put us through and for the big part he played in my mental health struggles but I understand now as I’ve gotten older that he also suffered the majority of his life due to undiagnosed and untreated mental illness. He became an alcoholic trying to self medicate, which I currently do now (Just not as bad). I wish I could of told him that the things he exposed me to caused me to suffer most of my adult life. PTSD, depression & anger issues all stimming from childhood trauma of being the child of an alcoholic. I get why he was the way he was but it’s no excuse to abandoned FOUR children. I wanna tell him that he left us at such a crucial time in my life (15) and that’s when I needed him to start showing me how to be a man, start a family and career and that him not doing so has made me have to teach myself with no good examples of how to be one and I continually feel like a failure as a husband & father (my wife continually tells me I’m such a great father for not having an example on how to be one for most of my life) I know I’m rambling but I’m confused, sad and pissed tf off at the same time.

And dang it, being adopted sucks. 

I love my family, I do. But waking up every morning that my biological father was not even present, and my biomom didnt even glance at me. That shit is hard. On top of that, I have a biological half sibling, which means im not the first mistake to come out of her. I was born months early, I dont even know what health issues I could develop, I have cerebral palsy (thankfully not a bad case) and it is AWFUL to live life never having a familiar face around you. That and knowing you started this life being pushed away. Some people wont get it, and some people are gonna say ""oh but you were chosen""...I was second pick. Somedays I really wish this b*** had aborted me. Life is so damn lonely.

And about those doors opening and closing. Yeah thats a lie to.

My life has been dedicated to sports. So to my past selfs surprise, thanks to good for nothing doctors and a shitty coach, my knee is ruined. Ive gained weight, loss all my muscle, cause I can hardly use my left knee. Basketball was my dream, and that door was shut on me. And basketball was my fall back, before that it was music. And I dont even want to revisit that traumatic experience. Now im trying to be a teacher and even that feels wrong...it doesnt make me happy like basketball and music have...

I hate being here, I hate life, I hate being ""one of a kind""...I live life feeling like a good for nothing. My parents are successful, my brother is married and happy and doing very well...I can hardly get out of bed to pass my freshmen year classes of college. Yippee

I’m taking back control of my life. I was upset when I learned that you’ve moved on, but now I’m not. In a way I am happy for you. I tried my best, I really did. And maybe that wasn’t enough- and that’s okay. I hope they are someone who can be a good partner to you. Would I love to hate fuck you? Yes. Would I love to sit down and talk about our entire relationship in excruciating detail and with honesty? Yes. Ultimately what I care about the most, is that you are well. However that may look like. 

I backed out of a date over the weekend. It felt wrong. I haven’t moved on, and that will come with time. Hell, it’s been nearly 3 months now so I hope I’d move on too. I am working on myself. I’m investing in myself and my future. I am doing well. The best I can do. 

You always said “do the best you can with the time you have.” That stuck. For much of my life, I didn’t try at all. Whether it was anxiety, fear, depression- whatever the reason, I just didn’t try. I can say with confidence, I have been trying. Trying so hard, and sometimes failing. That’s a part of life, failure. And it’s really not even about the failure, it is about how quickly can you bounce back from it.

So maybe you were able to bounce back quickly. I wasn’t. That’s okay. I’m working through things. In a metaphor, you are a falling tennis ball, and I am a falling basketball. Different recovery rates is all.

Comfortable_Two2925,I'm addicted to working,1,1c5vdrc,0,"I'd like to get something off my chest quickly. I began my self-improvement journey about two years ago. I started playing football, lifting weights five times a week, adopted a very clean diet, began reading books, and started practicing holistic meditation. Over the past two years, I've accomplished a lot. I was selected for the all-region First Team offensive and defensive line and achieved a 4.0 GPA. I also received a Division 2 offer to play football. I'm currently the happiest I've ever been, but simultaneously, I find it difficult to unwind and relax. Whenever I attempt to relax, I hear a voice in the back of my head calling me weak and telling me I should be doing more. This feels like a double-edged sword because while it prevents me from being lazy, it also stops me from enjoying my free time. I can't recall the last time I truly lived in the moment while spending time with my friends or family.  
  
People assume I have it all—an amazing future ahead of me, which is true. However, I don't have many memories of having fun. I love playing football; it's very dear to me. But I don't really connect well with any of my teammates. They don't put in the same effort as I do, and I find it challenging to befriend someone who isn't as dedicated as I try to be.

SeaMathematician140,My parents... ,1,1c5v6ek,0,"My parents, whoa, boy how parents mould young people into adults without them even thinking about whether what their doing will have a long lasting impact or not.

My father was abusive to me and my siblings growing up, my mother separated from him when I was 8 but we still went to see him on weekends. There was emotional, physical and financial abuse from my father, also now I'm well into adulthood and my father has never given us gifts for special occasions nor showed up to any sport, or extra curricula activities. I won't go into details of what he did to us but it was traumatising. 

Then there's my mother. She never remarried or got seriously involved with anyone else after her and my dad separated. She's always worked hard to provide for us, but she was largely emotionally unavailable. Then the 2 men she did get involved with are married. And she seen the first one for years and even had a child with him, after he stopped seeing her she started seeing another married man which has been going on for years. She doesn't seem to be able to form healthy attachments and has often said things like ""I don't know why you kids say you need your partners, I've been alone for a long time now and I'm fine"". 

Now I'm grown and looking at my mothers behaviour, it appalls me, and I understand some people believe that monogamy isn't for them and that a polyamorous lifestyle better fulfills their needs and nobody should be judged for that, but the majority of the population are monogamous and that should be respected too. 

I love my partner with my whole heart, and I'm not proud to admit but I fucked up 8 years ago. I didn't do anything physically, but I broke trust by sending some text messages. This broke my heart, I do have some personal reasons I did this but they are not an excuse and I own up to these actions. I will never again be as selfish as to destroy someone by betraying them. I often wonder if I wasn't shown that some people think it's ok to disrespect a commitment I would have taken a healthier approach in my moment of lapsing judgement. 

She's not going to see this as she doesn't use reddit and this is a throwaway of mine but.

Baby I am so sorry that I was selfish enough to make an attempt to step out, there is no reason good enough to make you feel what I have made you feel. I love you the most out of anything else in this world. ",1713311206.0,
MediumSizedBattery,I feel like an a-hole.,1,1c5v641,0,"I shouldnt even been on here, but i deadass have nobody to say this too, alright so- my mom set me up for some playmate gig and i didnt mind it, i was okay with it. But since girl im a playmate for is pretty high ranking..she had hella nannies around her, like alot. There was 2 nannies that specially wanted to make my life a living hell, one of them was named “Lilian” and she was one hell of a nanny, from falsing accusing me for things i havent done to blatantly lying to the girls mom that i tried to “bully” her. Anyway, there was this time where the girl and me got so close that she wanted to bring me to everywhere she went, i didnt mind, because usually the places she’d bring me to ended up being amazing.

There was this nanny, i wont say her name for privacy reasons yet i unironically gave out Lilian’s name. But whatever, that nanny had a husband who was a driver for the girl i was a playmate for, and last week friday she asked me to go with her somewhere, i agreed and the nanny who was suppose to come with me and the driver to be sent off in the area said “it would be better if she went now, (the girl im a playmate now has a name, mimi!) mimi will be waiting for her.” So my mom trusted this driver and we set off, one of the other nanny who was there prior to me and the driver leaving told me to sit in the front, i like sitting in the front, so i said sure.

I have no idea when it started, but the driver asked to hold hands, i was stupid and said “okay” because i thought it was fine, there was periods on where he asked if he could kiss me, on my lips and hands. Which i didnt agree on, i just had to tell him kiss somewhere for him to stop, i told him he could kiss me on my cheek, which he did. Like minutes after that, he groped my thigh, i told him to stop it, and his response? “Just touch, its okay.” He said it as if it was normal, i hated it. He tried to touch my cl¡t too, the worst part is when i got to my mom i told my brothers first, not her. Which upset her heavily, because he just took advantage of me and the first person i told was my BROTHERS.

For privacy reasons ill call the driver R, and his wife E (she will be needed later on). During the time when i told my mom, E was there, i kept crying, i couldn’t directly get it out. Eventually i did, i said “Ma, R sexually assaulted me.” And E happened to hear it, she was like “What?” In the “no way” voice. Me,my mom and E went to R and E was asking R what he did to me, R was looking confused and my mom kept shouting at him, E and R spoke in indonesien (R is Indonesien AND Muslim, E can speak Indonesien and converted to Islam) and R was saying that he didn’t understand what was going on, They talked for abit more and E said to me “C (my initial), he was just treating you like his daughter.” Goddamn, thats where i felt like i was an asshole. My mom, was defending me constantly, like she did not care.

It got so bad to the point where mimi’s mom had to talk to R,E and my mom, the nanny who told me to go with R alone (ill call her J) was defending me and my mom too. Goated, anyway, prior to this (which i feel like shouldve gotten added earlier) when me and R was still in the car, he told me to “not picture, secret okay?”. And i shouldve added this earlier, but when it was just me, Lilian and E, E tried to make me feel like an asshole (and it worked). She showed me pictures of her niece, saying he just wanted to treat me like her, and that She (E) and R just saw me as their daugther, because from what i know, E is infertile and can’t give birth, anyway the final blow that made me cry back to my mother was “i thought you were different, you just want attention”. - E. 

I know its pretty stupid, i dont know why i feel like an asshole, my brothers say that i got sexually assaulted and theyre just trying to guilt trip me, i know they wanted to do that, but i still have some part of me, like 15% that thinks im the a-hole and i shouldnt have done it.",1713311182.0,

Brave-Type-9559,Co-parenting hell with abusive ex,2,1c5pihl,0,"I have four children ranging from ages 15 to 9 years old in age. The co-parenting relationship I have with their dad is tense at best. Its great when we comply with his instability and endless changes, but if we have any issue with his unwillingness to stick to the parenting plan or show up in a 50% capacity it creates issues.  
Two years ago he met a woman who has been antagonistic in an already rocky co-parenting relationship, they got evicted from his rental and then he moved out of area without court approval 1.5 hours away, and that created a number of issues. Then he began to refuse to return the children multiple times, with the last and final refusal he didn't return our kids after spring break and instead blocked me from their devices, and took them to an island and hid for 4 days, it required a court order and police to return them, and after our kids have flat out refused to see him at all. And because of the laws in my state, him living beyond 50 miles insulated them (& me) from any legal issue, even though we have been in custody litigation for 19 months now.   
Our court stuff was put on a freeze when he the courts in August he intended to move back within 30 days of that hearing, and they gave him 30 days, every hearing (monthly from August to March), for 8 months to do that, allowing him to relocate refusing to take into account any of the issues above.   
In March his gf bought a house that was abandoned, needs heavy remediation, is completely under construction in every area, half of it has no electricity, bathrooms have no doors, bedrooms don't have doors, its in shambles. Because he is local again we are to resume 50/50 as though the last two years didn't happen while we wait for court to hear my reasons to modify the parenting plan. Which include the refusing to return them after that spring break, plus our eldest running away from him because of abuse at his house, he has been investigated by cps 11 times, has previously abandoned them off and on over the last 7 years, he is verbally, physically, and mentally abusive to them. Its just awful and again, because of the state I live in these issues are currently pending our upcoming court hearing.   
But yesterday, the ex filed a motion to push our next hearing out again, which our last hearing was in March where the judge intentionally pushed or next hearing out to the end of May in hopes of us finding middle ground on our own, she warned him of the many counts of contempt he could face, and said it is our responsibility to foster a healthy relationship for the children's sake but he refuses.  I have offered solutions and olive branches that he wont communicate back to. And with the children refusing visitation beyond what they seem suitable which is every other weekend it puts me in this awful position now that he is local again and the original parenting plan being what we are supposed to go off. The kids refuse to spend school weeks at his house because they said he cant get them to and from school, don't have their uniforms for school, doesn't have what they need, the condition of the house, and have asked him to stop pushing every other week, to just let them focus on school until the end of the year first. But he wont listen. He said forcing them and threatening to put me in jail for contempt is punishment for them not wanting to see him.  
I have called, text, emailed, and physically mailed this man solutions, I have offered  family counseling, offered for a family meeting, trying to encourage positive outcomes if he hears the kids out and just gives them this time, and that for him to consider their wishes might help their relationship as he has already deeply damaged his relationship with them. But I'm at a loss.  
When our children do see him he shows them all the court documents and talks to them about all the details, he talks badly about me nonstop, he is rewriting history, which all of it is really angering the kids even more. His girlfriend has involved herself talking about stuff she has no frame of reference on, and believing his lies. She talks poorly about me, threatens the kids, and gaslights them on their own life prior to her ever dating their dad. She has registered them for activities that she doesn't communicate that impact their time with me, she is paying for their stuff at school after I do and then telling our kids that I don't provide for them she does. I don't receive and child support, I mean their dad and girlfriend literally do nothing for these kids because wanting to force them to stay there. He refuses to take them to the doctor, any appointments, his gf takes them to and from school on the one week they did see him since he has been back, their dad works 2.5 hours away so they only see him on the weekend anyway. Its just all SOO unnecessary. I don't want anything from this man but to just leave our kids alone, and stop the drama and trauma.    
I'm not looking for legal advice but I'm just ugh!!!! Its such a nightmare and I'm so over it all.  I'm exposed legally by them refusing visitation. I hate being in the position I am because he is not the father he should be.   
Has anyone be through anything similar? Any words of support?   
Prior to this gf and him moving out of area, he rarely saw the kids, and our co parenting relationship wasn't terrible it wasn't easy either but he was never this bad. He didn't talk poorly or involve them in conflict, and he let them stay with me because they preferred it and it benefited him.

I'm a dude and when I was between the ages 17-22, I used to get my little brother who was between the ages 5-10 to sleep next to me.

It wouldn't be actual sleep, just light naps. He would come to me wanting something e.g the TV remote control. I would tell him he has to sleep beside me for a little if he wants it. He'd be reluctant and annoyed but would eventually agree

So I would lie in my bed and he'd be next to me. I'd be on my side and he'd usually be on his back. Sometimes I'd try and be the big spoon and cuddle him. He'd lie there frustratingly waiting for the 'nap' to be over and constantly ask if it's enough.

I would then let him go and give him whatever he came to get. Idk why I ever did this. It was nothing sexual, I've never gotten aroused by it or anything. I just liked having him there close to me especially since he was so adorable.

I'm sure he thought I was weird as hell. Looking back, that was fucking weird and I'm horrified that I ever did that. I feel like a pedophile even though I never touched him inappropriately or even thought of him in a sexual manner ever. I have also never been sexually attracted to kids or engaged in any pedophile behavior. But this one here might count idk

My sister hears a lot of this and gets mad at me for talking bad about our mom. My sister doesn't feel things that same as me (I oberthink things while she lets them roll off her back).

My mother (65) was let go from her job almost 2 years ago and decided that she was retired. She has been working on transferring her 401k to her own IRA account. She has been in contact with the benefits person from her previous employer and the company that they go through to have the plans.  She was told she needs to get a medallion signature to be able to transfer those funds. She called around and the only bank around us does the medallion signatures is Edward Jones.  She spoke to representative and they told her that she would have to have a savings account with them, for a minimum of two years, before they would provide that service to her.  Another family member told her they got one from Affinity Plus Credit Union. She refuses to call Affinity because she doesn't trust credit unions. She decided not to continue pursuing the quest for a medallion signature but has been complaining nonstop (for a year and a half) about how she has no access to her retirement funds. 

Her newest complaint is that her information was stolen during the AT&T data breach back in March. She spoke with my grandma, who had her identity stolen previously and my grandma told her all the things she did after to make sure that her credit and identity was safe. Step one was a credit freeze, step two was free credit monitoring, step 3 was getting Lifelock, and step four was report any suspicous use/misuse of her data. I looked up a couple articles online that had variations of those steps and have sent them to her. She told me that all of that sounded like too much work and she doesn't trust doing everything online since that was how her information was stolen in the first place. She finally called for a free credit report but opted not to do any monitoring. So now, I've been listening to her complain about how she doesn't trust anything online and expects her credit to be completely ruined. 

Our county offers various services to anyone over the age of 60. She has signed up to get new windows and siding for her house. People never got back to her about the forms and she never followed up either. She just complained about how they promised her a service and she didn't get it (they serve the whole county and we have a high elderly population). Her screen door was cracking over the winter and all she did was complain about how she has no one to help her fix it. She was going to call her brother to have him do it (he worked maintenence for a number of years) but didn't. She said he was too busy with his grandkids. I suggested she call the elder program and they would probably send someone over. She refused to do so and we still have a broken door. I offered to learn to fix it but she told she wanted it fixed right, which is a fair point.  I just wish she would call someone to help. I don't have any friends that could help us because they all live about 1.5 hours away from us.

She is a hoarder too and refuses to clean but gets mad at me when I do. I'm ""always throwing away her stuff"". All I have gotten rid of were childhood toys she never got rid of(1 bin out 8 done with her permission), my own clothes that don't fit anymore, and some old newspapers she was saving (I cut out the important articles/notices she saved the papers for). Anything sentimental I leave on a table for her to for through at her leisure. She has accused me of getting rid of bin full of her long-sleeved shirts. I had no idea what bin she was talking about (everything is in bins because that makes it more organized 🙄). She looked in two spots and then stopped because I must have gotten rid of them. She hasn't tried to look elsewhere (basement, her overstuffed closet, or the third bedroom that is overflowing with junk). She gets embarrassed when people come over (they rarely do) and claims we are in the middle of cleaning (spoiler alert we aren't). Family tell me that we need to clean the house but it's hard when my mom makes excuses for why we can't get rid of anything. She complains about not wanting to clean because she looks at everything and ""it is too overwhelming"".

I just wish my mom would take some action to better her situations, even if it hard or long. It would be better than doing nothing at all. She used to be so resilient and determined but she lost that part of herself. Now she basically acts like she is helpless.",1713308512.0,

I could frolic and walk around when I felt hyperactive.   I could jump over to an empty cube and kick my feet up when I felt tired of being cropped up in that office.  I could curse up a storm and nobody would hear it.  This was a good deal... until it was over.  A good 1.5 years worth of solitude.  Now I work in new building surrounded by sales people.  For the time being, I run to the basement and seclude myself in a conference room, but no idea how long that will last until I get called out.

enolan99,currently bleeding friends and suffering as a result,1,1c5u21o,0,"i'm currently nearing the end of my sophomore year of college. so much has changed this semester. and in general this past year. don't get me wrong, oftentimes change is for the better and it's a good thing. but change can be hard. 

the main thing on my mind is that i recently had a sort of ""friendship breakup"" with someone who i had been friends with for about a year and a half. it was sort of strange in the sense that no formal conversation was ever had in which it was made clear that we would no longer be friends, and no major hostilities ever occurred. it was just a gradual build up over time; we also had an argument or two over minor things. they're still BFFs with my ex-boyfriend (note that both individuals are of opposite sexes and one of them is gay), despite him and i having broken up five months ago. obviously i'm in no place to dictate who they can and cannot spend their time with, but after we broke up and they continued spending all their time over at his house, i knew there would be issues.

it especially sucks because we still live in the same dorm building together, and we have a lot of mutual friends. so i still have to see them somewhat often for the next few weeks.

at the tail end of my freshman year, i had a close friendship of mine implode. the friend in question abruptly lashed out at me one night over a relatively minor incident (it was clear that her frustration had steadily built up over time), and that next morning i woke up to a flurry of texts tearing into me and telling me how bad of a person i was. i thought we might be able to work through it, but to no avail. she was irreconcilable. it caused a lot of problems for me; i felt like the incident had revived my trust issues. how could someone i had been so close with the whole year turn on me so suddenly and completely?

now the summer is rapidly approaching, and i can count on one hand the number of friends i have. i haven't felt this lonely in years. ""just join more clubs!"" is the usual refrain, but let me tell you: **clubs are not a silver bullet.** i'm in some clubs, and they're nice, but they only go so far. 

perhaps one upside to these massive changes in my social life is that they've forced me to become further self-reliant and have prompted a renewed sense of self and individuality. i'm just worried that my current situation will remain the status quo for the foreseeable future. i've heard older people say that college was the greatest years of their life, but lately it's felt like anything but.",1713308266.0,

Well, your brain will still hate you sometimes. And that’s okay. It gets a lot better, a lot quieter— you find some meds that work okay. It takes a while. But the crying becomes less frequent, less devastating. You still laugh until you cry. Less poetry, but it doesn’t seem as necessary, now. 

You have a boyfriend. An infinitely kind and patient man. He loves you. You can tell by the way he touches you, so gentle, the way he never makes you feel bad for being who you are. There are hard days, but he always loves you, always reassures you. He’s so handsome and so kind. He feels like the other half of you you wanted with [redacted]. And he loves spending time with you. 

You have a job you like. There are bad parts like with everything, but it’s okay for now. Pays the bills, you get to sit down when you need to, and it’s semi relevant to that degree you feel so resentful of right now. Heck, you even work with your boyfriend. You never knew you could want to spend that much time with someone, but you do. 

You have cats. Two of them. A brother and sister. And they’re awful, awful, and the cutest things you’ve ever seen. They have a hundred names each and yell all the time and the sound makes you so happy, doesn’t bother you at all. 

You’re in a different city. Far, not too far, and somewhere you wouldn’t expect. It’s beautiful, trust me. You’re happy there. Your new favorite baseball team sucks, but somehow that makes it even more fun. 

You’re in grad school. Just the first class, right now. It’ll get harder. But you’ll get better. And you’re proud, and your dad is proud of you. 

Yeah your brain’s a little “wonky”. I think… you’ll always feel a lot. But that’s better than not enough. You’re safe. Read it again if you need to. You’re safe. A lot has happened, some good, some bad. But the folks you love make it through Covid (you’ll know when it happens) and you find a man who thinks you’re wonderful. I’m sure there’s a lot more good and bad to come, and you’ll handle it no matter what, so hang in there. 

I’m proud of you. I know he hurt you, a lot. But you did what was right when you left him and it gets so much better. I love you. And I’m here in the future, cheering for you.

Suddenly this past month, it's like they decided how I feel no longer matters. They cancel plans constantly, and today they decided to just outright not tell me they were cancelling plans and didn't let me know till I asked last second. I already went to visit while I was sick and exhausted because their mental health was crap, and this is the thanks I get? lol thanks.   

At least they'll make up for it by trying to re-plan, but since it's long distance, it's really annoying to go from 'they're coming over' to 'I'm coming over'. The thing is, I don't mind them staying at my place, which makes it easy for them to come over and go home at a reasonable time. They mind that I stay over, so I have to go home at night and I return home at 1 A.M to get up for work at 8:30 A.M the next day lol. Which frankly since I have stuff to take care of in reality I get like 6 hours of sleep when that happens. It's brutal. I wouldn't even mind if they asked me a day in advance so maybe I can try to sleep a little more or something. But no, every time it's day of which means my reaction to it is, ""Oh finally I'm done with work time to go home, can't wait... What do you mean, I'm not going home tonight, for another 5-6 hours?""

Tbh, I'm just gonna stop trying that hard with the relationship, it was one sided to begin with but at least this one recognized how much effort I put into the relationship and let me know they appreciated it. Which was FAARR more than others have. Tbh three weeks ago they cancelled on me without letting me know.

Am i the only one who think that they are the one with the problem? 

Do you need to wipe your hands on people s clothing in order to feel good about yourself?

Is it about domination like dogs do?

Sure dog is happy to dominate by putting his paw on something but aint we humans? 

I do know people from both sides , and the one constantly touching others for no reasons have all sort of problems . 

Either need to boost their confidence , have a large ego or want to be sure others give them there all listenning to them . 

I do feel better not been touched by some pigs freesh out of coughing in his hand... sying ""pardon me"" while wiping germs on my shoulder. 

I would say touchy peoples are closer to animals then they are to humans from my perspective. 

Sure dog is happy, but dog is the dog. act like a human and keep your own space. learn basic manners and interact with vocabulary.

Federal_Ant_394,I want to give up.,1,1c5st78,0,"I (17M) had 2 breakups in 2023, one in January and one in December. My first relationship was abusive and long distance which ended with her cheating on me and me going no contact on her for the last 4 months of our relationship, it left me with immense trauma that I started getting anxiety attacks and started overthinking a lot.

My second relationship with my ex was genuinely the most happiest I've ever been, I loved her and I felt loved too. Well on our second date we kissed and it was the first kiss of my life and I was glad we shared it but after our first kiss she avoided going out with me for a month, I ignored it considering her parents were strict but it was not the case when later on she admitted that indeed she avoided me. She always said ""let's take it slow"" and I agreed but later I realised it was a reason just to avoid going out with me when I confronted her about it she said that she was scared of intimacy and I assured her since we are underage and I am not ready for anything sexual( I had a trauma where I was bad touched by my neighbour when I was 14). We only used to kiss (which she had no problem with) and it was all consensual between us. I cared deeply for her, I always ensured she was comfortable around me, she started ignoring me again after couple of dates and this time when I confronted she said that we have not built an emotional connection and let's start talking to each other more in person which was not possible as her parents were strict and she only had 1 hour of time for us to meet irl but we used to text and call each other a lot so I figured that since we are 4 months into dating we already have a good emotional connection but she always disagreed. One day when we were out with a group of friends and I slowly tried to hold her hands she threw my hand away which actually hurted me a lot. 

She proposed a plan that from now on our dates we will only talk(which meant no hugs,kiss,hand holding etc) I agreed to it and instead of going out with me just once in a month she started going out with me quite regularly I was happy but not being able to hold her hands, hug her or even kiss her was eating me inside. One day she said ""look I know you are compromising and I don't like it"" I explained that I was not compromising and even if I was am compromising for the right person after pressuring me for a while I just said that I felt a little sad that I can't hug her, hold her hands and kiss her. 

After this conversation she said that our next date we'll do that and I was happy but one day before our date we were just talking and I reminded her of our date and she said yeah she almost forgot but she mentioned the no hugs and stuff, I told her that she didn't say that the last time and she denied even saying it and got defensive and we had an argument.

On the day of our 6th month anniversary she messaged me and told me that she wanted to talk to me about it for once and for all I agreed and the next day she dumped me which shocked me so much I became numb, she said while crying ""you never understood me"",she was angry too and I was scared because I realised I have lost her, I tried to comfort her and gave her water from my bottle, when I tried comforting her she said ""don't touch me, stay away from me!"" After saying all this she left and I stood there staring into nothingness. 

My self esteem was destroyed all my anxiety and overthinking went off the roof, I failed to cope with the ongoing stress as my finals were in the next 2 months. We had some casual friends and I lost half of my friend group. I deleted every photo of her and she did too and even removed our photos together from her Instagram which I could not because I just can't make myself to do it. She texted me one day telling me to delete it from my insta and I was so busy with my final practicals that I didn't check my messages and when I checked it she was threatening me to delete it or she'll take a big step against me and she blocked me and the next day after my class she comes to me and started checking my phone to see if I have any pictures of her even though I told her I deleted all of it after giving my phone back she started saying how I ignored her message intentionally and that's why she blocked me from Instagram, I realised that I don't have to defend myself here so I just apologised and wished her best of luck for everything in life and she left.

It's been 4 months since our breakup and I can't get over it. I don't smoke or drink so I don't have anything that can help me cope with all this. I keep blaming myself for all of this, my friend who I considered my best friend hangs out more often with her instead of me, ignores my text. I just can't do it anymore.

Academic-Education42,I (24NB) think I'm going to break up with the best partner (22NB) I've had (so far). Looking for support.,2,1c5n5n9,1,"Looking for support because I feel like a fucking dumbass right now.

My partner (22NB) and I (24NB) have been together for the past eight months.  They have done nothing wrong, they have raised no red flags, in fact, they've done the opposite.  They're the first person who really acknowledges all the different sides of my gender (I'm genderfluid), and I cannot describe how liberating it is to feel like I don't have to act a certain gender around someone.  They're a kind, caring, strong individual.

But when I hear that we've been dating for eight months, it's kind of baffling to me.  It feels like all we've done is some minor local events (weekend karaoke, go out to dinner, a bar crawl), go back to my apartment, and fuck.  For eight months.  And all of it has been amazing, don't get me wrong, they're the first 'first' I had that was a pleasurable experience, and when I'm with them, everything feels amazing, but it's like, fuck, is that it?

I want a partner who pushes me to grow, to try new things, to be someone I wasn't a year ago.  They don't do that.  I'm realizing that I want a partner who plans for the future - and I'm going to ask them tonight or this weekend - but I don't think they're doing that.  I don't think they have a plan to get their license, I don't think they have a plan to save money.  Maybe they can't, I don't know their financial situation in full - I know they make about half of what I do - and I don't like the way that 'I'm breaking up with you because I can, and am, saving for my financial future, but you can't' feels in my mouth.  I feel petty.

I feel like, if I love them, then that should trump those needs.  But it doesn't.  And I have to hope that there's more than one person out there who will treat me like they have these past eight months, because goddamnit it's been amazing.  And who knows, maybe they are planning on getting their license, or saving some money, I just don't think they have given everything I've seen thus far.

So yeah, if anyone could #validate my emotions right now, that'd be fantastic.  I feel like I'm throwing away the best, and the most stable, relationship I've had in a minute.  And yeah, I don't want to hurt them.

I spent 3 days in the hospital but no surgery was needed thankfully I was just really banged up. Some fractures to my pelvis, chunk out of my arm, and a head lac since it was the first and last time riding without a helmet. No internal bleeding or severe trauma which honestly I should have had seeing as I went through the windshield. 

Fast forward to today, I got news that my partners friend was in a very serious car accident where she was airlifted from scene. She has broken legs and an arm and went for surgery this afternoon. This girl is such a kind person and hard working and was the last person to deserve something as awful as this happening. It's going to take her months if not years to recover fully. 

I hate that she was so badly injured it seems unfair, she's a student commuting to school and trying to help her family. I can't even imagine how much this is going to set them back and god forbid there's any lasting effects from this for her lifetime. Then meanwhile there's me who's going to make a full recovery, I'm back walking around just scarred up but nothing too bad in the grand scheme. 

I can't wrap my head around why I would be spared from an accident and for someone else it's possibly life changing.

I’ve been trying to work on that but it’s hard and I know it’s going to take some time. But in the meantime…I just don’t know how to cope.  
  
I’ve been with my boyfriend since December, but “official” since March (I’m 34, he is 32—I was married for 2 years to someone I was together with for 8 years and got divorced in Feb 2022; he was in a LTR for 7 years until Jan 2023—we both are the ones who called off our respective relationships).  
  
Context aside, I’m struggling with the feeling of ALWAYS wanting to be with him. I have been doing a decent job of holding back the clingy though. He is just a breath of fresh air, I’m so in love with him, he makes me very happy, etc etc. The surface level stuff I like about him is just a bonus.  
  
He has a busy life (his full-time job, his side gig as musician, and other side gig as a streamer). I, however, do not. I work 9-5 M-F and while I have 2 side gigs as well, they don’t really keep my brain occupied and feel fulfilling.

I started volunteering at a local animal shelter and am fostering a senior cat, and while I love both things (huge animal lover here), I’m still just like, “I miss \[bf name\].

So I just feel like a loser all the friggin time. I thought the volunteering would help but it doesn’t as much as I’d hoped.

Yousirnaimme,Sometimes I wish I'd Die or Been Born a Cat or Summin,1,1c5s894,0,"Uni has been so shit for me. I have bad social anxiety and really struggle to put myself out there to meet new people and stuff, especially at uni. I have no friends and I feel pathetic and insecure, I mostly stay in my room which is both my safe haven and a prison. This is by far the most isolated I've ever felt and I can start to feel it eat at me. I dread when my old friends ask me how I'm finding Uni or how I've been, as I hate it and need to always lie through my teeth and say its fine. Recently I couldn't even bring myself to say that anymore and instead I just shrug and say its ""OK"" or ""meh"". All the while all my other friends are off having a great time getting to know people or growing into their true selves. I don't feel like I've changed or grown, I still feel like the same fucking 16 year old from 3 years ago. I still feel like an immature child who is too scared to come out of their shell. And it is through my anxiety that I pass up so many opportunities to grow from, like partying or going to pres, hanging out with a group of friends, whatever freshers do. On top of that, I hate my subject (Automotive Engineering) which is just the icing on the cake. I thought to myself, ""Hmm, I like cars and I like physics so putting that together must mean I should be an automotive engineer!"". No.

I am no natural-born engineer, I cannot think practically and I have no passion for engineering and am doubting more day by day that I'd want a career in it. This means I have little motivation to really try (and the sheer amount of content is fucking immense) which means with my already shit work ethic (I get distracted constantly, am a serial procrastinator and probably addicted to YouTube) I am just skating by on grades. I have summer exams coming up soon and I am so fucked for them since, of course, I did jackshit to catch up with lectures/practice questions and most of all there's this darn group project coming up that I have been dreading. Its a really big and difficult one, and I can't tell WHY I can't even bring myself to doing any of it until the literal last minute. I tell myself every single fucking time and I still can't just do it promptly, KNOWING I'd get a panic attack just before my work is due. I genuinely don't want to cause my whole group to fail but I am too scared of getting on with it for fear of realising how fucked I am. Its a viscious cycle.

I am stumped as to what to do. I have no marketable skills to fall back on, no backup plan, no friends, no idea what else I'd want to do, no way of knowing how I'd even immediately pay my 10k+ student loan back if I drop out and no hope.

Think about it; no work, no Uni, no struggles, just eat, sleep and be cute - that's it. I envy the simplicity and ease of a cat's life.

Dizzy-Palpitation-74,I hate myself.,2,1c5j8t5,1,"Early 30s, gay, relatively good looking but too shy to flirt, grew up poor but got a job that pays well with great benefits, and HIV+

I've had many exes in my life and in every ex I always ""adjusted"" my personality to fit them, in turn I lost myself.

My last ex gave me HIV, he cheated and we broke up already before I found out. Too late for me to get mad at him.

My current boyfriend is the first boyfriend who I told I'm HIV+ we were ok, only problem was he doesn't have money. But love conquers all I guess?

We've been together for a couple of years but just found out a few weeks ago he has a secret 50 thousand dollar gambling debt and now he has 0 money and 0 savings with that debt still to pay. He knows me and my family has some money. Somehow I'm about to be stuck trying to get him out of bankruptcy by paying for his debt and in turn he will pay my family?

I can't leave him because he knows my status and I can't bring myself to date anyone anymore.

Who would want to date a HIV+ gay guy in his 30s?

Everytime I date someone I'd be forced to reveal my status otherwise they'd sue me. Then soon after the world will know my status. Might as well advertise it.

People say being HIV+ is fine and all as long as you take your meds and is undetectable, but it doesn't change the fact that HIV is the number one most feared disease, especially here on Reddit.

I hate myself for giving so much of myself to other guys to the point where I've literally ruined myself getting HIV and now I'd have to come up with a payment plan to get my boyfriend out of debt.

Who would want me? I can't even bring myself to workout again because of so much stress from work, family, and now the only thing that made me happy is ruined. My boyfriend ruined us.

I hate myself for giving so much of me away.

Now I can't get back my youth. I can't get back my time. And I can't remove this damned virus from my body.

I wanted medical advice too incase it was something serious as I felt like that the whole day.

One of the guys was really hostile towards me and seemed really upset, which is understandable but I genuinely felt like my life was over because I couldn’t breathe at all and I called in the moment. I don’t know why I do this to myself.

ThrowRABieky,I feel spoiled because I’m in a good position in my life yet I can’t find satisfaction or happiness ,1,1c5rniu,2,"Hello guys, this is my first time posting on this sub or even reading some posts. 

I really need to get this off my chest. Will it get no likes and comments, all support or only negativity, it just feels good to write this down knowing there is a possibility I’m sharing it with a stranger.

I have had an OK upbringing. I’ve grown up in a lower middle class family. We’ve had a very big family with 5 kids and even 2 foster kids. I wasn’t really that spoiled as a kid since we had not a lot of access to money (no vacations, no trendy Nikes or Vans when I was a teen, no Playstation 3/4 when my friends had those or a smartphone until 2013) but nonetheless there weren’t any shortcomings either. I’ve had access to internet, nutritious food everyday and, though not always a fun home situation, a loving set of parents.

I don’t want to get too in depth about my youth but let’s say, even though it wasn’t the worst… it wasn’t the best either. I got SA’d by my foster brothers as a boy. My parents and family picked it up very well. They were kicked out and even with the low financials they mustered up every cent to send me to a therapist. I am very thankful for their effort.
My dad and my brother (we two are both adopted) fought a lot. Sometimes it would get physical. My brother can be very egocentric and my father amazingly stubborn. Besides that my brothers and sisters came in and out of the house due to failed relationships.

I never really felt a bond with my family. We don’t really… intellectually connect I feel. I do NOT look down upon them, I love them dearly and would never turn my back when in need. But I can tell I’m avoiding them. I feel like a POS because they want to involve me but my interests are somewhere else. They like the casual dilly dallying, drinking coffee or playing boardgames. I like to talk about politics, literature, arts and fashion. Our humour nor interests align. Whenever I talk about what I’m writing my thesis about or whatever brand I like I can feel them zoning out. Again, I’m not trying to say “my hobbies and interests are so profound” even though I really sound conspicuous like that. But their interests feel like the exact opposite.

Besides that I am almost done with my studies. It took me 8 years. 3 years of a wrong choice, 1 gap year and now a study I’m finaliseing just for the heck of it. I don’t wanna work in this section (event programming). Yet I know I should be more than thankful for me to even get this opportunity since it is a very western concept to even be able to complain about a future career path.

I am also a model. I’m not successful but I’ve did a fair share and have made a little money that could give me somewhat of a nice savings and buy me and my girlfriend some nice stuff.

My girlfriend is an angel. Though we differ in mentality (I’m very anxious and driven and she’s very laid-back and easy-going) we have truly found each other to be empowering.

I also have a TikTok account with 100k. Not that it really makes a difference but it’s still something a lot of people see as a milestone.

Now here’s my problem: on the outer shell I’m doing very good. I’m about to finish college, making money as a model whereas I travel the world, meet cool people, have a tiktok account that’s growing, a loving family and girlfriend.

In reality I feel left out. I don’t like the modelling industry. A lot of people feel superficial. To name an example: I’m pretty short to be a model (181cm). When I was at an event people just glazed over me. They would cut convos short. Not mean, just uninterested. The other models I was with got all the attention. Eventually word got out I was the most experienced of the bunch. I told them some brands I was with and suddenly the interest peaked and people talked to me. They were going for drinks after but I left.

I feel like I made the wrong career choice. Everyone wants to make cool parties, DJ events or festivals. To their right: it is fun and energetic. I’m just totally not that type. I chose this study to research more about leisure. How to get kids or elderly to move more, interact more. People think it’s boring or there is no money in there. I didn’t want to do this work for money, that’s what modelling is for. I wanted to make people happy. But everyone seems to be only interested in either: status, money or something that looks cool. 

I feel disconnected with my family. Like I said, I love them to bits. But I would never invite them for a cup of coffee. I’d let them sleep on my bed if their house burned down, but not for fun.

It feels like all I have is my girlfriend. I see all the people making it around me. Well made choices about money like becoming a banker. They took the risk to be a creative and now have found their passion. They’re taller and know how to play the modelling game so they make big bucks and see the biggest brands.

I just feel like an in-betweener. And most of all, like a privileged little fuck. Because, yes people are better off. But also; there’s kids being sold, people being covered in rubble from wars or workers being exploited.

I feel like my place here is undeserved. I’m ungrateful and I truly think I’ll never find satisfaction. I’d like to just vaporise and people forget I existed.

ComprehensiveRange9,Overhead person I used to have insane crush on having sex with flatmate 😐,1,1c5rncb,0,"Person I used to have crazy limerence for, I decided to cut contact for a few weeks, didn't really work cos tiny social group, got mega depressed as a result and was sorta stuck in a giant rut for a bit.

Then I found out she broke up with her BF, stupidly gave me some new false hope. Until I was talking to her old BF to make sure he was alright, and then a few weeks later, he spilled the beans that the reason they broke up was because she was having an emotional affair with my own fucking housemate. 😐

Plus I also referred this housemate to my company and he got an offer a few months ago, so I literally cannot fully escape this situation even if I wanted to unless I find a new job which seems very unlikely.

To be honest, weirdly this has cured my limerence, and I am like 90% over her since when I found out I was kinda furious and realised she is kinda bad person and someone I would never want to date, especially because supposedly this isn't even the first time she's cheated. Although there's still that small part of me which can't get over her.

And I heard them having sex earlier today, and it just made me a bit depressed again. Weirdly they deny that they are dating, maybe they're fwb but fwb's aren't meant to have proper feelings for each other lmao.

Life-Ad-7115,I desperately need help. I have a friend in trouble,2,1c5m030,0,"Hi reddit people.
I need advice, maybe it's too late, but I always want to hope.
I have a friend of mine who has been doing significantly badly in school in the last school year, in recent years she has always been average with decent grades, she has never been problematic. But now that we have to move on to the next class, the teachers have become more ""mean"" and her average grades have dropped and during the questions she acts silent and backs away. Every time there is a check to be done, she convinces herself that she knows nothing and does little or nothing. I've been trying to push her continuously lately, but in everything that requires her to make an effort or something that she doesn't like, she says that she doesn't know how to do it, she doesn't know how to do anything and she withdraws into herself. I gave her a lot of advice, I discussed it with her and she made some small attempts with the best teachers, but they are not enough, I wanted to try to help her but she keeps saying that she will never understand and when you say something positive she almost doesn't believes it. I also advised her that she could talk about it with a teacher or a psychologist but she continues to say that that won't change anything and she doesn't want to, and she withdraws into herself. I don't know if she studies every day, but when there are tests she says she hasn't done it. 

It's frustrating for me because I want to help her and see her happy even outside of the times when we joke around and talk about our favorite things. Really. It makes me want to stop helping her, throw in the towel and let her solve her problems on her own, let the world make her see the consequences of her choices because she doesn't want to get help, but I would feel extremely guilty if she didn't pass the year, if she became depressed, if her parents put all the blame on her instead of helping her. 

I think her parents are the problem too..
I love her and care about her, and nd I would like her to solve this problem so she can pass the year with me or at least believe in herself more. What do I do?

Efficient_Detail3734,I came to a realization that my ex only used me for sex,1,1c5r758,0,"I (27M) came to a realization that my ex (27M) only used me for sex during the relationship. He’d always turn down my advances or very rarely, he’d agree but he’d be hella irritated by me. But whenever he initiated I was supposed to jump up and get excited he was in the mood. It was as if I was being rewarded or something, which is very weird. From the things he would say/do that made me question if he even wanted to be with me ie: he’d say things like “when are we going to add a 3rd or 4th?” & “I told you fooling around with other people was something I wanted to do so be open to it!” even as far as telling me “Yeah I don’t like white boys”. During the relationship, he’d bring up my race a lot and he’d tell his friends that he’s dating a white guy. Right before breaking up, his extended fam was visiting from Mexico and he immediately called me and told me he was trying to avoid them cause he doesn’t like chit chat and doesn’t know them like that, so we talked on the phone for a few days then one day I didn’t hear from him. No texts, no calls. Then he texts saying he’s “talking with his family” and “spending time with his visiting fam”. Ok that’s not a problem. I gave him space and let him be. Given his behavioral pattern, I let it go then we continued on together but now (like many times before) there was this cold distance I was getting from him. Which wasn’t the first time. Not sure what him and his family talked about, I have my theories of course. During the break up he said something along the lines of “we’re nothing alike”, which is crazy cause we were A LOT alike, except for our race. It was crazy how similar him and I were. There’s other instances that’s happened, conversations were held, things were said etc but these are just things I’m writing to give context… My thing is if you don’t like white boys then why were we in a relationship? Unless your only motive was to just fuck? - Over the last several months I’ve been moving on as well as realizing what and who I was dealing with. I came to a few realizations after some time and as of recently, I came to a realization that he only used me for sex… - I’m not writing this to create a narrative of him or myself.

Clear-Willingness321,My partner is 37 years older than me - and I hate his wife.,0,1c5we42,1,"I (f20) have been happily dating my partner (m57, who we'll call D) for about a year and a half now. Before you flame me or freak out about how 'toxic' it is, he and his wife (f, in her 40s, who I'll refer to as R) are in an open relationship and have been polyamorous for a few years. They've been married for about a decade. They each have a couple kids from previous marriages, the youngest of which being a couple years younger than me.  

At the beginning of our relationship, it was more of a sugar daddy/fwb situation, not many feelings involved. However, it quickly evolved into an emotional attachment due to just how good we are for each other. I know how lame it sounds, but we really are. We compliment each other well, and urge the other to grow and thrive. We click better than I can put into words. D tried to keep me out of any drama with his other relationship for a long time, not wanting me to have any negative feelings towards R. At the beginning, R was fine with our relationship and I even met her a couple times, we weren't friends or anything but it wasn't as if I was some mistress he secretly had. After a while, R started to get more and more agitated with D. According to D, their relationship has been strained for the last few years, but only this past year has it gotten truly bad. D assures me that it's not my fault (which I know is at least a partial lie) and insists that she's only gotten worse because he's no longer stuck being miserable with her. Now that she sees him being happy with me (and in turn unhappy with her) she gets super jealous and, imo, toxic to him.

Well, it all took a turn for the worse when R got laid off from her job last year. Before this, D and R made quite a bit of money, easily paying for 4 kids' tuitions and two residences, and still having enough funds to regularly travel and stay in nice hotels. However, once R lost her job, it quickly went downhill. D still makes a decent amount of money, but started getting stressed about bills and things, highlighting the importance of her finding a new job. In this time, our relationship was only getting stronger. I wanted to be his safe haven, someone he could rely on even when things got tough. We started being together a lot more, and I stayed with him in his apartment pretty often (they have the shared house and he has a small apartment in another state where he works during the week). This meant that R felt left out and unsupported - which I completely understand, and feel for! However, instead of expressing her needs or communicating to D, she started drinking. *Heavily.* D was uncomfortable with this and tried to talk about it, which resulted in her being just straight up mean to him. She would scream at him and nitpick everything he did, even when he wasn't doing anything. Whenever he was with me (times when we had negotiated to be with one another, and she was fully aware of) she would spam his phone, accusing him of abandoning her and being a terrible partner, that he never supported her and that all she wanted was for him to love her. Then, when he would go back to her, she would push him away, tell him that he was too clingy, and that she hated being around him. 

Now, it's been almost a year since she lost her job. Don't get me wrong, I know how hard it is to pick up your life when things go to shit, and how awful finding a job is. But the cycle has just continued to spiral, and R almost seems to be *avoiding* getting a job. She's brought up selling the house and getting a divorce, which D has admitted sounds really good, but is scared he'll lose his family and friends. I hate seeing him hurt like this. He tries so hard not to unload on me, or to use me as his escape, but I can see how much it weighs on him. It's to the point where, when his phone buzzes with her name, his whole body tenses up. I don't know why he's still with her, but I also know it's not really my place to get in between their relationship. I try not to tell him about how much it affects me out of fear that he'll stop telling me things and just bottle it up. I want him to feel comfortable sharing his burdens with me, but every time I hear about how cruel she is I just get so angry. He's states repeatedly that he doesn't want there to be any hard feelings between R and I, since the conflict isn't between us. But more and more, I find myself resenting this woman. She knowingly hurts the man I love, just so she can watch him suffer the way she's suffering. I understand how difficult her life is right now, but I can't excuse hurting a loved one because they're happier than you.

aramatheis,"We won't be having kids, and it hurts",269,1c4ng80,53,"My wife and I have recently decided that we will not be having kids.

We are both early 30's and still have a few more years before it will be ""too late"". We own a small condo, and live modestly. My wife is in school and I work full time, so we don't really save much money. We don't live near any family.

We've been thinking a lot recently about having children, and I have always assumed I would be a father. I grew up religious and it was definitely implanted that procreation is the end goal of life. My wife has no strong feelings either way. If we had a child, I would prefer a daughter. But we have decided it is best not to have children.

We have very little savings, no (close) family support, and very little living space in our current home (which is all we could afford).We both want to have a comfortable life, and especially for me I want to provide for my wife, as she had a very difficult childhood and grew up in poverty.

Children are looking more and more like an impossibility, unless we happen to win the lottery or I get a giant pay increase. It also feels unfair to us to bring a child into this world of rising costs, climate crisis, wars, etc... in addition, my wife has childhood-related trauma, I have had mental health issues, and I also have a genetic illness that could potentially pass on.

Bundled with a few other, smaller reasons, we came to our conclusion.

I don't know if it is my religious upbringing, my own ego, or the fact that I don't want to disappoint my parents (who would love to have grandchildren), but this decision hurts my heart. Even if it makes logical sense. I always assumed I would be a dad.

But after he kept touching me during the classes. I got really triggered. And decided to end this. I told Mr K about all after classes. He got really worried for me and left his work early to take me to the hospital. Im really thankful of that.

Throughout this relationship, I feel I’ve been treated unfairly For example, if he hung out with his friend, I would ask him politely just to keep me updated as I have anxiety and overthink. He then would lie about where he’s going I would later find out from his little brother. Another example without informing me he packed up and spent the night with friend who in the day admitted to having drugs him driving around all evening with him in fear, I asked him not to get himself associated with that he got angry, and said I was controlling. Finally, he asked to hang out with his one friend and friends girlfriend, mind you he has ignored this friend for months and refused to talk to him at all cost. He then proceeded to hang out with him and talk about me badly for seemingly no reason than saying I don’t want you over there if they are arguing, it’s not gonna be good for you. After noting the behavior of not wanting to be around the friend, but only when the girlfriend is there, I asked him politely to cut contact with the girlfriend he has yet to talk to the friend again, although the friend has made many attempts.

Tough_Decision_998,Struggling to stay hopeful about my marriage,3,1c5h8nz,1,"Dear Reddit,

  
I (35M) am struggling with a growing sense of hopelessness about my marriage. My wife (Olivia) and I got married last year, had the wedding of our dreams, and have shared many amazing times, but it seems like things just get harder and harder. We're in couples therapy with someone good, but it is  difficult to maintain regular sessions because of our workload and our struggles with time management.

This is a long one, and I don't expect every single person on Reddit to take the time to read it and then carefully outline their thoughts, but I am just eager to get this off my chest and just fucking say this, because it is scary to admit. If you have any reactions, thoughts, insights or advice, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Here goes.

Olivia has been an amazing partner to me in so many ways. She was there through the death of my father. She has a good moral compass and is selfless almost to a fault. She stepped up to the plate in an incredibly self-sacrificing way to help keep my family's assets from collapsing into chaos in the wake of my dad’s passing. I have also done a lot of heavy lifting in this aspect, but my own grief and career commitments have prevented me from doing as much as she has. She has been a driver of immense growth on my part, helping me to be less selfish (only-child here) and more of an empathetic team player. I have always struggled with empathy, and she has helped with that. She comes from a great family, who I love, and they love me too.

I feel tremendously indebted to her for the ways she’s rolled up her sleeves and helped my mom and I through a really tough few years. But my feelings of indebtedness towards her often manifest as guilt, since she has made it clear on many occasions that the weight of managing these projects is hard for her, and that she struggles to avoid feeling resentful.

We also suffered some hard hits early on in our relationship. Within the first two years, she had a serious falling out with a business partner/friend/roommate, and had to find a new place to stay within days. Without thinking, I suggested that she move in with me, failing to consider that I had never lived with a partner before. It was hard on the relationship to make these adjustments in real time. In hindsight, it felt somewhat red-flaggy that she had exposed herself to a situation that could go sideways so fast, and leave herself so little runway to figure it out, without my being there to 'catch' her, logistically and financially speaking.

Also around this same time, she revealed to me that her business (freelance creative) was a lot less stable than I had thought it been. She revealed to me that she was roughly 30k in debt between her business and personal accounts - which was a big surprise to me. I reacted in a way that really hurt her. Looking back, I should have been way more empathetic and understanding, but at the time I really felt surprised and frankly a bit catfished. She shared at the time that this was a really deep wound for her, and something that she felt great shame for - and that my reaction was a worst case scenario for her. Her darkest moments are the ones where she feels she is being judged.

In fairness, her business is in a much better place today. Her personal and professional debt have been paid off almost entirely. She is still working to scale her business, but there are still challenges.

Around the same time, we struggled with an absolute nightmare abortion saga, which wreaked havoc on her physical and mental health. She opted for an at-home procedure that did not work, and lead to nearly three weeks of intense pain and hormonal issues. When I finally convinced her to seek medical attention again, after much arguing, she was able to go in and have a more comprehensive procedure that allowed her to begin to heal. Brutal on all counts.

This event forced us to have a very rushed conversation about kids, marriage, and partnership that I believe should have been left to unfold naturally as we got to know each other better.  
We also both agree that this was a cataclysmic event for our previously wonderful intimate connection as we knew it. This process had very adverse effects on her hormones, her libido, her ability to enjoy intimate touch and pleasure, and her ability to shed weight.

In the wake of this, my desire to regain our intimacy became a big issue, and lead to a lot of conflict. I tried so hard to give her as many months as she needed to heal and become excited about reconnecting physically again, but every time I would even ask about it, it would lead to a tearful fight and reset the clock. This period highlighted a pattern of her withholding intimacy from me, which I believe was always the case, but not quite as obvious to me leading up to that. To this day, there are always myriad reasons for us to not have sex. I really hate this aspect of our relationship and she has admitted that this is not ideal, and has expressed wanting to fix it several times. But I feel angry and hopeless regardless.

In the intervening time, we have somewhat repaired this, but our intimacy is not nearly at the level or frequency that I need. I have a pretty high sex drive, I'm very kink-affirmed, and value sex and intimacy very much in a relationship. I feel very unmatched and alone in this. There were some really promising moments in the early days, where it seemed like some of my deepest desires were things that she was into exploring with me, but it's become apparent that these were one-off fluke events that she is not currently excited about revisiting. She says that maybe in the future we can talk about it, but right now I am saddened and deeply disappointed by this, as this was something that really helped convince me she could be the one. I long for partnerships from the past, where in spite of the other issues, mutual attraction was always there, and great sex was almost always attainable.

I also found out roughly two years into our relationship that she had given me herpes. To be clear, I fucked around a ton and had lots of fun in college and afterwards, and frankly I’m surprised I wasn’t the one giving it to her. But the way I found out was by eavesdropping on a conversation between her and her brother (great dude) about life, sexuality, shame, etc. They were in a different area of the house that I rarely go to and I admit that I went to go eavesdrop because we were having a major fight at the time.

I confronted her about it, but because she is a person who is highly sensitive and really struggles with shame, it hasn’t really been “okay” for me to take her to task on this and be mad at her about it. I guess if we’re in a committee marriage, what’s the difference? But still. What the fuck.

In spite of all this, there were also great moments. There were amazing adventures, we made a home together (Olivia is a great designer), we had moments of great intimacy once again, shared lots of joy and happiness together, and pushed each other to grow in positive ways. In spite of our fights and differences, I did find myself coming back to the belief that this is a person who I could be with person forever.

And then my dad died. He was an amazing father and man. Our best years were our last ones together, and I couldn’t have asked for a better dad. That being said, he left us some real estate assets to deal with that were fucked up enough that were more liabilities than assets, and required ultra immediate attention to avoid major financial consequences for my family. In the depths of our grief, Olivia and I had no choice but to become real estate people and start managing some of these assets full time. My mom is successful in her career, and still working, but totally lacked the skills to make a difference in this area. Olivia and I were not married yet, but we had become full-time business partners and asset managers in a way that felt terrifying, out of control, stressful, and filled me with anger that my dad had not been forthright about how screwed up some of these properties were.

It felt like the closer we became as business partners, the more our relationship suffered.

And then two months later her mom almost died of cardiovascular issues. I was so shell shocked at this point that although I tried, I wasn’t able to be there to the extent that she felt that she had been there for me. I really did try, and I feel we have different stories about how things went down during this time. She still feels that it wasn’t enough. Her mom pulled through thankfully.

And so did we. Somehow we got through it, and pushed through what was easily the worst year of our lives. We got married. It was stressful to plan, and cost us a lot of sleep, and my mom created lots of mayhem, but the wedding was a total fantasy of friends, epic adventure, great stories, and endless laughs in a place that is ultra special to us. On that night before we got married, I looked at her and totally knew in my heart that she was the one. Any doubt that was once there was totally gone in that moment.

We’re now less than a year into our marriage, and I’m finding myself increasingly alarmed by intrusive thoughts and the doubts that have returned with a vengeance. I think:

* Why am I not with someone who I’m more consistently attracted to, inside and out? Why has our sex life become such a shell of what I would have hoped for in a partner? Can't I do better than her?
* Why do we fight so much? For two freelance creatives with total autonomy over their time, it feels like all we do is work ourselves into the ground and can never agree on when to take a break, or when to push hard. Time management is our biggest enemy - birthdays go by uncelebrated, we see friends less and less, and the weight of managing my family’s assets is never ending for both of us. Our actual careers, which we both enjoy, suffer too.
* I cannot, CANNOT stop thinking about what it would be like to date once again. I see women sometimes and think, damn - now that’s a woman. I bet she would fulfill this need, or go on this trip, or whatever. I used to travel almost constantly for work, and I felt an insane sense of freedom and adventure being a confident, single, world-traveling man who could go anywhere I wanted, and meet anyone. I had great times meeting interesting women, both at home and abroad, and cannot accept that this part of me is dead, gone, forever over. I feel it dying to come out sometimes when I am alone, in a new place, and it makes me feel really alive. And when I feel like I’m not being taken care of intimately by Olivia, this is really fucking hard and shitty.
* I find myself thinking very critically of her: Why is she so shy and introverted? Why is she so sensitive and fragile? When did she suddenly just stop being attractive to me, both mentally and physically? What did I ever see in her?
* We used to fight and mediate conflict in a way that our friends really admired and respected. Now we are just two banshees trying to berate and shame one another into submission. I hate her debate style, and feel like she is such a poor storyteller that I can't sit still to hear her side of the story.
* I find myself running through scenarios where I try to calculate all of the collateral damage that would result from a separation. Despite the overwhelming amount of time that Olivia spends feeling unsupported/disappointed/angry with me, I know she would be physically, emotionally, and financially crushed by this, which I have no desire to do. To make matters more complex, when we got married, we never actually got legally married. We just did the party and the ceremony. Which means she would not benefit financially from a separation. She would likely have to leave the city we live in and move in with her folks, who live two hours away. The shame and the stress of having to capitulate and explain all of this to friends and family, and everyone who supported us along the way and came to our wedding, is daunting to say the least.
* Further to this point, I have wondered whether she is just sticking around in this partnership because of the security that it represents. Ostensibly, if we can just figure our shit out, repair the ship, and make peace, our shared financial futures are bright, largely because of the stuff we stand to inherit from my folks. It's nothing insane, but with clever management and a ton of work over the next twenty years, we would be set up for a comfortable and enjoyable life. All that being said, I also have to take responsibility for my own shit and my own failings as a partner:
* I learned a lot of really terrible habits from my mother, who is profoundly talented and charismatic, but also very selfish and unaware. We do the same thing professionally, and I have inherited many of her worst and best traits.
* One of Olivia's biggest complaints is that she feels like she is carrying the majority of the mental load when it comes to 'steering the ship' of our lives, and therefore cannot relax. As inane as it sounds, I cannot help but wonder why she has insisted on signing herself up for being in charge of so many things that bring her such immense stress, rather than just setting boundaries and making it clear that someone else is going to have to step up and handle it.
* I lash out and make Olivia feel unsafe, and when I have done wrong, my first instinct is to try to debate my way out of guilt.
* I am an adventurer at heart, and my solution for everything is to just go do something epic when things get hard. Olivia on the other hand is driven by fixing things - putting things in order where they have fallen into disrepair, and not taking a single second to yourself until things are back to be dialed in. Sometimes, this is a good balance, other times it's just mayhem.
* I struggle SO hard with empathy. On the one hand, I feel that Olivia is so sensitive and fragile that I can barely stand it, but on the other hand, I can understand where she is coming from when she says that she feels really unsupported, and a lack of care from me. I do my best to support her financially, to help her talk through her struggles, but it is not enough for her.

And that's the end.

Throwaway593792,I fell in love with a girl i met online ,1,1c5pzjy,0,"I met this girl through a groupchat we were in together on instagram. She was 15F and i was 17M. We used to chat occasionally but I always thought she looked gorgeous to me. I wont get too much into the details, but we slowly started talking more and more(or so I thought, since i was the one who always carried our conversations). The more i texted her, the more i grew obsessed with her. On her birthday (November), I wished her happy birthday, posted an instagram story and went to sleep. When I checked my phone later that day after waking up, I saw that she had texted me,”Would you like to date me?” I was obviously down to date her  but still was confused as to why she would ask me something like that. We still had kind of flirted a while back, but this coming from her was pretty weird to me. I joked around a bit about that message but did say yes, to which she just said, “nah, I’m not looking to date online.” I understand that people don’t wanna date online, but why would she ask me that if she never intended to say yes? I still agreed to be friends but I just couldn’t hold a normal conversation with her anymore. Eventually, I just unfollowed her. All of this happened around November 2023. Currently, it’s april 2024, and I still somehow can’t forget her. I go out everyday, have been asked out by another girl I know irl, but I just can’t focus on anyone except her. This is extremely weird and annoying and I just wish I could still have her. I don’t think I’ll ever truly move on from her. I might find someone again in my life, but I’ll never be able to forget her. I feel like an idiot 

P.S. Before someone says “you can’t fall in love with anyone you’ve never met,” it might not happen to you, but you can still catch feelings with people without having physical contact. ",1713298256.0,
Accomplished-Fox-822,i saw a hanging body,8,1c5bbgm,12,"so before school yesterday, i went on a run around the canal that’s near my house. i went the same way up and the same way back because it’s just a straight path. on the way back i saw two women crying next to this little wooden bridge, they were phoning someone, presumably the police, and were looking at this blonde girl who looked to me like she was just standing in the water- it’s a shallow canal. she was distinctly wearing a bright red sweatshirt and she looked about my age (15-16). 

at first i didn’t know she was dead, i kept running then i realised that she had a rope around her neck. i thought “you don’t see that everyday”, then “holy shit, that girl hanged herself”. i slowed down and called my mum, just warning her to not walk the dogs down the canal, but understandably i started having a huge breakdown because i’ve never seen a dead person before, especially not someone who committed suicide.

it’s the stuff you’re disturbed just hearing about on the news or seeing in a movie, i never thought i’d have to see that close up. 

luckily i heard loads of sirens when i was sprinting back home, and my mum was a great help and stayed off work for me. we watched bridesmaids to get our mind of things.

luckily my school got in touch and they said that they can provide support, and “emergency counselling”, but i’m not sure i need it. i’m completely traumatised, and i couldn’t sleep last night, but there’s honestly not much to talk about.

i wanted to ask anyone for help because no one in my family has had this kind of experience before. i just can’t stop thinking about it and i have never felt this shaken up before.

i have this weird headache where it feels like i have a bruise on my forehead, and i spent the majority of yesterday just feeling nauseous.

i hope the girl isn’t someone who i know because i couldn’t get a good look at her face, though i’m kind of glad about that.

the worst part is that if i had seen the girl at the start of my run it would have been me who’d discovered her. i ran past her at the beginning of my run which is still haunting me.",1713257503.0,
,I hurt my gf and it’s come back to haunt me,0,1c5vaq9,5,"(Trigger warnings for SA) I would like to start this off by saying that I acknowledge how this is all my fault and I’m a terrible person. I (M16) had been dating my girlfriend(F16) for a year. However today she broke up with me. When asking her why, she never gave me a full answer until I pushed too far. It was all because of an event from last summer.

We were teasing each other sexually but she fell asleep. I decided to sa her. It wasn’t until I was done that i realized my actions. She was crying, traumatized because of my actions. I realized that I hurt her and felt immense guilt. I cried to her that I was sorry and how I should have thought about she felt. She claimed that she forgiven me and I had learned my lesson. I understood that my actions were terrible and I had not forgiven myself. Anytime that day comes to my mind, I wish I could take it back

From there our relationship continued, seeming to get better. I had always respected her boundaries and would always ask her before doing anything. It wasn’t until this last week that everything fell apart.

It started after we got into an argument. Nothing big. I just felt that my opinion was being disrespected from time to time. This pushed her over the edge. 

She started crying and claiming that she was a terrible girlfriend and that I should find someone better. I knew this couldn’t be the case. Nobody gets into one argument and decides they’re not fit for each other. I kept pushing asking her why until she told me why.

She had never gotten over that day. She knew it was wrong and felt wrong for continuing to date me. She said she still liked me and wanted to be friends but couldn’t continue to date me. I understood that she was in pain and the guilt has really been hitting me in the past 24 hours. I hate that I did those things. 

Things have ended between us but I don’t know how to continue. I feel like an ass hole and I know I’m an ass hole. I know I have no right to play the victim but my mind is falling apart. I loved her so much and I hate myself for being the downfall of our relationship. I want to fix her pain but I don’t know if I could handle anything anymore. My mind is telling myself to end it all and kms. I hope that this post will help me calm down and get some advice to fix everything.

SecretlyADuckling,I think my friends were looking for reasons to kick me out,1,1c5ptqf,0,"Sorry for format I’m on mobile. Hey Reddit. Long time no post. About a year ago I (currently 18) posted about how my friend offered the table we were sitting at to take a photo with her, then physically pushed me out of a photo-by my face might I add- because the girl taking the photo (we’ll call J) didn’t want me in it. It really hurt me at the time but as time passed I forgot about it. Looking back that wasn’t the first thing that really should’ve set me off that they didn’t like me but it was the biggest. J physically putting her hands on me sucked, and thinking about it now it still does because it shows that we were never truly friends. Fast forward to now. J and I got in a fight and I’ll be the first to admit it was completely my fault. I took a joke too far and I didn’t realize J was uncomfortable. After J left they texted me about how it made them feel to which I immediately apologized and gave them space, which they asked for. Within the next week I opened an app that all my friends had a shared group chat with me in and I noticed another friend took me off the group chat, which totally crushed me as I thought I was at least closer with this friend. It was a group of 12 and they were pretty much my only friends at the time. I’m only in contact with 1 right now as they said they wanted to remain friends with me as I was closest with them. I totally get why J was mad and they had every right to be upset with me, but it just hurts that they all left and tbh I feel guilty for talking to the one friend as I don’t want to make them lose friends too if people find out we’re still in contact. I know that it was my own mistakes which brought this about but dealing with all of this on my own was really hard as I didn’t have other friends at the time. I just can’t help but feel like they were waiting for some reason to leave me. Sorry if this is all weird I thought I was in an okay place until I remembered about the photo incident and that just made everything worse again. ",1713297871.0,
kigmaster,I hate how people assume men don't take care of their children because they don't want to,3,1c5gz46,3,"I was talking to this girl, and we were discussing how most children are raised by mothers, and I told her that I was brought up the same way, then she started saying my dad was a masochist and started ranting about how dads don't help out in the family while I was over here like wtf are you saying. 

Maybe the reason he couldn't help out was because he was working his ass off in a 9-5 job so he there would be food on the table? And I know my dad well enough to know that if given the choice between staying at home taking care of me and going to work, he would choose the former without a question. And I'm pretty sure 99% of dads would pick the same thing.

Mediocre-Mouse-8108,Should I and could I get over his “cheating”: Need Advice,1,1c5psc2,1,"Hey Reddit,

I find myself in a bit of a puzzling situation and could really use some guidance. Not really sure how to classify this situation but my feelings right now are definitely the feelings of a partner that has been cheated on and I don’t know if I am being unreasonable or not.

For context, I am particular about my SO’s interactions with females (eg: influencers) online and as such throughout 4 years, he has consistently showed that he doesn't find other girls attractive other than me. He reaffirms this by not engaging with opposite-gender content on his social media feeds, and hasn't watched porn since we've been together.

However, recently, I discovered that my partner has been engaging with sexual TikTok trends and clicking into the profiles of a few girls. This was the kind of behaviour he used to have when he was single (he’s always been interested in those sexually explicit Tiktok dances). Obviously, I confronted him about it. He immediately admitted that it was a spur-of-the-moment curiosity as the girls pop-ed up on his FYP and he thought them to be attractive. 

To me, finding a girl attractive is one thing but actively finding more information on them by viewing their profile, etc? I wish he could have been open about finding them hot instead of me having to find out and then realising my boyfriend is not the person he alleges and has been acting like.

Nevertheless, he’s been incredibly remorseful, expressing deep sorrow and confusion over his actions ever since the confrontation. He's been visibly upset, crying, and apologizing profusely, as he cannot understand why he engaged in such behavior since he gains nothing from it and his libido is generally low. He is extremely sorry for putting me through this hurt and is genuinely committed to making things right.

This situation has left me feeling conflicted and unsure about how to proceed. While I appreciate his honesty and remorse, I have been trying for days but I still can't shake off the feeling of betrayal and the uncertainty about what this means for our relationship moving forward. I don’t know how to explain it but, can I even get past this? It just feels like I can’t trust him anymore and I literally think that I am the problem that he chose to engage such behaviour out of nowhere when typically I am someone with extremely high self confidence. 

This situation has really rendered me into a different person. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you handle it, and what advice do you have for someone in my position? 

Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help. ",1713297776.0,

I didn’t even want to come to work today, but I figured that I couldn’t let my students down. And I’m so happy I made this decision.. seeing their happy faces made me feel a lot better. They were drawing, painting, chatting .. I was so happy seeing them so eager to learn how to use watercolor or charcoal. I didn’t even notice their joy to create before, as I was more focused on keeping the room not so messy …. In the end I’m very thankful to have this job. ",1713283673.0,

PerplexedDot,I’m tired of parents neglecting me emotionally,4,1c5ekqt,0,"I’m a male (18) in high school who’s been pretty long into depression. Probably couple of personality disorders too associated to them. From my youth in an Asian household, I’ve felt constant neglect in emotional needs. In the times in the age of elementary school, I remember often times crying alone in my room scolded by my parents, instilling me the belief I’m isolated by everyone and nobody gives a damn about me. I’ve also seen my parents fight each other both verbally and physically, which led me to constant anxiety and expectation of worst in every scenario. Recently, I decided that I’ve had enough of this and unless I take antidepressants or whatever, I might end my life eventually. Starting to take antidepressants and therapy, I realized how mistreated I was from my parents and the love and care I was supposed to get. I was very surprised in the amount of friends and teachers who offered support in that I’m not alone, and my feelings in fact matter. Now, I regret emotionally investing in my parents who never took my complaints and cryouts seriously. I feel bitter towards my dad who always acts cold and distant to me meanwhile becoming the most friendliest person when he’s around someone other than my family. I feel bitter towards my mom who I tried for years explaining my mental state but never took my emotional needs seriously, pretends to care but thinks I’m just weak and need to grow the f*ck up, even calling me a psychopath or sociopath. I feel so hopeless that my only wish is to earn sufficient money and move out.",1713269605.0,

Distribution-Worldly,fucked up my entire life in three years.,1,1c5p6ly,0,"I started my bachelors degree in germany in 2020. Terrible idea. If nothing else, it's cheap, but i've failed or almost-failed every single course. I got a job in my second year, and it went well for three months, until I started taking anti-depressants and became so apathetic that i didn't go to work for two months. Fuck knows what was wrong with me. I felt too anxious to apply to another one right after, and now it's been years. I have nothing on my resume except my garbage grades and my still-incomplete bachelors degree. I probably won't get into any master's programs. 

Ever since then I've been on the verge of getting kicked out of university.  I haven't gotten any better at anything than i was when i started studying. Feel like i chose the wrong degree, because my classmates are lapping me--better grades, better jobs. Better lives. My closest friends are all coupled up and it hurts. It feels like I have no one who will put me first.

now I'm halfway through my fourth year, and I've let down absolutely everyone. My mom keeps telling me grades don't matter after your first job, but will anyone give me a first job? She's been supporting out family all by herself since my father died ten years ago. I hate myself for being a burden on her.

A friend of my parents is incredibly successful, and has been believing in me and my potential for years. He called me yesterday for the first time in a long time. I can't tell him how badly I've failed. How badly I'm going to keep failing. He kept telling me that I was an incredibly smart person, that he believed in my abilities. I'm so ashamed of myself. I wish i was a different person, a better person.

My girlfriend knows and is supportive and I love her for it. She does a really spot on impression so sometimes when I'm stressed I ask her to talk to me in his voice. I love them both equally. I want to marry them. 

Just to be clear I know he's not real. I know he won't ever meet me. My heart hurts when I think about that. But just the thought of him is enough, I'll be loyal to him forever and always.

Electronic-Weird-189,I can't take misandry/hatred towards men in social media,1,1c5oyll,3,"So there is a new controversial video going on TikTok that went viral when women are being asked in the street interview whenever they would rather meet a bear in the woods or a man in the woods. Some women were genuinely answering that they would rather to meet a bear, some argumenting that there could be certain procedures to defend against a bear, like if a bear rushed at them, they can rush back at the bear to scare them off, use the bear spray or punch the bear. Whereas man being unpredictable. In comments, I saw stuff like, ""when I die, leave me in the woods for the wolves will be gentler than any man"", that the bear wouldn't rape them, torture them etc.  
  
What I find problematic in this that those women will see a random man as a rapist, sadist that will catch them, drag somewhere and torture them for power drive etc. instead of seeing them just neutral person that will just walk past them and never think of them again which I believe would be the most common scenario.  
  
When I called it out as misandry I got flooded with comments that I am part of the problem, that hopefully I will never get a girlfriend, that I need to shut up because I am not a woman, that statistics say most SA/homicide crimes comes from men, that I am undermining their experiences with men and many more. I've tried to talk with some saying that just because some men have potential to hurt women, doesn't mean that they will do it. In response, I got that they won't risk it because one in a million men are good, or I should try swimming in a pool of crocodiles because that would make me relate to their problem. Honestly, I've just deleted it after a while because I couldn't take it anymore.  
  
This is not the only time I am experiencing like this. Later that day I saw a TikTok where a 60-year-old woman is calling police admitting to shooting dead their 65-year-old husband because he was watching pornography. Comments from women were saying that they ""kind of get it"".  
  
This type of content is basically cherry on top, other includes of how men only role is to provide for women, how they would laugh at them because they are emotional, how they are not allowed to say how they feel, how hatred towards men/misandry doesn't exist or they admit that it exists and they are practice it regulary and it is absolutely okay.  
  
I've talked about it with my therapist which in response I got that I shouldn't be engaging in this type of discussions if I belive it will hurt me even more, because It seems that I can't take it, by doing that I am basically stirring up the hornet nest. We also talked about that in a certain way I am allowing myself to be generalized thus hurt by this type of content, but then again it's hard for me to stay silent to this kind of treatment which seems to be getting worse and worse throughout the years.",1713295768.0,

&#x200B;

I'll be using fake names to describe this story. This might end up as a throw-away account. Who knows.

&#x200B;

I used to have a bandmate (let's call her Carrie) and she was one of our vocalists. Pre-pandemic, we got really close but nothing romantic happened. I found her attractive but I didn't think I was strongly attracted to her back then. I do admit I've always had a kind of a crush on her, but I never made a move on her because I thought she was straight. Emphasis on thought. (More on this later)

&#x200B;

We spent a lot of time together. We hung out in and out of band schedules. We chatted a lot thru Facebook Messenger when we were apart. She was also okay with sharing skinship (me putting my arm around her shoulder, resting my chin or head on her shoulders, linking arms, occassional hand-holding, and hugs). I'm the primary instigator since physical touch is my primary love language, but there were instances where she would initiate it. These were all done within friendly boundaries. We'd occassionaly exchange ""flirty"" banter, but they all rooted from my cheesy statements. For context, I have an English accent and am fond of petnames. I'd often use phrases like, ""Make sure to message me once you get home"", and ""You're lucky that I love you"". Then, I combine them with my favourite petnames like ""babe"", ""darling"", and ""love"". But again, it was clear to both of us that that was just me being me. And I never made a proper move on her. Our convos never really delved into romantic territory even when we talked about our past relationships. Neither of us were giving nor receiving mixed signals as far as I knew.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the pandemic times: like any and all forms of relationship during quarantine, my chats with Carrie dwindled in frequency. We both worked hard to keep in touch, but life just gets in the way. And as much as we wanted to meet up in person when things slowly returned to normal, we still couldn't because she was working for a shitty company (made her and her co-workers work overtime without pay among other stuff) and I jumped from different freelancing jobs. Our communication suffered more because she could only manage to reply once she gets off work. Which was late at night. And during that time, I was working the graveyard shift so I ended up replying in the morning or afternoon. And that cycle continued until 2021. We made sure to greet each other's birthdays, but we both knew things were just not the same anymore. It came to a point where we just completely stopped chatting.

&#x200B;

Another fast forward, this time to this year. Specifically last week.

&#x200B;

I was hanging out with a couple of our mutual friends (Carrie and I share a lot of our circles) when they blurted out in the middle of our conversation that Carrie was in a relationship with some lesbian none of us knew. My initial reaction was looking like the ""😳"" emoji. I couldn't bloody believe it because they said it was a lesbian. A LESBIAN! I immediately asked for clarification once I recovered my bearings.

&#x200B;

They showed me that she updated her relationship status in Facebook back in 2022. Then we stalked the person Carrie was in a relationship with. I argued that maybe she was just a feminine-looking guy. But the more we looked, the more my denial crumbled. The girlfriend—let's call her Sammy—was indeed a female.

&#x200B;

What irked me the most was how similar Sammy was to me. We both had boyish haircuts, wore androgynous clothes, and from her posts and Facebook My Days, I could easily say we give off the same ""vibes"". I was about to push those thoughts aside (won't be the first time I self-sabotaged through overthinking) when one of our friends pointed out the exact same things I was thinking. And to drive the point further, another female friend said this:

&#x200B;

""Didn't you two used to be a thing? Looks like her type never really changed. She replaced you with someone who's basically a clone of you if we're talking appearances and first impression alone. Love the consistency.""

&#x200B;

She said it in a teasing manner. They just wanted pull my leg to get a reaction and were all looking at me, waiting for a funny rebuttal because they all knew we never dated. But it was a running joke that we were our band's ""official couple"" since we were the closest. They even called us the parents of the band since we take care of everyone.

&#x200B;

But I was frozen. I just stared at my phone as I browsed through Carrie's timeline for the first time in 3 years. The most recent post was Sammy saying ""I love you"" in a different language. I opened the comments, and lo and behold, Carrie replied with ""I love you more"". And I felt my heart sank.

&#x200B;

Because that was our thing.

&#x200B;

If my primary love language is touch, Carrie's is words of affirmation. So she'd always say she loves me in our chats and in real life. At first, I didn't know how to react or reply to it because I suck with words. But I eventually began replying with ""I love you more"" to return the favour. Since she doesn't mind my love for skinship, I decided I wanted to respond with her primary love language as well. So whenever one of us needs to stop chatting (to go to sleep or go do something), an ""I love you"" will be sent. And the recipient would reply with ""I love you more"". I don't know how or when, but we also did it IRL whenever we parted ways.

&#x200B;

It became our thing because whenever Carrie would reply to our other friends' ""i love you"" with ""I love you too"". It was never ""more"". She only did that with me. Even our friends noticed and pointed it out. But Carrie and I would always brush it off by saying ""it's a bestfriends' thing"". And Carrie refused to use it with anyone else back then. But now, this Sammy person was now the recipient of that special set of words. At that time, I also suddenly realised that we stopped saying our ""i love yous"" to each other in our chats around 2021 to 2022.

&#x200B;

Now I know why.

&#x200B;

For the rest of the night, our friends stalked both Carrie and Sammy's accounts. They'd repeteadly ask me if I knew Carrie swung that way. To which I'd always answer with, ""No. I thought she was straight."" She never really said anything about her sexuality. And her 3 past relationships were all guys. So that might be why I assumed she was straight. I went home that night with these questions running through my mind:

&#x200B;

*Why did I never ask about her sexuality? If I did find out that she was into girls, would that change anything? So did I like her more than I thought I did? Am I jealous of this Sammy person she's currently dating? And since she's apparently gay, did she perhaps have had feelings for me back then?*

&#x200B;

*Did I miss my one in a million chance? Did I let my soulmate slip through my fingers?*

&#x200B;

This has been eating at me ever since. And today, Carrie posted yet another Facebook story abut how she misses Sammy. And I couldn't really pinpoint what exactly it is I am feeling. So I decided to post it here and ask a bunch of random strangers on the internet. But I'm not really seeking advice. I just wanted to let it all out. And I feel like I can't talk about this with our friends since I've been strongly denying that there was something going on between us ever since back then. I don't wanna open up to them because I, myself, am not quite sure what's going on with me.

&#x200B;

A part of me wants to reconnect with Carrie and maybe ask her if she has always liked girls. Or maybe she just recently came into terms with it. But ultimately, there's a muffled voice in the back of my head screaming that I just want to ask if she ever had feelings for me. But I won't do any of that.

&#x200B;

She looks happy with her current relationship. I don't aim to ruin it because of a ""what if"" scenario. If I really am/was in love with her, the last thing I want is shatter her source of happiness. And right now, that's Sammy. Not me.

Now, they aren't bad people by any means, they may have not insulted or threatened me but they have unintentionally made me feel like all I'm good for is being someone to console to. Now bc of them I don't feel comfortable talking about my feelings and have resorted to ignoring texts from them (or just saying I'm busy) just so they don't trauma dump on me again. 

Of course I can't just tell them this or they'll immediately jump to thinking that they're a burden to me, again they aren't bad people, I'm just sick and tired of being the one they always trauma dump.

The thing is most of the people don't even talk to me first, and I know that it's my own fault for being so closed off and having no social skills. And I feel so left out, I want to feel included but I don't know where to start. Like it makes me sad when I see the way people interact with me, as I can see their awkwardness, and I'm just a really boring person. But I guess I'm a little gratefull that atleast they don't forget I exist when they do the head count. Another thing I feel left out about is I guess my personality. Like all the girls in the group like to dress up pretty put make up on and take a lot of photos. And I wish I was comfortable doing all that. Like growing up my mom never made me comfortable in my own skin or dressing up and looked at wearing make up as a taboo. So I never did it and I didn't have the energy to argue with her. But now I feel so left out, that I can't relate to the girls. Like all the kids were together looking at the street markets and I felt so icky, and sorry for my self when all the girls were looking at jewellery/ make up while I didn't know about anything. And I could see the guys standing next to the stalls waiting while I just awkwardly waited next to the girls. I hate that I'm like this. Maybe if I was atleast confident in myself. And maybe I'm just depressed but I genuinely don't find the happiness everyone else is feeling. Another thing that I hate about myself is my face, so many time my parents, the aunties, the uncles, the people I don't even talk to or my friends in general always say I have a dead face. They always tell me to smile or just look happy even if I'm not, but I don't know how to do that. The other day my dad literally Said to practice smiling and laughing in front of the mirror, and I felt like crying right then and there, do I really have a problem? I'm so sad, is this all just because I lack social interaction/ intimacy? I don't know what went wrong for me to turn Out like this. Like my sister is the complete opposite of me and I'm jealous. I want to change, but it's difficult to when there's nothing motivating me. Nothing I keeping me going. I really thought I got better recently, but everything came back during this trip. And I don't want to be a burden  to anyone. ",1713292564.0,
AcademicFact1151,I’m about to get married and my dad is ruining our entire family ,2,1c5i07l,0,"My mom has a degenerative disease that has made her have to stop working and really doing much of anything. She can no longer drive and has a very hard time with walking and some speech difficulties, but thankfully she is mentally still the same old mom. 

My dad is an immature almost 60 year old who always has needed attention and when my mom first got sick in 2020, that was one of my concerns. Fast forward to 2021 and we had inklings my dad was cheating after finding texts messages but after calling him out his excuse seemed valid and that he wasn’t having an affair. Fast forward to 2023 and we (my siblings and aunts) found his fake profile and took screenshots for months while coming up with a plan to confront him. We finally had a sit down and called him out in February of 2024 (we told my mom an hour before just so she was aware and she was shocked and hurt). We pulled out the proof, I cried my eyes out telling him this stress has caused me to lose hair and have horrible jaw issues due to grinding and stress. He still did not seem to be that phased until my moms sister called him out for not even being upset.

Oh also his mistress is his cousins wife who he calls a brother. Knowing what my family has been through with my mom, it is kind blowing that she would think it’s fine to just ruin our lives even more (obviously my dads fault but he truly has the mentality of an 18 year old so I expect nothing less) 

Anyways, I’m getting married this June and we just caught them again!!! This time they’re talking through his work phone… he does not know that we know yet, but we have told my mom. The only message that wasn’t deleted was from the mistress stating “we have to wait until after her wedding” (meaning me, the oldest daughter). 

He has ruined my entire year and a half of wedding planning while we’ve all been secretly trying to figure out a plan for my poor mother. 
I’m praying that she will just divorce him but regardless this situation is so fucked up and I will never understand how a father can do this to his wife and his kids and not care. We had a great childhood so it’s just been absolutely devastating to live through this. 

I’d be open to any words of encouragement to help me try to enjoy my wedding while my poor moms world is crashing down. 

Thank you all

Fair-Conference-8801,I think I want kids one day,1,1c5nl9b,1,"Not the deepest thing in the world but growing up and maybe until.. a year ago? I was ADAMANT I never wanted kids. And even now it seems to come and go, but babies are gross, nappy (diaper) adverts even joke about the things babies 'produce' in there to show how good their products are. Then out in public, some kids just *scream* or when they have tantrums and I just have the urge to kick them over

And I have a good amount of mental illnesses, considering the track record of my relatives it's probably guaranteed my kid will have one or some of them. What if they're worse than I am and have more needs? I don't want to care for that. I'm hardly independent at 25, it could be so much worse! I haven't even had a partner, ever, you could hardly call one guy a boyfriend as we never even went on a date. I've never been on a date, let alone all the rest of the steps to an actual relationship.

Then the usual worries of would I be any good? What if I raise them badly? And how my older siblings say their friends feel chained by their kids, that's why they had them young to be free when they're older. Brilliant, so I won't be free when I'm older as this is meant to be my freedom but I'm unemployed, at home with my parents, and living through a recession that isn't getting any better! So with kids I get zero freedom until I've backache and don't want to do what I 'shouldve' done at my current age.

And yet.. kids look like good company. Their lack of knowledge is funny, and they surprise you, and maybe they'll be cuddly and everything will be nice. 

All my friends believe I'm so strongly against ever having children that I honestly can't even tell them I have these thoughts, I don't want to have that conversation. Truth is maybe they wouldn't care and would simply go ""Huh"" but just.. as I seem to be going through a phase of ""Oh kids could be a good idea"" I needed to vent this somewhere.",1713292423.0,

Throwaway267165,I'm scared to leave my room because of my father,4,1c5cwlm,15,"Throwaway...

My father has never been a great man. He never had a great family growing up (father left when he was young and abused his mother. His mother saw too much of his dad in him and neglected him. ) He claimed he always wanted a family of his own, but was never a good husband or father. 

He wanted a son, but had two daughters. He never tried to relate to us or really spend time with us. When we were little he was a shift worker, but then ended when I was 7. He lost his job, smoked alot (pot is illegal here) and smoked cigarettes. He wasn't involved with us kids or my mother, I never looked at them and thought ""thats what love looks like"". 

After losing his job he became depressed, my mother did everything to try and help him but nothing got through. I empathise alot because it's something I've struggles with my whole life as well, but he stopped trying, stopped living. He stayed in his room and played video games and smoked, that's all really. My mother had to do everything, she did shift work, got us up for school, cooked before she went to work, cleaned the house and payed for everything. Even when he got a job he didn't contribute to the household. 

Their relationship has always been rocky, for as long as I can remember really. I can remember telling her to find a divorce lawyer when I was young, but she loved him and we were poor. He got worse. He was scary and loud, always yelling at the drop of a hat. He became violent towards me and my sister one day, almost broke down my door. I thought she'd leave him but didn't. I don't think I'll ever forgive her for that. 

I moved away and stayed gone for 5 years. I only came back because I had no choice. After covid and the recession there was a rental crisis. My partner and I couldn't afford to live and it was come home or be homeless. Since being back I noticed he was watching male podcasts. How women should respect men, how men were the providers and women should be submissive and subservient. Sex has always been an issue. I remember being young and him telling me ""if you don't give a man what he wants, he'll get it somewhere else"" saying how it's not cheating because it's ""a wife's duty to provide sex"". It really f()cked me up. 

The podcasts have made everything worse. Even though he's not a provider by any traditional measurement he still believes he's entitled to all the ""benefits"" of ""being a man"". He believes the downfall of society is a woman's education and that it's a woman's job to produce children. He's also now on the bandwagon of ""it's only natural for men to desire younger women"" in relation to a man in his 40s or 50s dating an 18 year old (he has always been violently against such things until the podcasts) as well as ""it's only natural for men to have multiple partners and spread their seed, but women shouldn't sleep around as it makes them undesirable *like a car with a high podometer*"". It's honestly sickening. 

Him and my mother are now separated after a horrible series of events that involved both me and my sister (a bad argument nothing physical) he said I deserved to be hit, that women are all the same, that we're evil and my partner should ""watch out because he'll be next"". We're stuck living together because of the housing market, no one can afford to leave and my parents are to old to by houses themselves... so we're all stuck. 

Everything will be *tolerable* and civil and then he'll drop a bomb and start everything all over again. One second he's saying ""he understands his marriage is over and is okay with it"" to blowing up insisting everything is my mother fault, saying no one can be mad at him for his actions and behaviour the past *decade* because of the depression and insisting that he did nothing wrong. 

Today after everything has been civil and normal he sent her a request to watch a podcast called *Happy Wife School* which tells you how to be a good wife and keep a happy husband. I almost lost my damn mind. They're separated and he wanted her to change her last name and then he sends *this*! 

I can't live like this anymore, walking on eggshells, waiting for another blow up, worrying about losing the roof over my head or worse. But I don't have any options. We have no money, I'm currently working as a freelancer so I'm not in a very stable position and there just isn't a way out... I don't know what to do and I don't think I can live like this anymore...

unknownnacc,Advice please,1,1c5mxam,3,"This is literally the most cliche/teenage post ever just to warn lol

So I’m a 17 year old girl, and for some background, I’ve liked this boy for a year and 5 months and 2 weeks. I’m a pretty reserved (is that the word?) person, so while I have a lot of friends, I never told anyone. And I found out a few months ago that one of my friends liked him too, and she had told everyone but me in an outing they all went in but me before summer break which was the last time they all saw each other.

Now this boy, I kind of thought he might like me back because he used to try and talk to me often (with the stupidest excuses so it added to that) and would often look at me. But he’s pretty popular and I’m not and I know for a fact a lot of other girls like him. (I also looked him up on sm and saw he posted smth about girls with huge glasses looking good and it was at a time where I was wearing big glasses and when no other girls I knew were interested in him did).

I also feel really stupid because I always kind of think “why would he like me of all people? When there’s so many girls who like me who are prettier and funnier?” I’m not saying I’m ugly and boring, but I’m not the most stunning girl in school yk lmao

So yeah, maybe it’s stupid to post here but I legitimately have no one else to talk to about this, and I can’t even go to my friends because they’ll think I’m going for my friend’s crush when I’m not and I’ve really liked him for a year and a half.

CreeSaidWhat,I have to get it off my chest ,0,1c5mg2l,0,"I am going to try to make this short. But putting 5 years worth of trauma into a short narrative is heard. But here we go…
I (27F) decided last year when I was 4 months pregnant to leave my baby’s father. We had been together for 4 years at that point and I just gave up. The constant stress, pressure and struggle, I couldn’t take it anymore. 
I was the breadwinner in the relationship, my baby dad couldn’t keep a job and if he did he would always quit because he just didn’t want to work. I’ve always been very independent and can provide for myself. I took on this responsibility and paid for everything. The whole time we were together I had 2 jobs paying for everything we did. Trips out of town, nights out with friends, birthdays, holidays, you name it I paid for it. 
The love wore out rather quickly in my eyes the first 2 years I thought were great we were in love. But then we moved in together and quickly things changed. Arguing all the time, mostly about money because he wanted a lifestyle that I couldn’t afford. And then things started happening, he started staying out super late, people telling me he is cheating/talking to other people, then he became verbally abusive. I already know yall are mad cause why haven’t I left right? Well I felt bad because he had no family, he had no where to go. So I just stayed and thinking back on it I shouldn’t have cared where he went, if I told him to leave, after all the apartment was in my name. 
Fast forward to me being pregnant and the cycle continuing, now it’s nights he not coming home at all, sometimes days at time. Decided to “boycott” work and was gone with his other baby momma. We were facing eviction because of his dogs. And I’m fairly good with court proceedings and law, so I had a good defense on how to get the eviction dropped but the day of court I changed my mind because I was tired of living how I was living and seeing no way out. I knew my credit would be messed up but I didn’t care, I let us get evicted. It forced me to come back home to my parent’s house and I was able to get separated from him. 
I figured the time apart would do us good and we could work on our relationship. I was wrong, my whole pregnancy was argument after argument. Him telling me I’m really just a shity person. I didn’t let him be a man and all I did was put him down. And I just can’t wrap my head around that. How could I have put him down when I have made sure he had a place to lay his head, food on the table, cable to watch. I provided for him like I was his mom gave him money, he practically owned my car. I gave all of that up to just get away, my car got repoed I’m not paying a bill for something I don’t use. But nonetheless even when we were apart, he still treated me like shit. And I still tried to hang in there. But it’s only so much a person can take. The constant pressure because everything I said pissed him off and everything wrong in his life was my fault. I ended it for good in December 2023 I just couldn’t take it. We now have a daughter and he says I’m a horrible coparent but he doesn’t come get her and when does ask for her I let her go. He doesn’t send money, oh but he calls. He told me to never talk to him again and when our child gets old enough to talk he will come around. Like wtf

Fun_Construction6854,It has weighing  me alot 😮‍💨,1,1c5mdwf,0,"""Hey everyone, I wanted to share something personal with you all. Lately, I've been feeling really lost and overwhelmed. My ADHD is making it incredibly challenging for me to focus and communicate effectively. It's been tough keeping up with my four friends online: one takes forever to reply, another seems to get upset at the drop of a hat, the third often assumes a maternal role, and the fourth is dealing with their own struggles, making it hard to connect with them.

On top of that, my addiction to games and other stuff has taken a toll on me, causing me to lose everything – from money to respect and even my reputation at home. I'm coming to terms with the pain of self-awareness, realizing what's wrong and how to fix it, but my ADHD often holds me back from taking action.

It's like my mind is stuck in the past, and despite my efforts, nothing seems to be improving. Sometimes, it's hard not to feel like I'm just destined for trouble, as if all the problems in the world are somehow my fate.

Big_Attitude6868,I’m jealous of Zendaya,0,1c5m8rv,1,"I get so irrationally envious and jealous of girls who are  to be tomboys but have the freedom to explore their feminine side.

Growing up I was a tomboy who also enjoyed princess dresses and playing with dolls. However after consistently hearing from my mom that I was a tomboy, that I was dirty, that I was unladylike I internalized that and I felt unworthy of femininity. I felt as though I was only allowed to explore that tomboy nature and the masculine side of my self. I often felt as though whenever I chose to explore my feminine side I was never a ”Girling”good enough. Often times I was mocked or chastised for wearing girly clothes because I was going to make them dirty, sit in a way that does not fit the outfit or engage in behaviors that would be unbecoming in such attire. I was often excluded from taking pictures or participating in very girly activities and was encourage to rather do the boys things because I was already so comfortable in that role,  so growing up I relegated myself to spaces and clothing I felt most comfortable in. 

However when I came of age and got to experience my feminine side I loved it. I reveled in being able to truly enjoy it and explore it without judgment. I loved wearing the dresses, the skirts, and still getting to be myself.  However I really struggle with being able to truly engage in the basic girly girl parts of me. I am so jealous of the girls who got to be models and do ballet and dance etc.  I judge other girls who truly lean into their influencer side mainly because I can’t do it. I don’t wish them ill will or anything I just get overwhelming feelings of envy when I see them slaying. And my immediate visceral reaction to seeing the pictures are largely negative and I hate that about myself.

An example would be someone like Zendaya who gets to look homeless, where athletic shorts under dresses and yet still enjoy fashion, taking pictures being a girly girl in public. Irrational anger and jealousy flows through my veins when I see how comfortable I could have been with my tomboy side and my feminine side had I been encouraged and not mocked as a child. I sometimes feel very resentful of my mom because she forced certain parts of femininity on me and denied me access to the parts which I felt more interested in resulting in my very complicated relationship with femininity .   Her inability to understand my duality has led to my inability to connect to both sides.


I am working on it, I’m trying to access it, I think the hardest part is getting myself to do the things that I find myself jealous of other people doing and sticking with it even when I suck. It’s a process. I don’t blame my mom, she did what she thought was best however I do Have moments of deep resentment towards her and the difference in how my sister was allowed to explore femininity versus how I was unallowed to.",1713289235.0,

AnonymousBunny96,I just wish everything would stop being so hard…,1,1c5m7ob,0,"2024 is *not* my year… these last 6 months have been the hardest I’ve ever experienced.

In November ‘23, I cut off a friendship of 4 years because they were incredibly abusive to me. Manipulating, gas lighting, berating, mining me for resources, inviting me places out of obligation when I wasn’t actually wanted there. I wasn’t even a human being to them...

Thing is, that whole network of friends was a cult. I’m not being hyperbolic, either. I’ve read the BITE model. Manipulating behavior through reward and punishment, limiting individual autonomy, distorting information or withholding it deliberately and lying, controlling thoughts to promote conformity, manipulating emotions through love bombing and guilt… they were no Heaven’s Gate, but all the boxes are checked. All centered around the aforementioned friend.

So I didn’t just lose them, or even their kids who I’d come to love so dearly, pouring every ounce of myself into their well-being, but I lost an entire support system and network of friends…

To make matters worse, when I realized what was happening and cut this person off, I expressed to my husband that I didn’t want to associate with them anymore. I didn’t want to leave *my* house every time they so much as called, knowing it would be about me and I would never be free of them. At length he conceded and cut them off “for me” and immediately blamed me for everything he had lost, that he only did it because he was told by me and others that it was the “correct” thing to do, but he couldn’t articulate for himself why.

Then I realized that, our entire 15 year relationship together, I had done all the heavy lifting, spoon feeding him every decision he’d ever made. I had given him so much love and support and help and I got none of it. When we sat down and talked about it he expressly said he wasn’t interested in hearing about what I’m reading, watching, interested in my writing until I had “actually finished something”.

I decided we needed to separate and the conversation became every thing he had done correctly and everything I had done wrong, and how he wasn’t going to “let” me hurt him this way. For *hours*, until I was so tired I was ready to just give in, go back home, sit on a shelf and be a perfect little wife… But I didn’t.

I’ve been staying at a friend’s house. For 3 months I waffled on whether he would show me he would change and grow without me there or if I should just call it quits and file for divorce… but he made that decision for me when he served me the day I went to pick up my stuff from our apartment in front of god and everyone. That day also confirmed he had reconnected with the person who had hurt me so badly for years, which he’d have known was irreconcilable.

They were the wrong papers and I told him so, gave him step by step instructions for filing. Still having to hold his hand… and then a month and a half later he sent me the same papers *again*.

So I filed, had him served, and now he just needs to respond. He has till the end of the week, but I doubt he will…

The apartment I applied for has required the most hand holding of any property management company I’ve ever worked with… and after a month of reaching out about paying my deposit, the only word I get from them is they are pushing my move in date a week.

To make matters worse, the friend I’ve been staying with still wants me out by the original date, so I had to find another place to stay because they were “having guests over.” Which doesn’t make sense to me considering they’ve had guests from out of state before and I have happily given up the room to them without having to leave… I know they aren’t doing anything wrong, and it’s totally fair and it was always going to be temporary, and… and… and…

And on top of all that my passport got delivered to my old address (because wtf is mail forwarding for, right? Not that it matters because I have to go to the post office and give them documentation of my current address since I tried to change it to my new apartment’s address less than 6 months after I forwarded it to my friend’s address, except I don’t *have* any documents with my friend’s address because this was always gonna be temporary…) so now I have to arrange some kind of hand off with my ex or I have to apply ally over again which I can’t because my primary document ALSO got sent to my old address because wtf is mail forwarding for?

I am just so tired… I’m so fucking tired and angry all the time…

gymros,"I don't know if my family's past is the reason why I'm scared of driving
",1,1c5m39f,3,"any answers would help me greatly

SO as the title states, I'm terribly scared of driving, well I used to be until I got my license and I think it may have to do with my family's past. Basically, I got my license fairly recently, November 2023 and before, that of course I had to learn how to drive, except it was an absolute nightmare. There wasn't a single lesson where I wouldn't cry. No matter how gentle and kind the instructor I was always living through my worst nightmare when I was driving. And it wasn't just your average beginner anxiety it was way worse, it was a deep profound fear of driving causing an accident and dying. And I never really understood why I was so afraid of driving, I had no reason to, I never got into any accident when I was younger and I never really witnessed one. Until I thought about this :  when I was little, around 2 years old, my father's best friend who was also my godfather, died in a car/motorbike accident, right in front of our family house. Worst part being is that, my grandfather was drunk driving and crashed into him, killing him... But the thing is, I don't remember anything, I was too little, I don't even remember my godfather's face or even his voice. I never really knew him either since I was too small and he died before I even grew up. But my mother brought it up when I told her that driving made me sick to my stomach. In a way it can make sense because why else would I be so scared? But then again is it really possible that I got traumatized by something I don't even remember? That I haven't like LIVED through? Is it possible that it's the reason for me being scared to death when it comes to driving? I honestly have no idea, it may be a silly idea to think this affected me when I haven't really lived through it but well, it may be my only lead. I had to get this off my chest because it raises so many questions to which I don't have the answer.

Silent-Owl-1589,"I've been lying to my friends all my life, and the guilt is terrifying.",1,1c5lykd,2,"Just a quick trigger warning: Mentions of NSFW and mentions of SH.

Of course, this is a burner, I just need to get this out of my mind, because I've been stressing for days.


I'm young, and since I've been on the internet at all, I've lied about myself, either lying about terrible things to get attention, to impress others, to genually trick myself, or to even try to connect with people.
Even in real life, when I was a kid, I always lied about vacation destinations I supposedly had gone to, or things that I had, when in reality I'm from a poor family.


I don't understand *why* exactly I started doing this, but I didn't really acknowledge it as anything bad for the longest time.


It started with trying to ""be cool"" by saying I did things like self-harm, smoking, addictions, etc; and saying that I had depression, to fit in with others and to be acknowledged.


Most of my friendships ended up in both me and the other person forgetting and never talking again, I had a couple of relationships, and I was left hurt badly because I felt too much when they decided to leave me, because of course, relationships between teenagers do not last in a random multiplayer game.


I was introduced to nsfw things at a younger age, and even began engaging in nsfw role-playing scenarios and whatnot with people, because I was influenced by them, because ""everyone did it"", and again, I was trying to appeal to ""everyone"".
With that, my sense of ""right and wrong"" really took a hit. I did things I shouldn't, I influenced others badly, and I made people feel weird.


I was in a cycle of friendships and etc, some lasted longer than others, my stories about myself kept getting worse and worse with each person, and I was solely looking for attention at this point. I even faked my age, how I looked, traumas I didn't have, and addictions.


I have real scars from stupid accidents that I made up fake stories for: talking about being stabbed on the chest, about self-harming; which all of that was fake, and I was so into it, I basically did not even think I was lying, somehow?
I was enjoying my persona, people cared about me, and I felt good about it, but I never truly connected with anyone, since they liked who I pretended to be, not myself.


Now, foward to 2 years later, I've met people that I really appreciate genually, but I lied to them all as well from the start, that's what I always did, no matter what person it was.
I didn't just lose contact with them like everyone else, and we became close, or atleast they did with my persona.
I've confessed a lot of lies to them once I did some introspection from nowhere, but I didn't confess to everything, despite promising them that I actually did, and that there were no more lies. I was a coward, I lied again, I didn't confess the ones I knew they'd really hate me for.. 


The guilt is horrible, It's like a switch was turned on in my head and I realized the horrifying level of my lies, I was terrible, and I hurt others deeply because of it.
I've tried my best, I deleted accounts that I once had fake personalities in, I couldn't apologize to some people, it was too hard.
Every time I think about a lie, I find another that I told, and another one, and.. you get the point. I just kept digging up my own grave, and I cried, realizing how bad it actually was, and how my friend would feel if I told them about the rest of the lies.


I wish I never had lied to them, or everyone at this point.
I never thought of myself as ""worthy"" in a way to be liked, mainly due to having ADHD and being an introvert, so I needed this mask for people to care about me, despite that not being true, because some people do care about me, but I was too blind to understand that.
I was content with my lies before, even though I was only fooling people.
I don't understand why, maybe it was a way to disconnect from who I was?


I don't even have any major traumas, although my household isn't that great, (fatherless, daily vocal fights between family members, some temporary neglect when i was a kid), it wasn't that bad either.
I was bullied since 1st grade until 9th grade, but it wasn't really ""bullying"", because I probably was only overreacting. I grew numb to it eventually and moved schools for 10th grade.


I'm honestly just a piece of shit, I hate the fact that I can't fully come clean to my friend, because I know my friend won't forgive me a second time, since yhey said it themselves, and they shouldn't either.


I realized I am incredibly selfish for this, they deserve to know the truth, and I keep thinking that I deserve to keep them, after everything I've lied about, and how I hurt them.
I've betrayed their trust, I basically exploited them for emotional support, and I've tried my hardest to be truthful (which I've been doing with a struggle).
But the guilt of everything else I never came clean about is always keeping me awake, even if there's no way of them finding out, I feel guilty for deceiving them, and I hope I'm able to be better.


Thank you for reading this post, this is giving me constant anxiety, but I know I'm 100% at fault here.

QuanChaghan,I love my boyfriend. But I also love another.,0,1c5llgi,5,"I apologise in advance for the length of this post, I don't know how to keep a story short.

I (27, M) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (27, M) for four years. We live together and are very happy in our little Parisian life (I live in France).

We've been in an open relationship for a year now, and have no regrets about it. We like this arrangement, and it's allowed each of us to develop sexual and romantic relationships with other guys, while still coming home to one another every night. 

That's not the problem. I have a best friend, who we'll call L (26, M). 

L and I have known each other for a few years, we're fundamentally different, but I just love everything about him. He's one of the most positive and gentle person I know. He's handsome, very fit, tall, caring and has the most amazing smile. L and I are a bit more than friends. We flirt together, he seduces me, I seduce him, I think about him before I go to sleep, we send each other nudes and videos, we sext together, we tell each other how much we miss each other (we don't live close to each other). He tells me that he'd like to be with me, that he'd like to live with me. This has been going on for as long as we've known each other. Except that six months ago L got in a relationship with someone he met on Tinder, who we'll call A (24, M). 

Since L met A, he's been glowing, and I'm really happy for him. However, our relationship has remained the same, despite him saying he wants to be serious and plan long term with A.  
But one day, A went through his phone and discovered some of our conversations. L told me what happened, crying in my arms, not knowing what to do. He loves him and doesn't want A to leave him. 

The next day I got a message from L: ""He left me, it's all your fault, you've ruined my life, I never want to hear from you again"". Then nothing. He ghosts me. He blocked me on every social platform, with no way of contacting him. Pure silence. 

I spent sleepless nights checking my phone every hour to see if I had received a message from him. I couldn't eat, I didn't have the energy for anything. At work, I watched each minute go by, trying not to think about him at every second that passed. I wondered how he was doing, and the pain he must have felt. I came home at night, curled up on the sofa with a knot in my stomach, and I tried to sleep as much as I could so I didn't think about him. I tried not to look at his Twitter profile, or Instagram, to which I had no longer have access. I tried not to reread our conversations or look at our photos. I waited for it to pass. And little by little, I felt better. 

All of this was happening while my boyfriend, whom I still loved very much, watched me wither away every night. I realised that my best friend was more than that, and that I was probably in love with two people at the same time.

That was three years ago. I'm still with my boyfriend, whom I love from the bottom of my heart. My feelings for him have never changed. I want to spend as much time as possible with him. 

Yet L is always somewhere in the back of my mind. Just when I think I'm over him, he comes back to me in my dreams, or appears on my Twitter feed (he unblocked me but we don't follow each other). I don't look at his profile on social medias, I don't look at our photos, I don't read our past conversations. And yet there's always a trace of him in some corner of my mind. 

I should probably mention that L came back to talk to me a year ago. He asked how we'd got to this point, and said he'd ""forgotten everything"". He doesn't remember anything about us, he says it has to do with the ADHD diagnosis he's been given the past year. He's still with his boyfriend who, I learned, knows almost nothing about the extent of the relationship we had before. I was able to finally tell him how I felt, I explained the place he had in my life and the pain I felt when we fell apart. I also told him that I had experienced this situation as a break-up, while also being in a relationship with the other man I love.

Despite my lengthy explanation, he just replied that he hadn't suffered in the least. In short, the discussion we had led nowhere, and it didn't allow me to get the closure I needed to move on. 

I would like to get rid of this pain that just keeps coming back to me in waves. I choose my words carefully when I 'm telling you that a part of me died the day he told me I had ruined his life. Since then, I've felt an emptiness inside me, in the place in my heart that was dedicated to him. I thought that time would ease the pain I feel, and that the love I had for him would die out as the months went by.

But it hasn't. I love him as much as I did three years ago, I miss him, and I don't know what to do to get rid of him. I don't see him, I don't talk to him, I don't follow him on any social media, I don't read any of our conversations, I don't look at any of our photos, and yet the feelings I have for him remain.

Now, I completely understand that giving back to the community is important, but here's the thing. The school won't let us choose where to volunteer and what to volunteer. I am totally okay with working as an engineer or a programmer in a non-profit, that sounds fun! But! The school forces all of us to go rake leaves at places we've never been to or even heard of before. Talking about community when it's not even YOUR COMMUNITY. It's an at least two hour drive from school!

And those places are entitled af. They treat us like we are paid employees, bossing us around telling us to work harder, and ""the ground is not clean enough, rake harder"" when we've already worked 4 to 5 hours raking leaves non-stop. We are paying 80k a year to go to this high school, a school that cares only about money and ""reputation"" and never about the well-being of students. Talking about giving back to the community when all the school does is taking from us lol.

  
Not only that, but the school tells us all the time to ""contribute to the school"" because the school has contributed so much to us.

Any_Presentation7761,I have to start teaching at my university in the fall and I feel completely unprepared.,1,1c5likw,0,"I hope this is the right place. I don’t know where to start so I guess I’ll just give some background. My whole life I’ve lived in an area that pretty much only has one major accredited university. You’ve got the town around it, a relatively normal college town, surrounded by poorer regions of underfunded public schools. Given my own financial instability living in these surrounding regions, I kinda didn’t have a choice but to go to this university. The school has a high acceptance rate because it pushes initiatives awarding scholarships to students who achieve a certain GPA, alongside some other requirements. Still, not a lot of students take it seriously, and get in without trouble. I won’t pretend it was easy or whatever, but I got in and was awarded several scholarships. I went through my entire undergrad never having to pay a dime for tuition. I received a pretty good undergrad education for an unheard of rate. I’m not mentioning this to brag or prove my worth as a student, but I do want to stress that this university was pretty much the only way for me (and many others) to get a bachelor’s (in- and out-of-state) without going into debt or borrowing loans.

Anyway, as I went through undergrad, I knew that I wanted to go to grad school. Always did. I was in a great program for foreign language, definitely an under-appreciated discipline in the area, and my professors were supportive and did so much to hype me up when I told them I wanted to enter our school’s master’s program for this subject. I loved research and literature and wanted nothing more than to go into a grad program that reflected these interests; it was something I wanted for myself since I was 16. I should also add that during this time, I lived with my family, and it was a living situation I was desperate to get away from. I felt that my interest in this discipline was all I had, and I grew closer with my professors the higher up I went and the smaller my classes became.

Then, my senior year (may have been my junior), my school cut the grad program I was working towards. They also basically told me that, being the sole major for that department, I would be the last to get an undergad in this program as well. I was completely devastated. And frankly, my area gave little opportunity for work within the field despite how sorely we lack foreign language advocacy. All I had was experience teaching this material as an academic tutor, and this only got me so far. Even applications for completely unrelated job roles that don’t require a bachelor’s are rejected almost immediately. This was when I began to panic. I met with my department professors and advisor, asked about possible work experience, and was basically told that short of middle and high school teaching, I didn’t have much going for me. They pointed me to some great out-of-state universities as well, but I knew that if my experience couldn’t land me a job, my CV just wasn’t enough.

Flash forward to the end of my senior year and I get rejected from every out-of-state school I applied to. Panic. On one side I have a family who loves me but deeply disrespects and shames me, a family I’m so eager to get away from (another story altogether) and on the other I have the increasingly heavy realization that I am not prepared enough for the world. I feel stupid, I feel afraid of being even more poor, and I ultimately feel like I’ve bet on the wrong horse.

Well, if you can’t beat ‘em, you come crawling back. Lacking any fruitful job prospects and growing increasingly strained with my family, I applied to my university’s English MA program. I’m poor as hell, so I signed up for an assistantship which covers 75% of tuition and decided that even if I was accepted into the program, I wouldn’t enroll unless I also got that position and its accompanying tuition waiver. And I did.

I’ll have completed my first year of my two-year program in a couple weeks, and for the fall I’ll be teaching incoming freshmen in a basic English essay-writing class. These students are those who have scored the lowest on standardized tests and/or have the lowest GPAs. Over this spring I’ve been enrolled in a class designed to help me prepare for teaching them, but our last class has come and gone and I feel completely unprepared. I feel so unprepared that if I start thinking about teaching in the fall I have panic attacks. I could get into the details of that class but the professor was just incredibly disorganized. He has taught 101 for over a decade and doesn’t understand how it might be challenging. I’ve made assignment sheets, lesson plans, unit plans, PowerPoints, discussion boards, syllabi, all in anticipation for this class I’ll be teaching, but I have received no feedback, and my and my classmates’ questions are either hand-waved away or danced around. At the same time, I’ve spent my first year of grad school tutoring English students, and it’s really opened my eyes to the profound gaps in early public education. I've had tutoring sessions where I just work on showing students when and how to indent paragraphs.

I don’t know. I’m trying to be self-aware, and I understand that the fact I’m even able to choose whether I borrow loans makes me incredibly fortunate. Also, at a base level, I understand that this opportunity to teach would be a great learning experience for me, and it’s more conducive to the work experience I wish I’d been able to get as an undergrad. However, knowing that I and my peers, who have no teaching experience, will be focused on teaching the most underserved, neglected, and fucked-over students in my region makes me feel so worried about messing up, and so angry at the public education system that has failed them so far. I don’t care about the subject matter, but I’m not in a position where I can express that to students. It doesn’t matter to me, but it absolutely needs to matter to them. I feel like I’m the last person who should be in a position of authority here, like I genuinely can’t bring myself to believe in a system that I know from my top-down view doesn’t really work. I feel so burnt-out and disillusioned that I’ve given up on working in that field for the time being. I’m now solely focused on getting through this teaching, no matter how it absolutely terrifies me.

I feel so lost, like all the resolve I've carried with me the past decade is just gone. How do I care? How do I set aside my baggage and get over myself? How do I assert authority over these incoming students without being out-of-touch, overbearing, or an asshole?",1713287512.0,

Im 18f he is 17m, he is chubby i am overweight but we love each other and reassure how much we love each others face and image. Idk it just hurts me but i don’t have an easy time communicating my feelings at all so i will keep this for me, he is an amazing bf and I know harder times will come and so I’ll let the hard talks for topics that actually deserve the attention and not my dumb insecurities.

majordonkuss,my mom has cancer and ive never been this scared in my life,1,1c5klmf,0,"Well.. its just as the title says. She has been the only constant in my whole life. When she told me she has stage 3 colon cancer i literally couldn't speak or think or anything. I've dealt with anxiety, depression and suicidal tendencies for 10+ years now but hearing that had to be worse than most ive experienced. Throughout all my hardships in life she has been my rock in rough waters. To hear that the most loving, strong and giving person in my life has been diagnosed with this horrible disease is worse than any fear I've had yet, like I've never even thought that could happen. I always pictured me and her living in a house together as old people like the golden girls, that was and still is the goal. i know life isnt guaranteed but now that dream is so shakey i never realized how much that fantasy has kept me going through out the years. Idk what to do.. I know she needs me and needs support and she does have it as she is such an amazing person she cultivated an amazing circle and community around her. But she has always been the planner, the giver, the rock of our whole family. I know i need to step up but im so god awfully scared and i cant think or speak about it seriously without becoming a whole mess and thats not what she needs right now. I'm not even the one with cancer and im dealing with it so horribly.. this is only the second time in my life where i can tell/hear/see that she is scared too.. idk im not even looking for advice i just cant even speak to anyone irl about this right now. everyone always says the same thing and nothing helps i just feel so helpless and useless",1713285310.0,
Free-Ad9710,When I failed in 9th class and now I'm scared to approach my old friends,1,1c5k8su,0,"So, the story goes like this.  It was time of lockdown and I was pretty much messed up in studies.  To be honest, I was addicted to games, and watching porn as well.  Before getting into all of those addictions, I was a very good student, used to come in top 5 of the class and this is my story of downfalling.  When lockdown started, people were in home and there were online classes, I used to just mess around, used to mute the tab in which online classes were going on and then usual just watching youtube and messing around, never paid attention in the Class.  After some months, schools opened and classes became normal in person but I never went there.  I used to lie to my dad about it that I'm going there but I really wasn't going, I used to stay home and watch Tv-Shows, I was really addicted.  So, the annual exams came, usually they don't pass who fails even 1 subject, if they do then they've to give supplementary exams.  If you got passing marks on that, you'll be promoted, otherwise repeat the year.  I gave my exams, I got 2 supplementaries in Maths and Science both but still I thought like it was a piece of cake but it wasn't.  I failed in that as well and I made a mockery of myself.  It's not like only I was failed, 9 people gave supplementary exams and only 2 were able to pass it.  I was ashamed of myself, the day when my Dad came  home after final results, he was very sad like he never expected me to fail a class.  He just blamed me for it, It was okay to blame me because It was my fault, after that I tore the result paper and It was just the beginning.    


News spread like fire in the class, people started making gossips about me particularly, because I was so intelligent they didn't even believe the teacher.  After some time, they got to know about it.  One of my friends told me ""Well that teacher told us that you left studies now and you are working somewhere hiding in the corner"".  I said well maybe, my self esteem was already broken by the failure and to avoid more teasing, I deleted that social media account permanently and when things were normal again, I came back with new account.  People started asking me about what I was doing and Was I repeating the class, to some I lied, to some I told truth.  Time went like in a blink of an eye and I don't know how to even greet them, I still fear inferior to them, I don't know but I feel.  Whenever someone recognize me in the market, they start screaming my name but I don't know how to respond that, I fear, my legs tremble like hell... I ignore them.  ",1713284455.0,
No-Set3147,My dad asked me to pick out lingerie for my mom.,1,1c5k5sm,1,"When I was a teenager my Dad would occasionally bring me a VS catalogue near holidays and ask if I could pick out some bras/panties my mom would like and then to place the order for him, along with some specific items he picked.

terratwice,My boyfriend probably over sexualizes me ,82,1c4q4wo,45,"Sometimes it doesn’t even feel like he’s 28 because of the way he talks or acts. And the fact that he isn’t mindful of what he says. 

It’s been 3 months together and I’m worried because the other day we were on a date and talking about what we like sexually. I was saying I like sucking him off bc I love him and he was rlly into it when suddenly he says “yea you can suck off my friend too”. At that point I let go of his hand and say “what? No, I would never. what’s wrong with you…” And he instantly regrets it and grabs my hand back and starts saying he’s sorry. I ask him why he would say that and he says he “doesn’t know” and agrees it was weird. I’d never done something like a BJ before, he’s my first for everything but that just made me regret ever trying it. 

Another time I was disclosing the ways my sibling was mentally abusive to me with one of my earliest memories being my sibling putting me in a dog cage for hours and calling me ugly when I was about 5. And I guess he thought it was sexy to say he would do the same to me now even though I’ve told him I’m insecure about my looks. I again let him know that was really insensitive to say and once again he apologizes. 

Last weird thing he’s done is I was telling him I was a teachers aid and he started going on about how if I was his teacher, he would’ve paid attention to me all the time and before the conversation could get weird I just interrupted him and said we would’ve never been together because I’m not a predator and I’m extremely against that stuff. It worries me that he’s also commented that he would’ve caught a case for me because we are 5 years apart and right now it doesn’t matter bc I’m 23, but the fact he was talking about when I was a high schooler is disgusting


I’m trying to forgive him because he is a good person but I suspect that he oversexualizes me. I’m not a perfect person but he’s never had me apologize to him so far in this relationship because I just don’t make weird comments to him. I don’t want to end this relationship so soon but I worry for the future. Because I won’t always be young and if it’s only me being young and “hot” that he likes, then this relationship isn’t unconditional. ",1713197544.0,

Ok-Hippo509,“Ex” screamed at me about being a pillow princess while me and my boyfriend were working out,118,1c4nefm,15,"Title basically explains it, boyfriend (21M) and I (21F) went for a late night workout at one of those stationary park gyms in my small childhood town. I’ve been struggling mentally lately and doctors/therapists have encouraged me to exercise outside. When we got there, some dudes were hanging out on the playground across the way. I just shrugged them off as teenagers. When we started working out with some glute bridges, one of them yelled at me “hey pillow princess!” And jeered at my boyfriend when he started doing his reps calling him a pillow princess too. We both just took a deep breath and ignored them. I figured they were bored kids making fun of us for glute bridges. Turns out they were grown ass adults.

Later, they all piled into a car and left. As they pulled away, one of them name dropped me out of the window, screaming “still a pillow princess, huh, (my name)?!” I recognized his voice pretty quick. 

I put “ex” in quotations because we only went on one date back in high school which he pressured me into. This “thing” lasted a week at most and we never came close to having sex. In fact, I distinctly remember him talking about sex and me saying I /wasn’t/ comfortable with it yet (I have a history of s/a) and he got upset with me for it.

When he yelled that out the window, I was incredibly upset. I met my boyfriend in college and we’ve been in a healthy relationship for a year now - my first ever healthy relationship, and I’ve been doing a lot of healing from high school. He’s not from my area, so I’ve been recently falling back into love with my childhood town while showing him around. But now, I hate it here even more. I figured everyone from high school had dispersed and I wouldn’t ever run into high school drama again. I broke down in tears immediately. My boyfriend pulled me into him and was shaking with anger, which is incredibly rare. The man doesn’t get angry.

I was so embarrassed that all this happened in front of him. He doesn’t judge me for my past, he’s really upset that it happened and he’s been incredible ever since last night making sure I feel safe, secure, and loved. 

I just feel sick that it happened and I want to leave this place asap.",1713190766.0,
Petmomma12,"Grandmother rented to husband and I, never told in the beginning it was temporary now “it was always supposed to be temporary”",0,1c5k1yq,3,"So I (now f27 [my birthday was yesterday]) just found something shocking out yesterday. My grandmother is selling her property that we live on. Now, we knew about this for months, but she has been going back and forth always changing her mind between selling and renting (she has two houses on property) and staying. I don’t know what to do we’re honestly going to be homeless and I’ve been almost nonstop crying since I found out.

My (m34) and I have multiple dogs and renting where we live is so expensive if you have dogs and they want almost 6x rent as income and a nearly perfect credit score so when we were looking to move out of my parents house, where we were paying rent also, we asked my grandmother and she said we could rent out my childhood home on the property which is a “3 bedroom” 1100sqft house for the same price we were paying for a 350sqft bedroom and we were beyond grateful. We both had pretty steady jobs, we weren’t out of work without getting something (I had a workplace injury and had to go on workman’s comp for almost 8mos last year), but we still made everything work when money was extremely tight. Then in about August of last year we found out that I have a 4.3cm brain cyst and from getting that diagnosis a couple months later my husband wanted me to quit working and go on medical leave due to the nature of our work. We work in the healthcare industry and I was constantly getting beat on by my patients, so he was scared I’d have another episode related to the cyst and or die at work. I went to my doctor and she put me on disability, trying not to but she was also trying to take my license which would mean I couldn’t work anyway (live too far away for it to be feasible to get rides) so she agreed to it. She didn’t end up taking my license either because I was completely in control behind the wheel and my husband was working more so that automatically meant I wasn’t going to be driving a lot anyway.

About a month into disability my husband’s heart dog died and that was a crushing time, thankfully he didn’t actually have to go to work (more hours in the day less days per week) because it was the first of his days off(this detail will be important later). Well about a day later my mom asks us to take in a dog that she can’t take in because it tried to attack her dog and it wasn’t a safe environment for her household. My husband made the decision to take it in because they were saying that otherwise it was going to be euthanized (it was a older puppy with absolutely no training because it’s “its own person”) and my husband hated hearing that. 
Well about two weeks into having him he attacked our fixed male dog because playing got rough, husband was again not scheduled due to his scheduled days off so he didn’t lose work from having to deal with this. We end up keeping the dog because everything seemed fine a few hours later.
A month passes and everything is fine everyone is fine with one another and my husband’s only missing work because he goes in sick and gets sent home because he’s sick, so not calling out (again, important). Mid January I have another episode where I pass out and have seizure like movements (no its not epilepsy) when my husband is on his way to work, I come to to the dogs fighting again but am able to break it up and separate them. I call my husband and tell him about the fainting and he calls work and apologizes that its so last minute but he needs to take me to the doctor and or be there for me because of my medical issue (we worked in the same place so they understood). Comes home and I tell him about the dogs. However, he does get into an accident on the way home which dislodged two of his front teeth but I was glad he was okay. He also later that day got the day off the next day because of my health problems. A few days later the dogs get into it again but we give it back because my husband didn’t feel safe with it here. He thought he could rehab it but no.
The next day his mouth is swollen and he can’t talk so we go to the dentist and they say that the four front teeth need to come out and he needs partial dentures. We didn’t have the money or insurance to take care of it so we didn’t call the specialist. 
However during this time, work terminated him due to absenteeism stating he’d been calling in so much and missing work, counting the times he got sent home by supervisors as part of it. We told my grandmother about it and she’s been lenient with the rent saying we could pay her when we have more money and he could do housework for her in exchange for some of it which he has been doing but she also is paying people to do everything she wants him to do so there isn’t a lot of work.
We’ve been trying to get him unemployment but the system locked him out and the line is always too busy so we’ve been living on my disability for about three months because even though he gets interviews no one wants to hire someone with missing teeth.
So that brings us to now. I don’t know what’s going on cause we haven’t talked to her in full, but most likely we’ll be homeless cause every option in the family is not available to us. I’m not posting for anything but to get it off my chest cause it’s still raw.",1713283974.0,

Unfortunately, I can no longer give him a comfortable life due to financial reasons. My sister offered to take him in since she was looking to get another cat. She has a cat of her own and I know she can give my cat a wonderful life. I agreed because I'd rather he go with someone that I trust than a stranger. 
I said goodbye to him this morning and sent him on his way. She lives across the country so it won't be easy to see him. After this morning I just went about my day. It's not until now, that I'm in my bed, I started crying. I miss him so much it hurts. I wish I didn't have to send him away but he'll have a much better life than I can give him right now. Even when I'm in a better position I won't be taking him back. I don't want to take him away after he gets used to being there with his new family. I won't be adopting any more pets after this either. 
At the end of all of this, nothing else matters but his happiness and well being. If it means sacrificing a chunk of my happiness then so be it. I know my sister and her husband will treat him well and love him. I hope nothing but the best for them.

juliangelistic,Religion is ruining the view on my same-sex relationship,0,1c5jknh,3,"So, me and my girlfriend are going strong , being together for 7 months we managed to climb through and deal with our traumas together. But what is messing with me personally at the moment is my way of thinking and its stopping me from growth and makes me feel depressed to move forward. 

Context:  2 months ago I engaged out of curiosity  about a lot of ex-gay testimonies and regardless of being raised in a Muslim household these were Christian testimonies but it did not matter. I was agnostic and I still kinda feel like it. After I started consuming and researching how their behavior worked, I went too deep into the rabbit hole to find excuses for myself why homosexuality is wrong. I started hating myself so much, and this brought a distance between my relationship(until I communicated my issues). Never in my life I had such, traditional and close minded way of thinking until now. I felt trapped, and it was a constant battle between my religion and this girl. But then I snapped out of nowhere and was like 'is God really worth it to let her go? What if the gay never prays away and u live an utterly depressing life?'. So Im trying to fight through this freling, but there is a voice in my body always ready to convince me Im wrong and I spend almost every single day on google asking if my homosexuality is okay.

So these are my thoughts, which I never had before but there they are: 

I feel guilty dating her , and that is probably because she is a girl. i cant enjoy my relationship peacefully without thinking how she is a woman and i cant be a woman the way a woman is to a man. and im scared that one day we will have to seperate because her future is different than mine and she deserves to be with a guy and i do too because its wrong and i dont know. i dont want to because i love her so much, yet i feel guilty being in this relationship. like i just wonder about how i cannot make her happy or fullfilled like a way a man can. or that because of my female anatomy it is wrong to engage in sexual relations with a female since it is off putting, weird and ""forced"" to meet a heteronormative standard, aka to force one of you to be a man in the relationship so u can truly be happy.  i feel so wrong but even if she makes me happy, that feeling of guilt comes back because i start thinking about how wrong it is for 2 girls to be together. i cant tell this to her because im scared of her reaction and i did nothing wrong and i see the future with this girl but i constantly think about how we are not gonna be forever because of the toxic circumstances and everything like that. it burdens me and i hate it and i want to get therapy but i dont have the financial support for it so im currently begging for help",1713282840.0,

SouthernCoyote2611,"I feel like I am stuck in my life, especially with my job search",2,1c5e8n2,0,"Hey guys,  


I am going to try and be as brief as possible but I feel like I need to share insight to possibly help me out. I'm sorry in advance.  


Around 18 months ago, I moved across the country because my partner got a new job, that honestly sparked their flame with their career again. Before I moved, I had a decent job at a small company, enough to pay the bills. Since moving here, I have struggled with finding employment, the area is near a large US city but we live in an area where if I drive 5 minutes up the road, people act like I walked in tundra to get to their house.   


Anyways, I have found 2 employers. The first, I seem to really click with, however after I joined the company. I realized they were essentially running the department into the ground. It's hard to give specifics but when I asked why they were doing things a certain way, I was met with swift and hard talking too's. Honestly, I wasn't being too critical, I just had a lot more experience than even the managers who were my bosses...not a brag. I don't look to be the smartest in the room ever. Anyways, I eventually was let go a day before my birthday. 

The second employer I found, I thought was going to be heaven on earth. I spent over 2 months interviewing for an entry level position, but it was worth it. The unfortunate turn to this story is the first day I started, they let me know that the person that was going to be my boss, left for another job. They did not tell me until after I signed paperwork and this person was not a normal plug in manager this was a Vice President at the company. I was shocked that they even hired me. I literally told them "" I am surprised you guys still hired me"" Of course, that also last about a month before they realized they couldn't replace a VP in 2 weeks or really have anything for me to do with him gone, as all my interviews were tailored to this person's department and without him.. they were lost literally.  
I now find myself in the most difficult point in my life, with an almost 2 year gap on my resume. Since I cannot put jobs that I ""held"" for around a month or let alone quantify my impact as there has literally been none unfortunately. I am young and got caught up in my final years of college dealing with COVID.   
I have gotten some decent interviews but can't close out to save my life. The gap explaining is hard, I have never said I was let go and then laid off 8 months later in the same amount of job time. That makes me look like a chump and damaged or something else.  
I am curious is there anything I can ""bluff"" about on my resume to cover up this time period of gap in a better light than laid off? I typically say, I have been adjusting to life across the country and now have been open to searching for jobs again but even that feels week.  
I don't know how to interview better than I am given my cards. I know you can't connect with everyone but even with a perfect resume, how do I go about selling myself better and using the weaknesses in my resume or experience to some sort of advantage.",1713268586.0,
Broggie-Bucciarati,I wouldn't say yes if he asked ,2,1c5e7es,0,"I (ftm23) and my partner (M22) have known each other for 8 years now,had a FWB relationship for 6 months then made it officially the other half of the year. I've been living with him since the day we became official because of an eviction and the plan was to stay until I can get back on my feet and get my own place.

At the begining of our relationship,I was absolutely in love with him,the honeymoon phase was sickeningily sweet and I couldn't get enough of him ,but the more I stayed with him and our lifestyles mixed and never mixed well,the honey moon phase ended very quickly.

At the very begining when we became official ,I would talk about how one day I would love to have him forever in my life ,maybe married even ,he told me that he was not a fan of marriage and scared of long term commitment. I was upset ,very ,but I never forced him to change his views. I eased back from it but the relationship has been the worse rollercoaster of my life and I found my love for him falling downwards . 

I brought this up to him when I first noticed and told him I was falling out of love with him from how rocky it's been,he was upset and we came to an agreement to spend more time together to work on it. (I'm a extrovert,he's a gamer introvert) . 

Though it never really came back ,I like him enough to want to push this relationship but not love him that I know I won't finish the head with him,that was 3 months ago. Yesterday,he told me he'd like to grow old with me ,I laughed and said ""wow ,the guy that said he was scared of long term commitment?"" He said he wasn't scared of it anymore when it came to me.

In that moment ,I felt those words settle on my tongue , No. If he had asked me ,I swear I would have said no without thinking because both of our standpoints on basic things are too much and often results in him throwing a tantrum and me giving a silent treatment. I cannot see myself being with him beyond what we have anymore. A few months ago I would have jumped at the idea but now ,I despise the very concept of marrying him.",1713268480.0,

trazhboats,I am not sure what to feel,1,1c5j7dt,0,"I (F, 23) have been married to my husband (M, 21) for months now, we've only been a year in a relationship but we've decided, and got married this year. 

We are in a long distance relationship. He's not studying because he chooses to work, and he loves his work very much, he earns good money from it. I am currently studying and almost a graduating student in a university, although it's hard, I've been trying to find work but my schedule in school is bad and also, it is really hard to get a job from the country where I live in unless you've graduated. 

I used to live with my family, but they're really bad for my mental health, so my husband offered to get me a home and rent it until I graduate so I can move to his country. He's a good man, but here's my problem. I don't know how to explain it, but he's (I don't know if it's the right term) strict with money. I am not a materialistic person, I barely buy anything except for food which I need everyday. I am also good at saving money, but it's not like I don't have anything else to spend on since I am in the university. He gives me weekly allowance that is 70 usd per week, but I also have bills to pay. He knows when to pay the rent but somehow do not think that I also have bills, I sound really demanding and ungrateful but I don't really ask anything from him. I don't ask him to pay the bills, I'm paying it from my allowance that he gives me. Sometimes, I get short on money but it's hard to ask him for anything because I don't feel comfortable asking him for money as I know that he's paying a lot of stuff, tax, rent, etc., Although he spends a lot on things he wants and food he like. Which I am not against because it's his money, and I told him that I won't tell him what to do with it.

black_cat822,I despise my father,5,1c5ahv4,5,"I'm a 17(F) that received nail polish on my 17 th birthday. Until now, I was never allowed to wear nail polish. Today, I decided to paint them a bright pink/red. I wanted to see if I'd like it because I'd never worn that colour before. When my dad noticed them, he started laughing and joked 'who are trying to impress?' my parents joke like that now but I don't think it's funny. I think it's gross and annoying.

After an hour, I got back in the car with my dad to pick up another family member. Abruptly, he told me that I'm not allowed to wear that colour of nail polish and compared me to a hooker. He said that it isn't sophisticated and insinuated that I might as well wear what hookers wear. My dad isnt misogynistic but this comment definitely was. 

I knew he'd get mad but I didn't really care. How can a colour of nail polish determine a person's integrity or worth? He's worldly and intelligent, how could think this way? 

He does this every so often, where he'll take a small, virtually harmless thing and get emotional about it but only started doing that after he came out of the psych ward because of depression.
I'm really starting to hate him, because he's been doing this since I was 12. ",1713254020.0,

Unfortunately, things fell through as I failed a personality test. This sent me in a spiral of self doubt and questioning my worth. I eventually decided to go to therapy.

Impressive-Ad8764,I have a friend that gives unsollicited advice,1,1c5ijoy,0,"Hello!  
Here is my rant. So I have a friend that continously tries to persuade me she knows better and she also tries to make me follow her advice.  
It's about dietary changes. For me, it's important to eat from all food categories. And you know, we are  both in our early twenties, so this is the best approach at our age. And if you search online, any article would say that in our twenties we should look for calcium-rich foods and iron-rich foods especially, so that means, dairies, since calcium from dairy products are easily absorbed. And in these years we reach bone maturation, it's very important to be sure we give our bodies the calcium it needs. There are individual variations, of course, but this is the standard approach. I mean, it's not just internet, doctors told me the same thing (I study medecine).  
So her (she studies medecine as well), she is a firm advocate for dairy-free and gluten-free diets. I have acne, you know, and I treat it, I see a dermatologist and an endocrinologist, now I'm better. And what does she do? I didn't even ask for it, but she tries to make me give up totally on dairy products. The doctors I saw never told me that. But this girl keeps telling me that she read an unbelieveable amount of studies on that so she thinks she knows better. From any subject we would discuss, she turns back to ramble furiously about these diets in order to make me agree with her.  
Just imagine, she as a doctor, would go against any protocol, and would tell her patients the opposite of what we are taught to tell them. Yes, there are particularities for any patient, there are cases where dairies should surely be reduced, but to tell ALL the patients, that ALL their health problems will be gone by excluding foods from their diets, seems quite dangerous to me.  
I think she is influenced a lot by her mother, who gave up on dairies and gluten to improve her health, not for any illness in particular, she just did it. So I guess that she thinks  her mother knows the best and she goes on to preach it to everyone.  
I'm sick of it. She makes me so mad. She misinforms anyone she approaches, you know, in our discussions with our other friends that are not into medecine. She presents herself as a med student that reads scientific articles so, dairy and gluten are the devils on your plate, folks. I think she cherry-picks articles and doesn't consider them critically enough. And I try to tell my point of view, that diet is extremely nuanced, and that the standard advice is not at all what she says, but she has a big big mouth, she talks agressively and fast, so I can't say much. My God, it makes me so mad.",1713280352.0,
roundchocoball,its a weird feeling to have truly never been accepted ,6,1c57eg8,2,"I think about it so often.

 I am 21 years old and I cannot think of one instance where I had felt like my presence was truly wanted.

Some of my earliest memories include being outcasted by my cousins. The way we’d all gather at a cousins house and I would join everyone on our little adventures but I’d be one step behind.

I’ve learned to accept the feeling of not belonging at this point. I’m comfortable with my own company and I wouldn’t want it any other way but my heart truly aches for the little girl I was who just wanted someone to smile in her direction and be honestly happy that she was there.

I’ve done so much thinking. If there was something visibly wrong with me that everyone noticed and it made everyone uncomfortable with my presence.

I lay awake sometimes remembering the words of that boy in 6th grade, telling me to my face that he liked everyone in the class but me, he would make faces towards me and I never truly understood why. I had never gone out of my way to befriend him in the first place, but it would make anyone feel like shit if you were told that you suck and the others are better.

I strive to fall in love one day. I express how much I want to have friends and someone to call mine but I don’t put in the effort simply because it feels like I’ll just be a placeholder until someone better comes along, just like how I was the placeholder in the little group I had with my cousins that I was then kicked from.

It was my 7th birthday and I had just been gifted a barbie monkeybar playset. I was having such a great time until I didn’t want to open it yet and they spent the rest of the night ignoring me and talking amongst themselves in the corner of the room. I remember how pathetic I looked trying to talk to them.

Maybe I’m the type of loser person who just wants to be accepted… I know there are many people out there who would just tell me to suck it up and get over it at my big age… but I have never healed from what I endured in my childhood and I think a hello from someone I love could fix me.",1713242189.0,

Desirai,"My family is garbage, and has forced the burden onto my husband and me to take care of my grandma",1,1c5ic21,0,"Firstly my grandma herself is not a burden. It is the situation as a whole.

My husband and I have emptied our savings of $5000 in the last 2 years taking care of her because none of her children (my mom and uncles) will spare any money or time 

She lived alone now that my grandpa has passed but my brother (we share a mom) has moved in with her


The problem is he isn't reliable and doesn't work stable jobs because he has mental problems and addiction

The other family members have the attitude that if he lives there he should be taking care of her because he pays no rent. But he does buy groceries and contribute to the other bills 

But why exactly is it his sole responsibility to take care of her just because he lives there? If he is just sitting in his room and rotting while grandma starves, they still won't help.

My uncles are both wealthy and live in HOAs, drive new cars, take multiple vacations per year. They have a few dollars to spare.

And they live within 45 minutes of her home

My husband and I live 2 hours away

My mother is not reliable because she is also an addict. But she still lives less than 45 mins away

For 2 years every single weekend my husband and i take a trip to my grandmother's house to buy her groceries. We help pay her cable bill and utilities. We pay her cell phone every month (it's only $20 no big deal)

We buy cat food and dog food, I order her toiletries and general supplies (trash bags, soap, paper towels etc) off amazon every few weeks to have them delivered

We buy her insulin and test strips, along with other meds she might need. All of this has wiped us out. We have no more savings, we have less than $400 in our bank account at the end of the month and we have stopped entirely with buying any of this since January of 2024 because we are struggling so badly now

We have begged her to sell her house and move in but she wants to die in the house. We can't make her move.

In January my uncles said they would help her only if my brother moved out. So he moved in with us and lived for 2 months. However not one single time did either of them step foot in her house, take her to a Dr appt, or buy her some groceries.

In March my dog died. The dog had been living with my grandmother since grandpa died because she needed companionship. I asked my uncle M if he would contribute to the $300 cremation bill, he said ""You and [brother] and your mom need to step up."" I almost come unglued on him, how is us emptying our savings over the last 2 years NOT STEPPING UP??????

He said ""well I can spare $50""

He never paid it, we are making monthly payment to the vet.

We threw my brother out because he stole my bottle of pain pills and my car and drove back to our home town to sell them. I have not told anybody about this because of the absolute shit storm it will create. We took him back to her house and my uncles decided they will no longer contribute (not that they were)

What has set me off is my mom getting mad that she has been having to go back and forth taking my grandma to the grocery store. we do not have a good relationship because of her addiction. I imagine contributing financially to my grandma is cutting into her pill money.

She has no car, it was repoed because she can't make payments 

My mom called me mad that nobody is helping her take care of grandma

I didn't say anything but I wanted to tell her to piss off because my husband and I have been for years and now it's interfering with her life having to do it. Ask your fucking brothers for help then. 

We are financially fucked right now. We have no more money to spare, and we have a mortgage and a car payment and doctor bills. I am disabled and work part time along with my SSDI check, my income is barely $1100. My husband works 60+ hours a week to take care of my disabled ass and to pay our bills, he can't pay grandma's too.

I want her to come live with us and be done with it. That is THE BEST solution. But she won't. Absolutely refuses. Which kind of isn't fair and is a little selfish but I get her reasoning.

Particular_Pace_449,Regret reading through my post history,1,1c5i3u3,0,"I like to think I've improved but I'm still a pathetic loser that doesn't deserve the life I have. It's been 4 years since I graduated high school and don't have anything to show with what I've done since then. Deferred my uni course two years ago which means by now, I've unofficially dropped out. Tried to do a entry level metalwork course but dropped out since I'm dumb and struggled with learning as well as being sick so missed alot of classes. 

I'm an adult virgin who's depressed, has suicidal thoughts daily, socially awkward/anxious, paranoid, hate myself, unemployed, skinny, barely look after myself and still on my Ls (driver licence). All I got going for me now is that I go to the gym, that's it really. And even that is just a way to kill time as I don't eat enough to gain weight since I'm depressed and don't get out of bed until I feel hungry. 

I mainly just spend my days trying to distract myself, watching youtube, movies, shows, anime, reading, playing games. But eventually due to my depression, I lose interest and just sit there. Even jacking off doesn't feel that great anymore. Like damn, I brought a fleshlight as I wanted to feel the sensation of fucking something but it's sad to use now, especially the clean up process so it's just been in my cupboard, collecting dust. That and I cum within 5 minutes which is rough and I feel like it's a waste of effort, considering I live with a roommate and have to plan it when he's at work.

Anyway, I feel like I don't have much of a future. Based off how university went for me and dropping out of a entry level metalwork course and my overall bad attitude with learning and life in general. Right now, I just would like to get a part time job but I half ass the application process and always get rejected. I know I should make coverletters but can't be bothered. I need to ignore the burnout feeling from rejection and keep applying to the few jobs I'm applicable for. The reason why I'm wanting to get a part time job, isn't really for the money. But for how it would push me to look after myself more, be more social and ideally, I would slowly improve and regain some of that energy to do something with my life. As well as getting back into my hobbies that I haven't 'touched' in years due to depression like creative writing, drawing, making yt videos. Obviously, I know I could just get myself to do all that now, day by day. But it's hard to do for me, considering I don't want to wake up when I go to sleep every night and find it easier to just consume media than do something with my life.",1713279250.0,
Secret_Term1215,The closest friend I've ever had cant even look at me anymore.,1,1c5hpgy,2,"Hey all. I really cant talk about this to anyone without hurting her; so sit down this is a doozey. Needless to say I have not so great mental health, in high school I was in a pretty bad emotionally abusive relationship, I was pretty badly abused and pushed everyone I knew away and was in a pretty much severe depression and severe anxiety for around 6 years, I assumed one day I would sleep it off, and think normal but that never happened. Anyways I get to college and really dont put myself out there to meet anyone else. Come to my senior year and my grades are pretty good, but this is when I meet her, and I think shes gorgeous. I eventually work the effort to talk to her, and we become ok friends for about a week or so. During this time she would always message me and one time we stayed up until 2am in the university rec room just talking. This felt pretty damn good, for once it felt like somebody actually wanted to know about me, during this time she even looked up my house address and parents facebook(ok looking back thats weird), anyways a few days later she says shes going on a trip to visit her BF, I was devastated and cried, she says ""that must be a punch in the balls, you had me mindfucked there for a while though, being in a LDR your always looking for something new etc"" we've talked for quite a while and she never once mentioned a BF, even when I asked about her bio once(this is all on me however, I should of asked, I cried for other unhappy personal reasons aswell). It should of ended there.  
  
But it didnt the next day I ask if she was okay if we were still friends and she says yes, she apologizes for not telling me sooner. We become pretty great friends, eventually we tell each other about pretty personal secrets, I tell her my high school experience, I tell her things I have never told anyone else, she helps me explore some things about me like my sexuality and she reveals she also did not have the greatest high school experience and she has self harm scars, she later tells she SHs since she has a pattern of cheating in relationships; this only makes me feel more like a piece of shit and youll find out later. I genuinely for the first time in my life feel a purely platonic connection with someone. Shes in a LDR with this guy who I dont know(she later says she never brings him up because it makes me sad(should of ended then)), and we begin hanging out quite regularly, I do some things I shouldnt have done at this time, I noticed she vapes so I begin to buy her vapes, and start vaping and smoking, looking back this should not have happened, but I genuinely enjoyed seeing her happy. She used to always say with the vapes ""Now i have a reason to talk to you"", why? why would you need a reason to talk to your friend? It only made me buy them more. Things start getting bad and she even mentions at this point shes likely emotionally cheating with me, which only scares me; that any day any moment any time this person who I genuinely enjoy and is my best friend could realize this and have to cut all contact with me, my mental health becomes absolutely horrendous due to this and this was always a very scary fear I had throughout all this,  
  
I even tell her at one point it feels like im on a seesaw and im stuck and have to constantly battle catching feelings and keeping my only close friend. If i really cared about her it should of ended here, but it didnt, I should of stopped it. She begins to touch me, relativelly platonically(?)(Asking to bite me, biting me, rubbing my chest and carresing my arms) and sharing food, at first I sit there and dont touch back; I dont want to hurt her. Why would I hurt someone I care about? After a while I call her out on this and say like why are you touching me, I really cant touch back she says something along the lines of ""I think im using you as a replacement for the lack of attention in a LDR"", she later says she thought about it and I cant provide that for her, but this continues, what was I doing wrong? Eventually I convince myself its platonic and I touch back with the same things the arm on the shoulder, the shoulder rubbing etc. We would have smokes together every night which would usually be hidden in a stair enclave where we would hug each other etc. One of her responses during this time when I mentioned how bad it would look if somebody saw us doing this she said ""It would be worse for you""?? How would it be worse for someone who is not known to be in a relationship?? My self esteem was the lowest it has ever been in its life, I told myself that perhaps one day things would somehow magically change. Someone finally seemd to really like me?  
  
Eventually as you could imagine things escalate, this involves her sitting on my lap(forward facing, saying inapprioate things etc), her letting me rub her thighs and do her hair and rub her feet. I should of cut contact but she was the only person who know me, and understood me. I didnt want to hurt her, I didnt want to hurt myself, but I did both. The big event happens just before Christmas, we go out and we cuddle for a while in the backseat of my car, then we head back, while in the car prior she shows me lewds on her phone(I showed her a lewd of mine prior), then we go out to the pond and were looking in each others eyes holding each other and she asked to kiss my cheek, I say sure, she kisses my cheek and my chin just below my lips, then says ""You know it would still be platonic if I let you kiss me, then I wouldnt actually be kissing you"", I wanted to so very bad, I wanted to with my whole being, I lean in, lean out before eventually saying ""you have a boyfriend, If I kiss you your going to hurt yourself and I dont want to hurt you"", she says ""wow you have more morals than I do"", well I break the fuck down, she says ""I didnt want to kiss you, I love my boyfriend, even if I broke up I wouldnt want to ever date you, you have too much baggage"", ""if we kisses I would block you and stop talking to you"", the person who just asked me to kiss them, the person who has been biting me and touching me for weeks wouldnt even date me? This absolutely destroyed me. I didnt know what to think, anyways this ends with both of us crying, me almost puking and eventually with me consoling her.  
  
The next day we go get yogurt and I say shes my best friend and we simply need strong boundaries because I dont want to hurt her. If I should of stopped anytime it should of been now. I buy her a Christmas present and things end ok, breaks go by and im mentally gone, im at the lowest I've ever felt in my life, I feel insane, depressed, just psychotic. She messages and we talk everyday of the break(s), we say how much we miss each other etc, shes my buddy she really is, she knows everything about me, I know alot about her, and shes honestly my best friend, but this was hurting me. Anyways we return from the break into the new semester and I feel like im being used, I feel like a doormat, I feel like dirt. Things escalate here, I help her code, I loved watching her succeed, because shes my friend y'know? Anyways things get pretty bad, and we hang out alot, we always hug and I play with her hair and share our food and were pretty close, at one point I kiss her cheek for a week before realizing thats weird and stop it, there was a week where she would cuddle with me in my bed and I would move her hand from my chest saying stop, she would say how happy I make her and we would rub our faces together and rub our noses together, I would pretty much be repeating ""I dont want to hurt you"", but it made me feel good, how do I navigate this? She would say I was the highlight of her days, the highlight of her semester, how sad she was I graduate soon, how she wishes I was in her grade, how im not a chore to talk to or hangout with. I certainely didnt fully stop these physical actions now because I was selfish, because I was ignorant. She would rub my head as we drove and put her arm down my shirt and while I was driving, etc. She would often also say ""Why havnt you killed me yet...you must hate me etc."" but why would I? Things get super bad here, we head out and I buy her a vape and we have another tough conversation about things, with the usual, ""Im not breaking up with my boyfriend but your so lovable"",  
  
I really didnt want to hurt anybody. Anyways I get drunk, she lets me into her room and she sits on my lap again and non-platonic things occured. She cheated; I hurt her. I hurt her bad. I never wanted to hurt her. I never wanted to hurt anybody. The guilt is beyond anything I ever experienced and I cant even understand how she feels. She downplays it, I almost hurt myself bad because of the shame I felt that night, the next day im crying to her and tell her she should probably tell her BF if she really loves him, she says ""ok i will, he will still love me tho"" ""doesnt this scare you? I fuck around"" ""this guy called me cute the other day"" ""you deserve better"" , I then tell her not to tell her BF, because im scared and didnt know what to think to do. I should of not stopped her and walked away then. We stay close friends for around 2 weeks after this event before she realized because of a outside voice that she had to tell her BF, she said her BF broke up with her and she needed space, me being a selfish asshole was unable to do that, I didnt want someone I cared about harming themselves because of me, I wanted to be there for her, I saw her outside and ran up to her, she ran away and she couldnt even look at me. The next day she said that was unacceptable, which it was, and even before that event she didnt see room for friendship since it wasnt ""real"", what does that mean? I still dont understand it, how was it never real? She blocked me, that was 2 months ago and she still avoids me, said she would call the police on me if I approach her again.  
  
I tried to apologize, I tried to make amends, I tried to give my closure, I tried to seek closure, All met with disgust, hatred and anger. She literally will sprint away from me full speed as I stand there. I never in my life had someone sprint away from me, I dont know whats wrong with me or why she would think I would hurt her, but I dont blame her. She said she was sorry for her decisions before this and I had little to be sorry for, but how do I have little to be sorry for if im being treated as im a abuser? I should hate her guts, she even said she led me on, she knew how bad that would hurt me, she dangled happiness infront of my face for months, she ruined my senior year, shes filled my brain with pain and resentment and betrayal, she caused me to become ostracized, to become an outcast, I honestly feel forever damaged. but for some reason I still have this deep care for her and I shouldnt, I still hope with all my being she passes and succeeds. I hope shes okay.  
  
Im not a victim, im not a saint, I didnt stop my actions, I played a role and Im forever sorry, I lost someone I cared about and someone who maybe at one point actually cared about me. Im sorry. I dont know how to view this. I just want someone to talk to and someone to understand me, I just want someone to tell me I wasnt blind, for someone to tell me this doesnt define me, for someone to say your going to be okay, because as of now im 2/2 for being hurt badly in a relationship(I dont even know what to call this), any advice I get online I always have to type in ""ex"" to get relevant results which only makes me more confused She couldnt even wish me happy birthday or give me the present she bought me, i spent it all alone. I graduate college in 10 days, I have a ok job lined up, I have a not so great home life, I dont know what to do with myself or how to live with myself after all this, why would I do this to myself, why do I struggle forming connections? why do I hurt people I care about?it felt real to me. Theres more to it perhaps, she used to always say "" i hope im doing him more good than harm etc"" but i dont know how leading someone on who has emotional trauma helps them, maybe we both should of left each other alone. I really did like talking to her, and liked hearing what she had to say, but ill likely never talk or see her ever again. I dont want to go down this road again. I dont want to hurt anybody. I have panic attacks when I go to her hallway or if she sees me I feel like i have to document everything I do, i feel like a weirdo loser. I constantly breakdown.

It doesn't help that my current life isn't great either. My job sucks big time, I'm getting fatter and balder and greyer and uglier with each passing week and every week feels exactly the same.

Tall_Resist_1349,Just found about a ping pong ball size lump in my GFs chest,2,1c5ct4n,0,"Throwaway account   


Her chest (and by her chest, I mean her breast) has been hurting for a while and we've always chalked it up to stress, fatigue, and her diagnosed PCOS. The pain is only on one side and it used to be on and off but recently the pain has been constant for the past one to two weeks. She just got it looked at today and we found out that there is a marble-sized lump on both breasts. Not only that apparently her milk glands are inflamed.   


So far she's been prescribed anti-inflammatory meds and anti-bacterial meds for the inflammation and has been advised for a breast ultrasound. 

I'm really freaking out right now while consoling my GF and I literally do not know what to do, just blankly staring at a wall until my GF gets back

Back pain, stomach pain, surgeries, I feel like I live at doctors offices. Every few months it’s a new diagnosis. A new problem. It’s always something. I’ve been on painkillers before for months and months and I’ve gotten hooked. Been clean for a few weeks now, and it’s damn near impossible to function. 

My mental health is in shambles. I know I sound like an edgy teenager when I say this, but it really seems like nobody gets it. They don’t get that it’s not the fact that I don’t want to be better, it truly feels like I can’t. I feel stuck, in pain, broken, helpless in this stupid rut. I can’t brush pain off anymore. It’s constant, it’s annoying. And all I get is “get over it, buck up”

Dazzling_Ant_6881,Guy friend invites me to his house with his family around,1,1c5h983,0,"We were chatting and I happened to tell him that I often go to his city now due to work and he excitedly invited me to come over to his house. He lives with his family and mentioned that he is close with his nephews and they play around.

I jokingly said I was jealous and I'd like to join them. He then repeated for me to visit his place so that we can play with his nephews. Is it me or does it sound too intimate?


I've been bothered ever since because he has invited me to his house thrice now. One was on his hometown and one on where he is currently staying. Both times I offered public places but it seems he wants me to visit his home. 

I've been to a guy friend's house before but not with the family around so I'm conscious of what his family will think. I'm not also sure why he didn't consider what they'd think as he is an introvert and hardly brings anyone home so naturally people might suspect.

I'm trying to make sense of a recent interaction with my ex and would appreciate some insights. We broke up about 5 months ago, quite unexpectedly for me (I was blindsided), after a 6-year relationship. He ended things, stating that he couldn't learn anything from me anymore, neither on an intellectual nor on a social level. About a week after the breakup, we met for brunch to sort out some things, and he mentioned that two of us very close mutual friends were getting married. Hearing this was quite painful for me, given the context of our own split, and I ended up crying in the restaurant (which I would normally not do, certainly not in a public space).  
  
Fast forward to recently, after no contact for months, we met again so he could return some of my belongings. During this meet-up, he brought up the same friends’ upcoming marriage as if it was new information, completely disregarding my previous reaction. It struck me as odd and a bit insensitive. Is it normal for someone to forget such a reaction, or could there be something else at play here?

Past_Disaster1171,My sex drive is gone but my life is better than ever.,3,1c5ag5g,1,"I am 20. All my life I’ve only known anxiety and depression. I’m in a constant state of fight or flight and simultaneously find it hard to have the energy or motivation to do anything with my life. That was my life for the past 20 years, but then it changed once I started taking antidepressants.

It was rough the first few weeks but after 6 months I can confidently say I’ve never felt better. For the first time in my life I can relax and enjoy my life. Enjoy the little things. Feel content and at peace with myself. I have the energy to spend time with friends and family, pursue my hobbies and keep up with my university workload. Life feels great and is no longer monotonous. I’m not so worried about everything to the point where I can’t enjoy myself anymore. I’m more sociable and do things out of my comfort zone. Point is, life has felt like a blessing recently.

There is a caveat though. My sex drive is for the most part gone. I didn’t have a high sex drive before this. I’d say it’s average for someone in my age group. But now I almost have an aversion to sex. I feel grossed out by people who are too sexual. I have no desire to hook up with anyone. I only want a meaningful connection with people.

This loss of sex drive might bother some people, but it doesn’t bother me at all. I don’t really care. My life is great and I’m enjoying it. There’s more to life than sex.",1713253818.0,

jeydo2,She broke up with me for the second time,1,1c5g4da,0,"My ex-girlfriend and I met at school and quickly became friends. A very close friendship eventually turned into a relationship, for which we both left our current partners as we hadn't been happy with them for years and saw in each other an opportunity to heal and finally be happy and in love again.

  
It couldn't have been more perfect. We grew closer than ever and even planned to move to a new city together. But from the moment we came back from the first apartment viewing, everything changed. While we were still in the car, she said that she felt she didn't love me as much as she once did.

  
We talked about it a lot and agreed that the phase of being deeply in love would naturally end at some point. But things never went back to the way they used to be. The next few months were plagued by the fact that I became more and more insecure. She couldn't even say that she loved me anymore and we decided to just tell each other that we cared instead. I was so willing to compromise that I would have put up with anything for her. But her affection grew less and less, despite her assurances that she wanted a life together with me and didn't want to lose me.  
My reaction was to shower her with even more love and give her everything I could muster. I wrote romantic texts almost weekly. I made gifts for her. I surprised her with things I knew she liked, like her favorite candy or books I knew she wanted to read. I paid almost the entire cost of the horse she was taking care of.  
Then summer came and we went sailing together. On the sea and in the wind lies my heart and somehow it happened that it all spilled over to her and under the stars in a harbor we confessed to each other that we had fallen in love all over again.

  
When we returned home after the trip, it was as if we had met again and our love burned brighter than ever. But her affection quickly faded again. And I began to feel her pulling away. And through my clinging, as I realized that she was slipping away from me, she only moved further away from me. And finally separated from me.  
I can remember a moment when I stood outside her house and called her, begging to get a hug from her because I was feeling so bad and she just said she didn't care how I was feeling and needed to care for herself.  
I've never felt as bad in my life as I did after the separation. I gave up my apartment and moved back in with my parents. I dropped out of university because I couldn't move anymore and everything except lying in bed was too much. I even looked for a tree in the woods near my parents' house to hang myself from and gave myself an ultimatum. My parents supported me as best they could and eventually got me to commit myself to a psychiatric ward where I spent a month and got back on track a bit.

  
Throughout this time, we had contact on and off, but it only left new cuts. I spent the next few weeks and months traveling to different cities in Europe and finding myself again. And just as I was about to put the pieces of my heart back together and realize that there was a life without her, she came back. I tried to fight it, but quickly realized that a big part of my heart still longed for her. We went sailing together and quickly got back together. It felt like everything was different. She did and said everything I had always dreamed of her doing.  
We went on vacation together and went sailing a lot more. But just like the first time, her love diminished once we were home and I became more and more insecure. She wrote less, stopped calling, stopped coming to our weekly dates on Discord, stopped asking if we wanted to meet up, and stopped having sex. She stopped talking about a future together. And when I asked her if she was happy that we were together, she just said that she was, but that she would survive if we weren't.

  
Then came a long-planned skiing vacation, which we both hoped would bring us closer together again. But the exact opposite was the case. During the week we were away, she didn't hug or kiss me once. We slept in the same bed, but I wasn't allowed to lie close to her and she got up in the morning without even giving me a glance.  
When we were back home, I called her a few days later in tears and begged her to get closer to me again, that we could work on our relationship together, that I could change and endure everything for her.  
She then drove to my place, we sat in her car and she broke up with me again. And said that she thought she had a disturbed relationship with love and that she thought, that i was the right person at the wrong time.  
And now I'm back in that hole I know all too well. I feel better than I did after our first break-up, but I still feel that my heart has been ripped out of my chest again.

  
I try to show her a lot of understanding. She still wants to come on our two sailing vacations we planned for this year. And I haven't stopped writing her texts about how much she means to me, not as a girfriend, but as a person.

But I realize that it's hard and it hurts. I can't imagine life without her, but it feels like it shouldn't be. I don’t really know what to do now. It feels like life has lost its purpose again. I can't stop thinking about things i clould've said in a different way and if it would've changed something. I hate myself for becoming so insecure and clingy right before she broke up with me.",1713274132.0,
Lolita202,Feel bad for almost accusing someone of theft at the supermarket ,0,1c5g0iy,0,"I was in the small local supermarket buying more than I went in to get. As it is with small locals you tend to pass everyone once, a comment about how you should've picked up the big trolley, little old lady asks you to reach the top shelf biscuits etc.

Admittedly in the baking section a man gave me the creeps, I couldn't quite tell what he was looking for so I couldn't tell if I was just in the way, then he grabs a few random items and walks off (overloaded as he didn't have a basket or trolley) 

At the tills he then appears behind me on the conveyor belt self serve (though basket self serve and the other conveyor belt self serve we're empty) so I felt weird he lined up behind me who had filled the entire section.

Then someone else uses the other conveyor belt and he maybe came to his senses and queued up behind them but they almost immediately gather their items and go to basket self serve.

After maybe a minute we both notice they had left their bank card on the belt, I then see him flip the card over to see the security numbers and he sees me looking. I say ""No"" he then says ""no no"" and points over to the basket self serve and takes it to the woman who I wouldn't have been able to identify as I wasn't paying attention. I say ""give it to the staff"" before realising the woman is not only still in the shop but he knows who's it is. He returns, I say sorry. No more words are exchanged.

throwratbqofy,A guy (50+) started following me (27) yesterday at work. I’m still shaken up and a little scared to go back. ,1,1c5foeh,0,"I work at a plant nursery. We sell plants, but it’s a bit different because we grow them all ourselves from seed. I love it, however it’s all outdoors and it’s an expansive space, so while there’s several of us working at a time, typically we are all alone working on our individual projects, and being outdoors, we are very exposed to the general public. Which typically isn’t a problem because we are located outside of the city, but every now and then people will still walk by.

Yesterday, I was working with our grasses, which are located in an area that’s closer to the road. 

I heard a deep, rough *”Hey!”* come from a ways down. I didn’t say anything. He said it again. I looked up and saw a man, I’m guessing in his mid-fifties, with no shirt on, and he was probably 6’ tall and definitely had some weight to him. He was in front of me but across the street, and he was glaring at me. I just stared at him. He asked me if I had a water, because I was working outside and *”It’s supposed to get hot later.”* I shook my head yes. He asked if I had a soda. I shook my head yes. 

He looked both ways and started crossing the street, so I calmly grabbed my things and started walking back towards our main office. He was like *”Hey, where are you going?”* 

I told him I was going back to the main office, because I had a meeting there with my boss in a few minutes (lie, though I was hoping she’d be in there). At this point he had crossed the street and was walking several feet behind me, following me to the office, and he started telling me some story about how he was walking because he gave his bike pedal (which was worth over $100) to his friend (for free) because he needed it and that’s what Jesus would do, and *”Wasn’t that such a kind thing for me to do?”*. I said nothing.

He then started asking me if a girl like me thought his belly was attractive. He’s been trying to get rid of it, but if I liked it, maybe he would keep it. I told him my husband wouldn’t like this conversation.

At this point we got to the office, and much to my dismay, there was no one there either. I went inside and shut the door. He came in behind me before I could lock it. There’s a side door in our office that leads to a shed, where we keep all of our gardening supplies. I went in there. I could hear him in the office going *”Where did you go? I’m still here.”* 

I got out my cell phone to call my husband, but he didn’t answer. I decided to just hide for a few and thought he would leave. He didn’t. Just continued to loudly ask where I went, and declare he was still there. I decided to take the back door in the shed, to go outside the back of the building, where of course he was, and he had this huge smile and was like *”I was looking for you!”*

At this point I started to feel *super* uncomfortable, so I got out my walkie and asked for back up to the nursery, and started walking down another path, and he kept trailing behind me. He asked if he was bothering me. I said yes. He told me that he *”is a regular here, and we’ll get to know each other.”*

Then he was like *”You know I applied to work here and they wouldn’t hire me. Why’d they hire you?”* among other weird comments, like *”I bet you like it here, huh? I would.”*

And thank gawd my boss showed up right at that moment, power walking towards us, and I heard her go “WHAT do you think you’re doing?” He couldn’t answer her. She turned him around and walked him out and down the street. 

She also told me later that he was not a regular, and she has never seen him before.

And we are all okay, no one was hurt or anything and it was resolved without a big conflict, but even waking up today, I feel slimey and a bit freaked because in hindsight, especially typing it out, it seems like his comments were escalating and if my boss hadn’t shown up, I don’t know what would’ve happened.

And I’m a little scared to go back, because now he knows I’m there. And that I’m usually alone. I’m going to keep carrying a walkie, but I think I’m going to pick up some pepper spray or something before I go back. ",1713272900.0,

ghostfadekilla,Facing a deep personal struggle right now and it's literally breaking my spirit.,8,1c537ij,8,"I'm not going to repeat my entire post history. It's all there if someone's got the inclination to look. I've always been genuine on Reddit because what's the point otherwise? Here goes (fucking sigh):

Recently had some awful shit happen to me by a person I trusted. I trust very few people that way because it's tough to really see the world through other's eyes. The betrayal was bad, what happened next was worse. I won't get into it either but it decimated my entire world and just wrecked my shit.

That was a few months ago. I went from feeling incredible peace to not feeling so peaceful anymore, or at least it's just kinda out of my reach. I got sent a screenshot of that someone not only posting my name, my address, a couple of lies to construct the story they've constructed then they added the work ""gun"" to it, intimating that they were afraid and needed someone to take a step toward what I can only imagine is violence.

Help me understand how a person that you gave everything just flips on you and literally attempts to incite violence against you? They already took just about everything from me, which is fine because stuff is overrated, but I don't react well to being threatened and it brings out a person in me that I buried years ago when I decided that I no longer wanted to exist in a space of anger, resentment, immediate reaction to potential threats in very real ways. I don't get it.

I guess what I'm asking is this - how does one go from cherishing you, appreciating you, literally taking everything you've got emotionally and just lights it all on fire? Is that something a sane person even does? I've got my own problems, demons, etc, but I do a mostly good job of keeping them in check and I've spent a lot of time on a personal journey over the last few years to FIND that peace in myself, and found it. Now it just kinda feels like it's crumbling a bit.

I'm good atm but I certainly feel that old me creeping in and it's pretty disappointing if I'm being honest. Disappointed in myself, disappointed in my inability to cope properly with the mountain of problems that have cropped up, pretty salty about the just under 10kusd this has cost me so far, and more than anything - SUPER salty that it's all predicated on a single person's lie. Are people just shitty to each other when they lack the ability to be not only honest with themselves, but also with someone who simply did their best to take care of them? What even IS that about?

I know it's just my own perspective that's causing these feelings but damn me if it isn't shaking my faith in the common decency of people which I find the most distressing because I like people, most of them anyway. The shit is wack and I'm finding it difficult to reconcile it with myself, I'd love some of you folk's perspective on what it takes and means to rediscover and reclaim the parts of you that get lost when your world blows up.

I appreciate the space and any time. Be good and be good to each other. - ghost

TigerBalmAddict,Ended a 20+ year friendship over abusive stemming from alcoholism,6,1c54g30,1,"So one of my closest friends from high school has been battling alcoholism for the past 4 years. Part of me feels somewhat relieved but overall I feel like shit having to do this. I'll refer to this friend as Doug.

The pandemic took a toll on us in different ways. I worked as an ER nurse in the NYC area so I did not feel comfortable meeting people for a while. Doug was working remote but he was pretty socially isolated, his friend circle from what I understand was shrinking. I never really approved of his friends since most of them were like drug pushers and drunks. Getting rid of that terrible influence I feel like helped in the short term since he got closer to his family.

Summer 2021 he starts feeling comfortable to hang out in person. I visit him at his place, he seems okay but I noticed he downed like 4 shots of tequilas and a couple of white claws in front of me. I asked him if he was okay but he insisted he was fine. We hung out a few times after that but it was always at his place because he always felt too anxious to go out, so I accommodated him. We're still talking normally and texting often. Just in the back of my mind that there is a pattern that's going to lead to alcohol abuse.

2022 a lot of my time is spent getting used to my new job and traveling back and fourth to see my long distance girlfriend. I get courage to propose during the summer and Doug is happy for me. Around this time though Doug gets laid off from his job and I notice the drinking gets worse. He admits to having 10+ drinks a day, refuses to get help thinking he has it under control. One time he texts me out of the blue saying ""Sorry man, I'm such a fuck up I don't think I'll be around for much longer"". I rush out of work to check on him, and he's just fucking sitting on his ass playing GTAIV. I stay with him for a bit.

 I try introducing him to other activities like brazilian jiu jitsu since I also did it and it was a good social activity. He kept flaking out on me and for a while I felt like it made me look bad. He came up with bullshit excuses like saying ""oh I had bed bugs"" or ""my foot hurts"". Bullshit it was bed bugs, you'd have warned me before I visited your house or when I left. His parents also didn't seem to know what he was talking about. He ends up having an alcohol withdrawal seizure and ending up in the hospital I work at. It was bad I was the receiving nurse that had to triage him. His withdrawals were so bad that he had to go to the ICU for an ativan drip. When he got out of the hospital I visited him at his house and he was looking at rehabs. I thought maybe this was his wakeup moment hitting rock bottom, I was stoked for him. He does eventually go to rehab...but signs himself out 3 days in. He tells himself ""I just need to detox, I'll be okay"". I hang out with him two or three times after the rehab discharge but I start noticing hanging out with him feels like a chore and I'm not having fun. I try sticking through because I wanted to support him. Little did I know that would be the last time I saw him in person. 

It's 2023 where things get shitty. I told him I wanted him to be a groomsman to my wedding but he never responded to the invite. I'm blessed enough to have close friends I was able to find another one to step up. He just ghosted me during this period. Two weeks letter after the wedding he pops up and says ""yeah I blocked you because I needed time alone"". He starts taking days/weeks to respond to texts. One day he goes ""go ahead and laugh at your burnout friend that is now working at an Amazon warehouse"". I was happy he was working again but I guess he was asking for pity points. The whole summer he never responds to any of my texts. I try one last time for my housewarming party but nothing. 

Two days before I leave for my honeymoon, he sends me a picture of all the prescriptions he's taking for his depression/alcohol dependency with the message ""Still a suicidal loser, enjoy your honeymoon though"". I got fed up and didn't want to reinforce that kind of manipulative behavior so I ignored it. The day I get back from the honeymoon, he sends me a picture of 8 empty white claws saying ""Thanks for nuttin!"". Still the same manipulative stuff so I ignore it. Christmas comes around and he sends more stuff claiming I was distant and non supportive over these past few years and that this would be his last Christmas. I try calling him and left a voicemail telling him he needs professional help but he needs to accept the help. I couldn't be the one to give it to him, but I'd be waiting for him when he's ready.

A month later he texts me again telling me he didn't even listen to my voicemail and I need to act before I lose more friends. Not sure what he meant by that. I had enough at that point and told him he should have listened to the message and I won't put up with his crap anymore. I block him on my phone.

Now it's March of this year, I got a new phone with new settings so I forgot the block list was not there anymore. He said some pretty hurtful things. Accusing me of being a fair weather friend, calling my wedding shitty, and our friendship was a waste of 20 years. I knew none of those statements were true but coming from someone so close to me it did sting for a bit. Some of the stuff sounds like jealousy for sure because he seemed to be obsessed with the fact I travel with my wife and have a car. But one weekend he just keeps blasting my phone with texts with increasing hostility and vitriol I had enough.

I unfortunately ended the friendship through a text. I was going to say it in person but his hostility made me concerned for my safety because I do know about his knife collection and god knows if he had a gun since he lived in a not so great area. That text was pretty long, my friends have told me it was very well written, harsh in tone but not resulting to insults. Because I did say in the end do not bother contacting me again, I had to follow through and block him through my phone and my carrier. I might post the last text I sent him later if I can find it, I had the draft somewhere.

My boyfriend and I went through a bad crisis and we were „forced“ (by bad circumstances) to keep distance for a month. Two days ago we finally met again and it felt strange, I still love him so much, it‘s so strong that it feels like it rips my heart into pieces. 
But as we talked we both saw that our feelings had changed…he said that they aren‘t as strong anymore and that it feels weirdly like a friendship. 
I told him that it‘s bc of the distance we had and that bc of that we couldn‘t talk to each other and had to lock our feelings aways. 
We said that we wanted to try and start our romance again and meet often and close the distance by being close to each other (mentally and physically).

Hi, I've never really actually wrote about this before and wanted to give it a try to see if it helps me in any way. Also, I'm sorry if it isn't written well because I am doing this on my phone.So, I'm currently 32F and I was abused by my then best friends father for about 6 years during our sleepover from 3rd grade to 8th grade and only stopped because my family happened to move. I suppressed a lot of it and had a bit of a dramatic confession to my parents by them finding me drunk and vomiting in the bathroom, me telling them and them choosing not to believe me because I was drinking. They ended up believing me later in adulthood when recollecting about how apparently they didn't have the best feeling about him to begin with. (Thanks mom and dad). Anyways that really influenced me to just suppress it and keep to myself until I basically spiraled in my early 20s when my more of my memories resurfaced. It basically didn't feel ""real"" until then. After years of self destructive behavior like drug abuse, I finally got help and recovered a lot. 
However, a couple years ago. I found out on my old friends Facebook that he passed from an illness and was surrounded with love from his family and friends. I've suppressed again on and off because honestly didn't really know how to feel about it. Part of me was of course glad he died a relatively young death because, well karma. Other part of me feels resentful that he was surrounded with love and family at his death because I don't feel he deserved it. They had no idea I'm sure what he was capable of and what he did because I saw no point in coming forward so many years after it happened when my own parents didn't care and with no evidence, who would believe me? It was also too late in my early 20s to try anyway because of how long it had been. I also would have felt guilty doing that to his daughter, my old friend. My own father passed as well before he did and despite what happened, I love him and couldn't imagine what it would be like to hear someone accuse him of such horrific behavior. My father also apologized on his death bed too for it. My mom is still in denial however that it would have mattered if she acted differently. I also regretful for not trying harder to get help or try to stop it or hold him accountable. Like I said, it just didn't feel very real back probably due to disassociation. I'm not sure what to get out of this but thank you for reading. Any thoughts and opinions are welcome.

idkwthimdoing87,In love with my married best friend,3,1c589m5,2,"I (37F) and in love with my (37F) best friend, and have been since I first laid eyes on a picture of her. We met at work and became really close/great friends within a few months of us talking. We text every single day, all day, and it all had been insane for me. I treat her just as well as I treat my close friends, but slightly better because I am in love with her (don't worry, my friends all get royal treatment, so that's my bare minimum all around). There would be innocent flirting, which her husband knew about (she's straight) and she'd joke if her and her husband didn't work that she was going to convince me to marry her, lol. We'd also all hang out (me, her, her husband), and I love her family (kids). Let me back up some and say I've never had romantic feelings for a woman, though I have had sexual encounters with them and have considered myself bi-sexual for a good part of the last 6-8 years. Fast forward to 9 months ago. We're texting and she tells me some things that don't make sense. So I ask for clarification and she says she'll give me hints but won't come right out and say it. I couldn't guess it so I concede and come to terms with not cracking the messages. She gives in and tells me she loves me as more than a friend and she doesn't want to lose me as a friend and she understands if I don't want to come around her because I'd feel uncomfortable due to her confession. Now, I can't even begin to put into words how I felt inside after holding in me feeling the same for over a year. I told her I'd felt the same for a while, but I was never going to breach the topic due to her relationship. Not really sure what I'm hoping to get out of this, as I'm super new here, but 3.5 years in- and her being the first woman I've ever considered dating- has made me compare every person I've attempted to date recently to her. I love her so much that I just want her to be happy, even if it's not with me, though I'm secretly hoping that somewhere in the future she does pick me as she's told me she's never felt anyone she's ever been with has truly loved her for her before me, and has actually showed it. I could go on and on about her and our whirlwind of a friendship in these last 3.5 years. Thanks for taking the time to read, if you do. 🩷",1713245276.0,

Yet_Another_Red_Pill,My father has been red pilled and it's ruining my family,2,1c59q07,0,"Throwaway, just venting I guess...

My father has never been a great man. He never had a great family growing up (father left when he was young and abused his mother. His mother saw too much of his dad in him and neglected him. ) He claimed he always wanted a family of his own, but was never a good husband or father. 

He wanted a son, but had two daughters. He never tried to relatee to us or really spend time with us. When we were little he was a shift worker, but then ended when I was 7. He lost his job, smoked alot (pot is illegal here) and smoked cigarettes. He wasn't involved with us kids or my mother, I never looked at them and thought ""thats what love looks like"". 

After losing his job he became depressed, my mother didn't everything to try and help him but nothing got through. I empathise alot because it's something I've struggles with my whole life as well, but he stopped trying, stopped living. He stayed in his room and played video games and smoked, that's all really. My mother had to do everything, she did shift work, got us up for school, cooked before she went to work, cleaned the house and payed for everything. Even when he got a job he didn't contribute to the household. 

Their relationship has always been rocky, for as long as I can remember really. I can remember telling her to find a divorce lawyer when I was young, but she loved him and we were poor. He got worse. He was scary and loud, always yelling at the drop of a hat. He became violent towards me and my sister one day, almost broke down my door. I thought she'd leave him but didn't. I don't think I'll ever forgive her for that. 

I moved away and stayed gone for 5 years. I only came back because I had no choice. After covid and the recession there was a rental crisis. My partner and I couldn't afford to live and it was come home or be homeless. Since being back I noticed he was watching male podcasts. How women should respect men, how men were the providers and women should be submissive and subservient. Sex has always been an issue. I remember being young and him telling me ""if you don't give a man what he wants, he'll get it somewhere else"" saying how it's not cheating because it's ""a wife's duty to provide sex"". It really fucked me up. 

The podcasts have made everything worse. Even though he's not a provider by any traditional measurement he still believes he's entitled to all the ""benefits"" of ""being a man"". He believes the downfall of society is a woman's education and that it's a woman's job to produce children. He's also now on the bandwagon of ""it's only natural for men to desire younger women"" in relation to a man in his 50s or 50s dating an 18 year old (he has always been violently against such things until the podcasts) as well as ""it's only natural for men to have multiple partners and spread their seed, but women shouldn't sleep around as it makes them undesirable *like a car with a high podometer*"". It's honestly sickening. 

Him and my mother are now separated after a horrible series of events that involved both me and my sister (a bad argument nothing physical) he said I deserved to be hit, that women are all the same, that we're evil and my partner should ""watch out because he'll be next"". We're stuck living together because of the housing market, no one can afford to leave and my parents are to old to by houses themselves... so we're all stuck. 

Everything will be *tolerable* and civil and then he'll drop a bomb and start everything all over again. One second he's saying ""he understands his marriage is over and is okay with it"" to blowing up insisting everything is my mother fault, saying no one can be mad at him for his actions and behaviour the past *decade* because of the depression and insisting that he did nothing wrong. 

Today after everything has been civil and normal he sent her a request to watch a podcast called *Happy Wife School* which tells you how to be a good wife and keep a happy husband. I almost lost my damn mind. They're separated and he wanted her to change her last name and then he sends *this*! 

I can't live like this anymore, walking on eggshells, waiting for another blow up, worrying about losing the roof over my head or worse. But I don't have any options.

I’d even settle for my abusive ex who just broke up with me. Just to feel something. To be held and told it’s okay…

The next day she doesn’t talk to me at all and i am weirded out but ignore it and later my youngest brother (8) comes to my room, i live in the studio separate from the house, he comes up to me sobbing because our sister had whipped him with a towel several times because he left it on the floor.

I let him in and foolishly forgot to lock the door behind him, 2 minutes later she comes storming into my room screaming at my brother and when i tried to defend him she started screaming at me because of the charger and going into her room. I called her a hypocrite and told her she should have talked to me like an adult. At this point im done with her i have endured 13 years of her abuse and my little brother is crying next to me. I scream at her to get out and after arguing for longer she leaves. During the argument i got out my phone to record her screaming and she said “Yeah call mum, run to someone else instead of dealing with your own problems”

later i went to get my stuff after she moved it (once again being hypocritical) and she started another argument with me. at this point i had told our mum what happened and all she said was “i dont want to choose sides” which broke my heart but this argument happened in the house and everyone heard me scream at her, i told her i was sick of her treating me like shit and abusing me. i told her she has apologized so much to me it doesnt mean anything anymore and that if she wanted to change she would. she started crying like i was the one hurting her and i called her out for trying to use that to mentally manipulate me into feeling sorry for her like she always does and she called me a terrible person for saying that. I told her she was an adult and so was her boyfriend and that they should leave then she flipped it on me saying that she loves everyone and doesnt want to leave and i should leave if i dont want to be around her.

I dont have a job and i do have a great friends who have offered me their ears to listen and places to stay but i feel like a burden not being able to contribute. I stayed at my friends for a few days because even seeing her made me so emotional it led to me cutting myself

I haven’t talked to her since i got home, i avoid being around her. But she keeps moving all her stuff into the loungeroom where i used to hang out and bringing all her boyfriends stuff there too as a big ‘fuck you im staying right here’

what’s worse is that i have really bad memory from a lot of trauma but i keep having these dreams and flashbacks to when we were kids and she would touch me and say awful gross things... 

And to clarify she has been physically, mentally and verbally (maybe sexually) abusing me since i was 4. I have been taken to the doctors after being beaten up by her more than once.

I don’t know what to do, seeing her act like nothings wrong telling everyone im the problem, i dont want to live with her anymore, i hate her, i think if i stay here ill hurt myself i dont feel like i have much left in me to keep myself alive.

lucygoosey7,My dad is a monster,1,1c5comq,4,"I just found out about a week ago that I was getting sexually abused by my Dad as a child. I was around 8 when he un consensually stuck something up my coochie. I remember screaming and my mum getting mad at him but it was never reported, if anything I was silenced. I couldn't even call up kids helpline without getting threats from mum. We had this thing called 'our little secret' where he would do the thing and say 'don't tell mum, you'll get in trouble'. It didn't stop there though, he'd make up punishments if I didn't do things the way he wanted. One time I wasn't allowed to eat before doing my exercises even though I was starving which triggered an eating disorder. I've only really told a few people about what happened and not all of them believe me since he's such a likeable person and he seems like he wouldnt do any harm.

At some point when I was in class, I got so horny that I started doing it through my pocket. I wasn't looking at anyone or anything I was literally just staring in dead space. I did it multiple times. After a while, some people started spreading it around and word got to me. That's when I realized that was I was doing was fucked up and I made people uncomfortable. For some fucking reason i thought no one would notice or mind. This is still something that keeps me up at night and is haunting me.

The worse part is, only after that did they give us sex Ed. I had to watch it with the people I literally made uncomfortable and I was so scared of being confronted about it. I started having suicidal thoughts since then.

If I have an issue I'd like to bring up he'll just start crying. I'm just getting frustrated because I feel guilty for making him cry. It really affects our communication..

We had a rough patch for the past year due to his habits, health, hygiene etc. We had a conversation which resulted in him once again, crying and promising to change. 

I brought the issue back up because I'm still not seeing a change. I couldn't even get to finish what I had to say on my mind.. he just started crying and talking about not wanting to lose me. I don't like to seeing anyone cry so it just ended with me comforting him.

I feel like I'm being manipulated as I'm just giving him chances and chances over again with no promises being fulfilled.. I'm honestly starting to think if he's trying to guilt trip me..

He's a sensitive person, but not normally to that extent during movies, funerals, family etc.
I can understand if he's sensitive but he needs to learn how to hold composure...

nights82,Met my partners parents.. ,0,1c5bwkb,1,"So after about 1.5 years of us dating I finally got to meet my bfs parents. He did warn me about them since theyre a different culture than mine which was totally fine. I really dont mind adapting to their habits since I am a guest at their home. I was really excited and nervous and brought them a box of the expensive fruit that they like as a gift. They were pretty friendly & I talked to both of them a good amount. I thought we were having a good time and after dinner we went into my bfs bedroom to change for bed. His dad asked him to fill out some paperwork so he left and ended up being gone for a longer time than expected. 

He came back and had a kinda angry/sad look on his face so I asked him whats wrong. He said nothing its just some tax stuff. I didnt really believe him but I didnt want to press him since he was tired already. A few min later he just looked really sad and said they dont like how big you are. I kinda just quietly said ok bc I mentally prepared myself for that but honestly it still hurt. I cried and he said he was really sorry and that he loves me.

I am plus sized I know and Ive been this way all my life. In the past years before I met him I lost a decent amount of weight/gained muscle and while I was never skinny I was at a comfortable weight and my drs said I was very healthy. During that time I had to unlearn a lot of self-hatred, an eating disorder and taught myself more positive ways to help my relationship with food and self. Unfortunately pretty shortly after we started dating I had 2 surgeries in 1 year (1 genetic issue & 1 spinal injury). During this time I was on so many medications and very limited in my mobility so I gained a lot of weight back + bloated. Now Im in PT and doing so much better, moving better, able to cook the way I want. However working all that weight off is gonna take a while and again Ive accepted that Ill never be super thin or skinny the way his family is. 

I eat healthy, I try to be as active as possible. My bf isnt thin like them either but hes pretty buff with a lil belly and eats wayyyyyy more than I do. They dont know what Ive been through and how much it affected me. I know I cant please everyone but despite trying to be the best I can be the only thing they said was that they dont like how big I am.

In the long run all I care about is how he loves me and honestly hes the most supportive person Ive ever met. Hes literally supported me at my worst and never made me feel like a burden. Literally tmi wiped my ass and helped me take showers post op. He still likes to put my socks and shoes on even though I can do it now.

I only realised when he finished on top of me. 

He never even asked me before he finished on me. Idk why but I feel shit about this. Idk why I even hooked up with him, not like we had great dates. On top of that, it was the first time I'd had sex after my ex broke up with me about 8 months ago. I feel so shitty about this.

was hard going through the comments and coming to terms with the fact that - I was sexually assaulted? Rape/civil offence, it's still hard to digest this.

I visited a gynaecologist and got tests done. Took a contraceptive pill too. 

Never spoke to him again, don't plan on. Not going to take any legal action for my peace and sanity (it may be selfish but this is what I need to do). Will be a lot more cautious and firm in the future. Lesson learnt.

vi891,I feel like I'm sexually broken,11,1c4wtxe,1,"TW: SA

I was with this guy for a few years who basically didn't understand the word no. Eventually I got used to it and just figured I should get it over with without much protesting everytime he asked. I began to feel so worthless after. He liked to get me drunk to the point I was nearly out of it. He had threatened me sexually, and he sa'd me while he thought I was asleep prior to us even being together. He was my first experience with everything and my only experience for a long time.

I learned and accepted that what happened was messed up but I didn't really think it had an effect on me. I have started sleeping with someone else however and for the most part it was going fine. He had been really nice to me and every time he cuddles me after, which honestly really shocked me at first. I didn't know that was typical and I couldn't understand why he even wanted anything to do with me after he was done. It was nice to experience after I got used to it though

But the other night he came over he drank a lot, he was upset with me and after he woke up he started touching me trying to initiate something. I kept moving his hands away not wanting to do anything but he just kept putting them back. Eventually I just started crying. I don't think he noticed, but in that moment I just felt horrible. The fucked up thing tho was that there was a part of me that wanted him to continue despite my attempts to get him to stop. I'm not exactly sure why. Maybe to confirm some idea in my mind that I deserve this? Idk. Eventually I just gave up again.

dengthatscrazy,My baby choked and stopped breathing last night and I still feel like I can’t breathe.,15,1c4szxz,8,"I went grocery shopping yesterday and my husband stayed home with our 10 month old. She’s been pulling the sides of her diapers and sometimes little fluffy pieces come off, so I usually keep her fully dressed. She had a blowout and my husband didn’t get her dressed after, because it was warm and he still likes getting skin to skin when he can. They’re like peas in a pod, he’s crazy about our baby girl and she’s a big daddy’s girl. She was sitting in the living room watching her favorite show and playing with her toys, and he was at his desk (also in the living room) playing his game. He ALWAYS keeps one side of his headset off his ear and he’s incredibly attentive to her when it’s just them, and even if I’m home, if I’m busy cooking or anything, he’s on top of it. so I know he didn’t ignore her or neglect to pay attention. 

She managed to tear off a really big strip of the side of her diaper, the part that wraps around and sticks to the front, and I’m guessing was just chewing on it because she’s teething right now. She swallowed it at some point obviously. He said she crawled over to him and wasn’t crying, but he picked her up and let her sit in his lap while he played like he’s always done. He thought she was just tired because it was about 6:30 and she hadn’t napped since before noon, so when he saw her falling asleep he tried to gently shake her awake and instantly realized something was wrong. He said within less than a minute she stopped breathing and started turning blueish, so he flipped her over and started patting her back hard while he called 911. Mind you, the fire station is right across the street from our home. He did chest compressions and got her conscious again, and they showed up and did some things and checked her vitals. She threw up once and still had labored breathing, and that’s when I got home. He hadn’t called me because he didn’t want me panicking while I was driving, and he knew I was almost home. I can’t even begin to explain how I felt when I saw it was him and her outside with the emergency services when I pulled up. As soon as I took her from him she threw up again and we found the strip from her diaper in it. She was fine after that and after a short nap and a bath she was back to her normal happy little self. 

But I still feel horrified. She slept in our bed with us last night because both of us couldn’t stand the thought of her being in her own room after that, and so it was the only way we could sleep. I know she’s okay. But all I can think about is how I only hugged her and didn’t kiss her before I left because I didn’t wanna get chapstick on her face. Or how if something more than that had happened and I hadn’t been here, I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself. I’m a sahm, and I’ve always been very very careful. But what if I had run to go to the bathroom real quick and she hadn’t been able to crawl to me in time? Or if I had gone to wash my face and she couldn’t? Or if I was cleaning in another part of the house. If it had been on my watch would I have been as calm and immediately responsive as my husband had or would’ve I have had a moment of panic before I did anything that ultimately saved her life? Every parent knows these things can happen and you do the best you can to prevent it. But having it ACTUALLY happen is heart wrenching. My baby stopped breathing. She somehow made it to her daddy because she knew something was wrong, and by the grace of God she’s okay. But I can’t stop feeling like I’m gonna explode. I know so many worse things could’ve happened, and closer calls could’ve happened. I’ve always been so careful and attentive. Even to the point that my MiL says I worry too much and I’m gonna spoil her. But now I feel like a horrible mother, because in reality we got lucky that she was mobile and that my husband was right there. I have a million things to do each day and can’t spend every second in the same room. I’m with her 90% of the day or more, even when my husband isn’t working.

She’s napping right now and I’m having to consciously fight the urge to go make sure she’s breathing every five minutes.

1337rattata,I feel so hopeless right now and honestly like I've lost my faith in people.,4,1c55d5s,1,"My (35F) mom had a stroke last January and went from living independently with no issues to completely competent, but entirely nonverbal. I had not had the best relationship with her, but we had gotten along a bit better after I moved 4 hours away for college, and were fairly close at the time of the stroke despite the fact she was never very maternal. My half sister (42F) is similarly difficult to get along with, has never gotten along with our mom, and would regularly go 1+ year without talking to her at all. I'm also not particularly close to my sister, we would only ever text maybe once a year or so, though we were always polite with one another.

  
After the stroke, my sister had very little to do with any of the situation. I dealt with applying for Medicaid, taking my mom to necessary appointments, getting her in a nursing home, dealing with legal issues, emptying her house, selling her house, and I've kept her dog. Last July, I moved my mom into a nursing home five minutes away from me and I see her 4x a week. I buy her snacks and restaurant food and I cover all of her bills that her Medicaid doesn't cover. I've been panicking because it's extremely important to her that she stay in a private room. She has always been a solitary person and many of the residents have dementia and don't remember who their roommates are. It would be incredibly stressful for her to have to stay in close quarters with someone who was constantly asking who she was when she's not even able to reply. I don't think she would ever adjust to that and I would not want that for my worst enemy. The private room is not covered by Medicaid and costs an additional $900 a month that she doesn't have. I asked my sister if she was willing to pay any of it (she is an attorney making six figures with no kids and a live-in boyfriend who also makes six figures) and she said no, that there was no reason for her to need a private room. I intended to find some way to cover the cost even if it meant I had to take on a third job.

  
In September, my dad passed away unexpectedly in an accident. He is my biological dad and my sister's adopted dad. They did not get along well at all and she had not spoken to him in about 10 years. He repeatedly mentioned to me about how his lack of relationship with her was his biggest regret in life, and he was sad that she would not ever respond to his attempts to reach out. My dad and I were very close and he was one of my best friends. I would not have made it through everything with my mom if I had not had his support and advice. Unfortunately, he did not have a will set up. For the past six months, I have been trying to get my sister to sign a single document that I needed that would allow me to be executor of my dad's estate. Since she hasn't sent this over to me, I have been having to pay his mortgage, utilities, and property taxes out of my money. I work two jobs and had to go part-time at one because all of the stress from the last year was eating me alive. I live alone with a bunch of pets and while I'm not living paycheck to paycheck, I don't have enough expendable income to fully cover my mom's costs indefinitely, either.

  
I am aware that because my sister is adopted, in the eyes of the law, she is just as much his child as I am, and I was really naive to think that because I was the one handling his cremation, arranging his funeral, talking to his friends, writing his obituary, and dealing with all the financial/legal stuff that she would not make this about money. She hadn't seen him in several years and didn't even come to the funeral. Today, when I asked her again for the paper that she was supposed to mail to me months ago that would let me begin the probate process, she asked what I was planning on doing with his house. I said that I was going to rent it out because his mortgage is low and I can probably make enough to cover our mom's expenses from the rental income. She then dropped the bombshell on me that she was expecting 50% of the rental income... even though she knew it's not like I'm trying to keep this money to get rich, I'm literally using all of it for our mother.

  
I don't really have any legal recourse because she is his daughter, and so I know I'm just going to have to go through with it and look for another job to cover the difference. But I feel so incredibly hurt and betrayed. I can't stop thinking about how my dad wanted a relationship with her so badly and she had absolutely nothing to do with him until now, when he is gone, and all she cares about is getting $500 a month, which is a small fraction of her income and absolutely everything to my mom's care. I have been trying so so hard to hold it together and not burst into tears when I visit my mom because I don't want her to feel like a burden, but I haven't been able to stop crying all day long. I am the only person that sees her with any regularity (her sister lives three hours away and visits once a month, and my mom didn't have any friends). My sister only lives about an hour away but has only seen her twice since the stroke and doesn't even text me to ask how she's doing.

  
I'm sorry, I know a Reddit post is not really the appropriate place for any of this, but I lost my health insurance when I went part-time, so I can't go to therapy. I have very few friends and I feel like I've been burdening them over the last year with all of my problems and my depression, so I'm trying not to let on how upset I am right now. I feel so incredibly hopeless and like I have nowhere to turn. If you read all of this, thank you very much and I hope you have a wonderful day.",1713235713.0,
jsjred,I hate the way I look now,1,1c5b4zq,0,"TW: body image, ed, pcos, etc

I (32F) would say that I genuinely hate the way that I look. For a little back story, growing up in middle school, I was always the girl with the mustache and just weird awkward pre-teen things I didn’t know how to handle that made me not as cute as all the other girls my age. Almost as soon as I got to HS this changed, and this was the start of active social media (myspace also yes, still in middle school yikes) and I was suddenly getting a lot of attention from guys online. So much so, I’d be in random blogs and every person called me jailbait (early 2000s were weird) it was a crazy change for me and I immediately just craved more attention. As the years went on I had finally found a style for myself that I liked and finally was able to accept that I was actually pretty and I felt good about my appearance. Or I thought I did… I would absolutely say I peaked (or started to peak) in high school which is so fucking unfortunate because I hated high school. I was getting more attention online and people in school saw that and always gave me shit for it. I was just more social online than irl and it was slightly noticeable. I still had a lot of friends but most were surface aside from the people I’d been friends with my whole life. Anyways… as soon as I graduated everyone left and moved. I mean everyone I knew. My bf cheated on me while away, my best friends had new friends, I was no longer active online and I was diagnosed with major depression and i was fully anorexic. The anorexia  was mostly due to the depression of the big life switch, but it also made me feel I had control over something, my self image. I was happy with how I looked during this time and I hate that. Finally my mental started to get better, positive relationships with people, positive life changes, brand new friends irl and things were looking up again. Well at this same time, I started to gain weight, and got off birth control. Turns out, I gained 100+ lbs, and it’s because I developed PCOS from taking the pill. Fast forward to now, seeing old pictures of myself absolutely destroys me. I don’t like to reminisce because I look nothing like my older self. Not in a “awh she grew up you can still see the same little Tara” no, like a “holy shit that’s actually you?” kind of way. It fucking sucks. I am literally almost 250 (going from 95 at my lowest and my body “normal” of 135) I grow a full on beard, I’m talking I have to shave sometimes twice daily, that is not an exaggeration, and it is full and black and thick, like a literal man. I am aging, my posture is god awful, I have excessive amounts of body hair, I have a crazy double chin, yes because I’m fat but it’s also genetics, my blonde is already going completely gray and falling out in clumps, the list goes on.

I just don’t know what to do. How will I ever love myself again, how will I ever be attractive again. I just wish I never knew my potential and then I wouldn’t feel this way. I just wish I could show you the stark difference, it haunts me. 

I’ve tried everything. All sorts of diets, sleep changes, supplements, prescriptions from Dr’s and nothing helps. Tried laser hair removal on my face and body, made it worse, beard is fuller. Tried changing my style, tried different active hobbies (in Utah tried every outdoor hobby you can imagine), literally everything I can think of to feel better. I have always struggled with depression since about 18 (hence ed) and it’s been off and on. I have ADHD also but it’s so hard for me to get it treated. They won’t see me for meds for months and I don’t even know if I want to take ADHD meds. Regardless I have also tried therapy, anti depressants etc as I know some of this is mental. I know this post seems stupid but I am tired of hating myself, and feeling bad for myself, and trying to do something over and over again about it and just continuously ending up back at square one. I feel at a loss. My friends are BEAUTIFUL (yes to me but also by society’s standards) and it’s like a knife to the gut. I feel I can’t celebrate them, and I absolutely cannot accept a single compliment from anyone. It’s pity and also unintentionally backhanded (although always the purest of intentions)

I don’t have a purpose for posting this, I have never posted before, I just hate that I hate myself and don’t know what to do about it. I feel unlovable every single day, and feeling that way since 19/20 when I am now 32 is just really starting to hit pretty hard. ",1713256746.0,

MinervaMinkk,I want to be the person people think I am.,4,1c51g6b,0,"I've tried to kill myself by 3x now. I have therapy 3x a week to see multiple mental health professionals. In the past it's been court ordered. Cumulatively, I've spent years in psychiatric wards, rehabs, and hospitals. Tomorrow I have cleaners that specialize in hoarding and mental illness because I can't seem to keep a basic standard of living. I've been kicked out of PhD programs and lived in my car just so I can have access to local gig job in random locations. 

But people see me as, idk, something. I vividly remember my undergrad professor saying that I was destined for success. It's random but I remember that whenever someone else gets the same impression. And it happens pretty often to be honest. Not a lot, but far too much for the kind of person I am.

I get invitations to be a panelist for women in tech & seminas for how to make 6 figures under 30. I don't even make 6 figures after taxes. I get in Ubers and 40% of the time, they recognize the destination and ask how I got there.  They want thier kids to spend days in places like this. They say it feels good to drop people like me off in places like this, it gives them hope that their kids can do the same.  

I am black. I'm only 28. I make work in tech and finance. I get good marks and performance stellar performing awards for reasons I don't even know. I understand that isn't common but still...I'm just good at playing the part and saying the right things at the right time 

I design curriculums too. I used to be a teacher. My students think they should be pleasing me instead of the other way around. When my finance students fail their certifications and exams, I see how scared they are to see me. I've failed way more exams than they have..and that's with police intervention. 

When it comes to my students, I can usually tell when it's best to be the person they think I am and when to tell them that I've been where they were if not worse.

But each Uber ride, each student, each award, speech, panel whatever.... I'm pretending to be whatever it is they think I am. Like I'm some person to look up too. Then I go to group therapy and hear how easy it is for everyone else to quit abusing drugs and alcohol. Then I go to 1 on 1 and listen to my therapist tell me that I'm not making progress and that they're referring me to someone else because whatever's wrong with me is so bad that I need a specialist. I walk out of my house pretending not too see the dozens of piles that have mold somewhere. My fiance said I deserved ""better"" when he broke up with me.

And I just wish I was exactly the kind of person that I looked like. I'm see why people get that impression but I can't love up to it. You can't even call it functional depression. It stopped being functional after the first suicide attempt.  I'm just lucky and very good at performing. 

I wish I didn't have to pretend though. I don't even want to be successful. I just want to eat & shower every day and not have therapy practically be a part time job

throwaway1000cookies,I thought about killing my girlfriend because she abused me,4,1c54xmc,2,"**CW: domestic abuse, homicidal thoughts (it might get graphic)**

**Sorry if bad formatting and bad English, I'm on mobile and English is my second language.**


When I(25M) was together (for 4 years) with my ex(24F), she was extremely controlling and abused me in many ways. She manipulated me into thinking everything was my fault. She made me do all the cooking, cleaning and washing of clothes while refusing to get a job. I also paid for most of her things, her mother gave her money for the rest. A master of gaslighting.

She screamed at me, threw things, broke furniture, and had multiple breakdowns whenever she didn't get what she wanted. I comforted her every time, and she convinced me it was my job as a boyfriend to support her. Except for the first year of our relationship, I never heard a single thank you for everything I did, nor an apology for her behaviour. Yet I truly loved her, even when she scared me.

Because of the stress I self harmed, considered suicide, and had to go home from my job many times due to anxiety attacks and depression (which she gave me shit for). I was at one of the lowest points of my life. 

I never _did_ anything. I didn't lay a finger on her, nor did I ever dare stand up for myself because she would threaten to commit suicide whenever I questioned her behaviour. I'm not an aggressive person, quite the opposite, and I've never hurt anyone physically on purpose. I hate violence and wish people could just talk instead of fighting and killing eachother. I would never, ever, EVER hurt someone except in self defence.

However. When I finally started to realise what I was going through wasn't normal, that it _wasn't_ all my fault (shout out to my brother who talked some sense into me), I got _real_ angry. Furious. I thought about how everything would be better if she disappeared, that she should actually go through with her threats of suicide and how I could finally be free from this hell if she did. I wanted to slap her, push her, punch her. I thought about if pushing her down the stairs would be enough to kill her and if I could make it look like an accident. I had thoughts about if she could survive falling off a balcony. I kept wishing I'd get a call from her mother that she died in a car accident. I thought about the consequences of her death and if I could live with myself if I actually got away with doing something myself. I wondered how many years in prison I would get for murder or manslaughter, and how much that would affect my life after prison if I didn't get a life sentence.

I never looked any of this up on the internet. I never seriously considered anything, because it just wasn't worth it. Instead I finally broke up with her and blamed it on my own issues instead of confronting her, to avoid her going crazy and destroying my things. (She got together with one of her many male friends like a month after btw, which felt pretty shitty.) Even a year after everything ended, I truly believe the world would be a better place if she wasn't in it.

Because I'm not the only person she's manipulated, abused and used, and she will continue doing so for the rest of her days, probably until someone _literally_ beats some sense into her head.

I haven't told a single soul about my homicidal thoughts (that I've had for the first time in my life), and I probably never will (except here I guess). Maybe to my future therapist. It felt good to get this off my chest. If you read all this, thank you.",1713234429.0,
ResidentDimension295,Does it genuinely “get better” ,1,1c5aua9,9,"I (25M) pose the most generic question of all time - Does it get better? 

I’ve graduated and gotten a degree, been in and out of short and long term relationships, been heart broken but prevailed and healed, worked all sorts of jobs, done drugs, drank, tattooed my whole body, traveled, had pets. (Not listing this to say this is all there is to life, but more to provide some background information on who I am) In the next couple years I plan to stop renting and purchase my first home. Kids would be a possibility with my current girlfriend (25F) but I definitely am not in the right headspace to bring kids into the world. Would be so so selfish - so I won’t. 

Despite everything I’ve listed and my future plans  I am totally miserable. Sounds bleak but the shoe fits perfectly. I have felt this way since I can remember. Probably for more than half my life. I have bipolar and OCD which does not help my case (never taken medication for it). Both make it hard to function daily. 

I would say my social circle is small (seeing 1-2 friends once every 2-3 weeks) & frequently seeing my girlfriend. My relationship with my family and sibling is horrible - tried to fix it desperately my whole life but don’t have it in me anymore. 

That’s it really. I mope around all day acting confident and happy but in reality I don’t really want to be here anymore. Most people will say “be proactive about it. Change for the better”. Pick up a hobby, make new friends, work on yourself, diet, go for a run. Been there. Done that. Nothing works  (sounds like I have a negative outlook on life but I generally don’t). I know I’m contradicting myself. It makes sense but it doesn’t. I’m confused. That’s why I am writing on reddit.

Does it get better?

Sad-Willow-2399,Sudden attraction toward older people?(18f),0,1c5atvc,9,"I was wondering if it was normal that I’m suddenly having a very severe attraction towards older women / dudes lately. Is this something ppl experience at my age, or am I just some perv? 

So far some ppl have told me it’s fine but I’m still wary about my newfound attractions, especially when it comes to interacting w/ said group of people in my day to day. 

Just today I experienced something that started this worry for these newfound feelings that I’m having. I went to the dentist for an emergency and it was TORTURE. I couldn’t look the receptionist in the eye anymore because I was soaking wet by the time I was finished signing all the forms. (She KEPT calling me “baby,” “sugar” etc 🥲.)

Afterwards I was further mortified by how many middle aged buff guys happened to be dentists. Lead dentist / doctor was some dude w big arms, a salt and pepper beard and these sexy eyeglass frames that were KILLING me. 

Let’s just say he had to repeat himself several times and I was praying my knees wouldn’t give out after getting up and having all these guys standing over me who were previously just playing in my mouth.

Three weeks ago my dad tells me he was diagnosed with stage 5 chronic kidney disease and he's refusing treatment. No dialysis, no kidney transplant options. Two weeks ago he attempted to end his life by hanging, thinking everyone would be better off without watching him suffer. 

Last Thursday my wife rushes into the bathroom, screaming that she is bleeding, literally clots coming out vaginally and she's scared she's having her second miscarriage, this time 22 days post-IVF transfer. I scoop up what is in the toilet at 6:45 am, and she rushes to the hospital while I get my stepchildren (MY children, regardless of biology) ready for school. I drop them off, head to work because we are short-staffed and I'm working with our research doctor. I email my supervisor,  she tells me to go home and support my wife, so I do just that. 

I go to the hospital and find her sitting in a wheelchair,  bawling her eyes out, telling me she's sorry she's failed me once again by losing our third baby (first one didn't take, second one was miscarriage in 19 days). I hold her and tell her everything will be okay, that she didn't fail me. She didn't fail US. She tells me she can't go through another IVF transfer,  that it's too hard on her. I agree with her and hold her hand.

The physician assistant comes in and tells my wife that he can still see the gestational sac on the ultrasound, but since she is still early in pregnancy, he couldn't find a fetal pole or yolk, but he's convinced we still have our baby. We are overjoyed and go home. We let our fertility specialist know, and she delivers heartbreaking news, that the high hcg levels (17k count) and ultrasound provides no indication of miscarriage or pregnancy, and wants to have my wife do another ultrasound specifically to rule out subchorionic hemorrhage. Our hearts sink because we are now in limbo, uncertain whether we have a baby or nor.

Today, my wife went to get her ultrasound. She didn't expect any results today, but for the first time in weeks, we have great news.

I also didn't know how to process what I was seeing, and I just started to pretend that I didn't see anything. The 'friend' left before my mom and sister got back, and I never said anything. 

There were other experiences as well, mostly when I was a young teenager, finding internet history for sites like 'Adult Friend Finder.'

I am not sure where I can write this but I find this place to be the most appropriate place to vent out my thoughts. I currently work in the hood at a decent hotel lol.
Before I started at the place I am now, I never have been to a hotel before. I grew up relatively poor so we never really got to travel or stay at hotels ever.

I honestly did not know what to expect from this job. To be perfectly honest the job is starting to grow on me.
The main reason it is starting to grow on me is because this is the only job where I really do not feel like im being descriminated against(I'm Hispanic) the manager I have is really hands off and there is minimal micromanagement from him and the person above him as well.

The problems only start to arise with the customers. So I had no idea people did this but people actually LIVE in hotels as their home. Over the course of me working here had really good insight of how people operate/live. Since this is a hotel, we do not run credit checks or criminal BACKROUND checks so ANYONE can live here if they really wanted to. So this means I get to interact with drug addicts/criminals/felons who stay here for a long duration of time.

Anyways I work the night shift and im positive I've seen all the crimes possible while working at this place. I'm pretty sure I have been left somewhat traumatized from this place but im sort of in denial lmaooo.
You would think people would be alot more POLITE since we are providing them HOUSING and a place to STAY with all amenities included but nooo they are NOT.
It is also worth mentioning that the rent to stay here for a month is the cheapest in the area, $1200!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the area is pretty nice as well!!!! You cannot please people!!!!! You can not believe how these people have disregard for their environment and the people around them!!!!!! Of course its not all of them but I'd say 60% of them are like this!!!!!! I like to imagine these are the people who you would not wont to associate in highschool. SOme of the most immature adults I've witnessed live in hotels. There was this one couple where the wife was arguing with the husband over smoking menthols and her boyfriend actually took her phone and threw it across the grassy field.

But entering high school I had a glow up, I stopped wearing glasses, got braces and got haircuts that suit me, wore better clothing and worked out. I had attention I never received, guys actually asked for my snaps and instead of being “weird” I was a “unique” girl cause of my interest.

AtomicKittenss,I tried to contact someone to get me hard drugs. ,2,1c56m24,0,"I'll try to keep it short. I'm (28F) fairly attractive, educated, smart, somewhat cultured and funny. I'm also chronically ill, nothing life ending but I have to deal with chronic pain & fatigue which severely derailed my life. Depression, AuDHD, and diabetes. 

I don't have a support system, had a shitty childhood, my mom is mentally ill and refuses to get treatment or take her meds, dealing with her is extremely frustrating and she also happens to be a hoarder so she has made our house uninhabitable; my dad is emotionally stunted, always has been, he also rages for no reason and being around him is like being around a timed bomb that keeps going off at random; our economy is shot to hell to the point where working is useless because no matter your salary you'll end up spending it all on transport and snacks. I had a high earning job but it was a deadend, soul-sucking job and the salary wasn't that good, it's just the least shitty of shitty salaries. And my bf who made ×25 my salary kept pestering me to quit and he'd pay me double my salary. 

The only good thing in my life was my bf and our pets which we rescued and our lives together, but he is very unstable, he broke up with me before because he ""felt I didn't fit his lifestyle and life goals"" we talked it over and got back together. he did it again because he was in a bad mood, he did it a third time because I got annoyed with him for never listening to what I was saying, we had been together for more than a year but he ended it. 

I feel like shit because I feel drained, I don't want to start over, I don't want to go on dates, I don't want to meet new people, I don't want to live, really! and I'm going to miss our dog and cat dearly. 

Which brings me to right now, I was moments away from getting a high dose of a hard drug by contacting someone I know who knows a lot of drug dealers, I wanted to O.D and possibly make it look like natural causes. But then I realised that my (very irresponsible) friend would find out and blame himself for my death, and no one deserves this. 

I try to think of reasons to stay but I just would like for everything to end now, I'm sick of being sick, my physical pain is a constant, my emotional pain is even worse, I'll never have a career or a decent job, I'm lonely, and alienated by my pain and by having a vastly different outlook on life from my own society.

This is not about the break up, it was just the tipping point. The relationship wasn't that good, it felt like walking on egg shells all the time. 

I made my decision, I'm just stuck on the execution part. I don't see a point in existing anymore.

Jaded_Hell,No one disappoints as much as family does. Aha.,1,1c5a80n,0,"I have little to no family. My dad's side is nonexistent. And always has been. My grandmother died when I was around 10 in an accident. My grandfather just died today. I saw him once or twice in my lifetime. My grandmother was great. Papa and my dad's brother ...eh...never really talked to me. I met my uncle irl once. 

I guess there's many other family members om that side. But none of them talk to each other. I know no names. No one reaches out. 

My mother's side...full of the worst most toxic people you will ever come across. They've committed such vile acts against me, said the most horrible things, the adults isolated me. Made me the black sheep. It would take a lifetime to cover the abuse and pain they've all put me through.

And now I'm the bad guy for simply walking away from that toxicity in recent years. I don't have contact with my mother.


All I really have is my dad. And...no offense to him...he...isn't the best person either. He made my childhood something that has scarred me for life. I don't forgive him but I don't hate him either.



But anyways. That's enough context.

I have an aunt I try and keep in contact with. 
She has done horrible things to me. 
It is what it is.
I've had four kids. 
She never checked in.
Promised to help out. Never did. Not a single ""are you okay?"" Postpartum. 
Bought gifts only to cancel them thinking I wouldn't notice TWO kids in a row. Nothing for the first two.

And I suppose that's not really the problem. It just stings a little now that her bio kid is having her first kid she has spent over 300$ on clothes and toys for said kid and is bragging to me about it. She has mentioned it multiple times in different ways and all I can think about is the fact that I wasn't good enough for even a bib for my kids from her. 

It stings. And I don't know why. I don't know why I let it bother me. I wish it didn't. My cousin has everything I could ever wish for. 

Love. A village. Family. 

It's awkward having no family on either side. 
It's painful. Like what did I ever do to deserve this...?

Top-Dinner-281,Just said goodbye to my suicidal mother,219,1c4a9c1,28,"She is 68 and has mental health issues which have worsened over the years…bipolar, late onset schizophrenia, anosognosia.  She is now homeless living in her car.  This is her choice, she’s been in and out of many group homes.  She’s had multiple SA in the last few years but nothing hit as hard as the most recent.

  My sister watches her bank account to kind of track what she’s doing/where she’s been and there was no activity for 8 days.  She called the crisis line for a welfare check and they found her in her car.  She hadn’t had food or water in 8 days and was literally on death’s doorstep.  All the other times it was made known to others, like she actually did want help.  This time she was 100% serious and happy to just let go.  Luckily they took her to the hospital, her vitals were way off but they gave her fluids and got her stabilized.  I’m concerned about permanent heart and kidney damage.  Living in your car I  Dallas at 68 is rough. 

 She was transferred to an inpatient psych unit and has been there for a few weeks.  I flew down to see her, for 1 hour (dumb rules) and she was not psychotic anymore but she was totally manic.  She didn’t let me get a word in, all she did was talk about Jesus.  She told me about her SA and she was smiling, looking up at the ceiling as if she was recalling some fond memory.  

I truly believe she wants to go and is going g to do it again.  She will never take meds consistently and this is a constant merry go round of torture for both her and her kids.  This one hit me in the gut so hard.  I really believe I just saw her for the last time.  All my resentment and anger is gone now, o only feel love, sadness and compassion for her.  I want her to be safe and at peace, but I feel so helpless.  I don’t think she’s long for this world… I’ve been crying like 20x a day for the past week.  Grieving for the living…I kind of see her like one would see a parent with dementia I guess.  Her body is here but her mind is gone.  She is no longer the person I know.

Emotional_Fortune808,"My father made videos of me in a very disturbing situation, and it traumatized me",10,1c4s3z2,4,"As I was bleeding profusely from a deep cut on my wrist, inflicted after enduring physical and verbal abuse from my own family, my own father threatened to call the police on me. I was beaten mercilessly, my emotional pain was unbearable, leading me to self-harm for the first time in my life. Vulnerable and emotionally shattered, I found no solace as my father clicked pictures and recorded videos of my bleeding form. It was as if my suffering meant nothing to him, his only concern being to protect himself legally.  
  
I was left shocked, enraged, and numb, tears flowing endlessly as my father continued recording instead of offering comfort. His cruel words, like 'You're going to die today for sure,' echo in my mind.  
  
In his twisted logic, he threatened to file an FIR against me, branding me as a crazed child capable of suicide, merely to absolve himself of any responsibility. He went further, intending to use those images and videos to publicly shame me, all while I was just a 17-year-old minor.  
  
Instead of offering comfort, he spewed threats and recorded my anguish. When I confronted him about his heartless actions, he callously justified them, prioritizing his own well-being over mine.  
  
I was left speechless, drowning in a sea of tears, my heart shattered into countless pieces. I never imagined a parent could stoop so low. That day, a part of me died, crushed under the weight of his betrayal. Perhaps I'm overreacting, but the wounds he inflicted upon me, both physical and emotional, cut deeper than any blade ever could.  
  
To this day, he retains those records, openly admitting to keeping them for future manipulation.

Pleasant_Trouble1601,Kidnapped as ransom in Mexico and lied to for 25+ years,13,1c4size,2,"I want to try and keep this as anon as possible - this is something that happened to me and my family a long time ago that I'm just finding out about 25+ years later but I don't feel comfortable talking about this with my friends/family so I thought maybe it would help to come here.

When I was young, too young to remember, I was kidnapped by a high organized crime organization in Mexico. My mom and I were coming back from the store, my dad was home with the maid when 2 men attacked him and the maid then gassed and knocked them out. They tied her to the staircase and tied my dad up and rolled him up in a carpet. When my mom and I got home, they charged my mom to get me, hit her and knocked and gassed her out. When she woke up she was tied to the crib and I was gone. She got herself out of the duct tape and then got my dad out and started the search process for me.

Apparently, it took about a week to get me back. My dad had to stay at the home they attacked us at to take the ransom calls, they hired a kidnap specialist, my dad had to travel by himself and even was missing for a bit himself before they finally returned me to my grandpa, a few hours away from where they took me. They apparently found out the company my grandpa was working for and knew that he was coming to Mexico for a business meeting and planned this whole kidnapping and ransom. I was returned safely, but they never got the guys that did this to us.

I went my whole life without knowing this and then accidentally found out and it's really thrown me for a loop. It's hard to think that my family and I went through all of this trauma because of me. I mean, this was probably a big factor in my parents divorce. I feel like this happened and it never gave my mom, dad, and I a chance to be a normal family... 

And on the flip side, I feel as though I've been lied to my whole life. They would do things and act super protective over me, it was so frustrating and I never understood why. Knowing that my whole family has known this and I haven't just makes me feel all sorts of weird. This isn't the first time too that I've found out something about myself that I didn't know and everyone else did (i.e my dad has another kid from before me and never told my mother or I about it), so I feel very sensitive and an outsider in my own family, like an accessory for them to gossip about.

I also wish I was given the opportunity to talk to my grandpa about this, but unfortunately now he has Alzheimer's and I think this topic would be too hard on him to discuss because he was so heavily involved. And thinking about the guilt that he and my family has makes me sick. They've all had 20+ years to get over this and right when I'm starting to get ahold of my life, I need to start processing this and I don't even know where to begin. All of a sudden my sense of security and safety feels gone and I feel like who am I supposed to trust? When I go visit that home I've been to so many times, am I going to see it differently?

Internally_alone,My S/O wants to take a break,1,1c58wna,1,"And seeing how other couples in my life takes breaks with each other and end up breaking up makes me feel uneasy. My boyfriend told me out of the blue that he wanted a break from our relationship to work on his self but I can’t just shake the feeling that it is because of me. 

Some details are spared for my privacy since I know he’s on Reddit too. 

Around holiday last year, I visited him from abroad since we are long distance and have been for around half a decade but together for almost the full decade itself. I had planned the works for our holiday break; a wonderful getaway vacation, reserved a hotel, made plans to get a three course candlelit dinner with him. We’ve done this in the past with no problem. But in the first half of our vacation he was very cold to me. (He refused to show affection to me, he hardly held my hand or hugged me. He told me I was too much at one point; but he used me for his bedding frustrations and refused to sleep next to me otherwise.) Before the second half of our trip when we were about to leave for the city, right at the airport…I had no idea if he got cold feet or something, he told me he just had to go back home. I was heartbroken but understood that it was important to him so I cancelled all my current reservations and watched him go home. I spent the holidays alone afterwards and he knows I have no family. 

 About more than a month later he traveled overseas with friends on a two week trip to Asia, which frankly upset me since he never bothered to tell me about anything in his life. I never pushed for an answer but in my mind it just clicked that for like the last six months he was avoiding me. No affection, decreased attention and discussion with me. He forgot my birthday. He forgot our anniversary.  In fact, he decided that it would be a perfect time to separate from me on our anniversary even. He told me he didn’t want to break up, but he wanted to take a break so he could work on himself. That “it wasn’t me it was him,”. 
I am heart broken. 

I don’t know what I am doing wrong but I feel like I am doing something wrong. I don’t want advice. I don’t want folks to criticize him. I know he maybe is somewhat selfish but so am I. I want to be loved and I feel like no one else would settle for me because of my disability, my looks and because I’m gay. I can’t tell my family as they will never accept me.

Kawabenji77,Some days I just can't do it anymore,0,1c58r13,0,"To whom this may concern I have no idea, let me just start off with saying that my childhood started out normal however as things began to escalate between my mom and my father it seems that a divorce was inevitable. Well I don't feel like telling my whole life story to make a long story short I just feel like every time I think about how people in my family have always put other people before me how I feel like I should have been taken care of better and been taught better in my life I wasn't. It makes my blood boil to this day that my mother would choose to love her boyfriend's more than her kids, how my father is a coward who stepped out on us. How my grandparents can go magically no contact for 5 whole years and not let it be a bother to them. I'm just f****** angry I'm angry at how I should be further along at 25 but my growth was stunted because of my family holding me back. I didn't even know what credit was until like 2 years ago. I know none of this makes sense I just don't even know anymore I just feel like I just want to cry out for help because I can't take it anymore. I'm sorry.

I’ve been in a 5 years relationship with my best friend for whom I didn’t felt any sexual attraction but I had appreciation and respect for him. We were a good match as friends.. but I’m feeling that I lost so many years with this person.. 

I feel like I don’t value myself and that’s why I’m being trapped in all kinds of similar situations. It’s like I want to be cautious because I don’t want people to use me, I prefer to stay safe.

I grew up with a lot of attention, I had choices, always.. I receive a lot of compliments about my appearance and my character. Despite all of that, I engage with people I’m not in love with. 

The irony is that I know that I have the capacity to choose a better person, but I can’t decide and I found it really hard to trust someone. 
I always go back to my past. 

I also feel that all my life I said money is not important for me, I focused on spirituality, psychology, good morals. I had completely other things on my mind, but now I feel that things are different, that I’m not really smart to settle down with less when I can do a lot more.

Me and my boyfriend were hanging out like normal, and had a really good day! I took like two naps because I was SO tired and have been so busy all day, and being with him was my moment of peace. we had a little movie and boba date in the car, and just cuddled and loved on eachother a lot. once the movie was over was when I started getting tired. for the first time in God knows how long, I actually feel comfortable around a man and manage to fall asleep alone with him. I was dead asleep. when I woke up he was caressing my thighs and waist and stuff like that both times, but I didn't think too much of it when I actually was a awake and we were talking and stuff again, he suggested that we have sex in the car. broad daylight, and a beautiful day. kids were playing outside. so obviously, I said no. I came up with an excuse so he didn't feel ultimately rejected, and I was still tired. I just got off my period. I am not in the mood to have sex. he got a little pouty about it for like 5 minutes, and then went back to like touching up on my upper things and chest and stuff. I don't know if I didn't care or if I froze up. he then asked me another 5 minutes later after touching me if I was sure. I said yes, and he went back to just not talking to me or touching me at all, then started up on it again, this time actually touching me. like he tried to find it and he just didn't give up for like 10 minutes. I just let him. I felt uncomfortable and honestly just too exhausted to care. this isnt the first time he's tried to convince me to have sex with him when I'm just not in the mood.

3. Neither of them really wanted a kid as young as they had me. (Not gonna say how young in case my dad finds this 🥲)

4. My dad ""jokingly"" says he's not related to me, so that IF the time comes for a DNA test, and it turns out I'm not his, it doesn't hurt him as much.

Even when I was 14, 13, or even 12 years old, I knew how to make more money than you. Sure, you made sure I got to school, had clothing, and was fed. CONGRATULATIONS ON DOING THE BARE MINIMUM. But even then, you found a way to do that poorly.

 All you ever do is sleep and hide away in the bathroom chain-smoking. I can count on one hand the number of times we did anything enjoyable together that wasn't planned by me or an apology from you.


From a young age, I could never have any friends come over because you were safeguarding your hoard like a disgusting obese dragon rotting away on his pile of gold. This caused me to be terrified to get close to anybody and risk them wanting to come over or you wanting to meet their parents first. Not like anybody wanted to get close to the Jabba-esque kid who smelled like a Pall-Mall factory. 


I could never even tell you how I was feeling without you getting irrationally pissed off at me. I have a hard time telling anybody how I feel on any subject because of this.

Why did you never make me go on a diet so I wouldn't be wearing 52-inch pants when I was 16 years old? Why did you let me lock myself away and have zero social interaction during my formative years?

It didn't surprise me to find you passed out in the bathroom with a crack pipe (even if you swear it's not). It was even less surprising how angry you got when I found out before turning to sadness and trying to make me forgive you.

I have started to get my life back to a starting point but still have a ways to go. I've lost 90 lbs with zero help from you and need to lose another 100. I've started to make some friends, but I don't think I can actually trust them. I have an okay job. I have been growing to hate you more and more every day. I want to like you again, but I don't know how. I would rather have been beaten every day than be locked in a hoarder's house that seems to follow me everywhere. Why not abuse me in a way that I could somehow turn into a positive?

I’m 20 and I’ve been making music for 5 years now. I recently have gotten to the point where people actively choose to listen to my music. I’ve promoted my music on TikTok since January and I’ve gotten a consistent 500-600 listeners from that alone. People genuinely like my music and I’ve recently made an EP and 2 songs within that ep always get me 500-1000 views every time I use it in a video

But recently I start working on a mixtape that has a cohesive vibe and mood throughout it. I’m loving how it’s turning out, it just needs a bit more mixing, some small tweaking, and I need to redo a few vocal takes. I made 2 songs for the mixtape so far and I decided to share one of the snippets for those songs on TikTok. And after I posted it the people that follow me said they loved it, but one random dude commented and said “there’s nothing good about this song”. Normally I let hate comments just get ignored and let my followers respond if they want, but that one got to me for some reason. Since that songs new and not even fully finished it completely unmotivated me from finishing it. Listening to my voice, and my mixing, it’s not even close to how good other rappers are

yesterday, i once again caught him on a dating app by looking at his phone when he was asleep because of a gut feeling. he even hung out with the woman, but i don’t think anything happened based on the texts she sent him. it really hurts. i keep hoping that he will change, but he doesn’t. he lies about who he is talking to/where he is going. he takes MY CAR to see other women. i don’t think they even know i exist.. we live together, and i’m currently the one paying all of the bills.

Beneficial-Run6678,Are my wife and I too different for one another?,1,1c57rnm,0,"My wife, Stacy, and I have been married for close to 20 years. I'll be 40 this year, and she is 37. We have one child together; a boy who is now 3 years old. I grew up with 2 other siblings, and she had 8, but they all lived out of state. I barely have any friends. Stacy has tons due to her outgoing nature. My family, though we get together at times, we don't necessarily talk to one another every single day. My wife constantly talks to her family around the clock. Including playing video games with them almost every night. Before our child, we both worked, but after he was born, we decided it was best for her to quit her job to take care of him since I made a decent salary.

Most times after work, we hardly speak since Stacy is either talking with her family or gaming with them while I'm occupied with our child since she watches him all day while I'm at work. She's always been good at having food ready, but cleaning up around the house, doing laundry, and checking the mail are things she hardly does. At least not until it all piles up and I have to say something. It's also gotten to point where I'm so tired of arguing with her that start doing those chores on my own, and that's on top of already doing the dishes, taking out the trash, and maintaining the yard/lawn. I hardly had time to myself. I want to exercise more, but it's hard to find time for it or have a hobby. 

I don't expect her to have the chores done all the time, but I feel like she could put more effort into it, manage her time better, or at least have some sort of schedule like how she does with her family and games every night. We discussed it times before, and I even stressed that she needs to be more conscious of her health. Stacy tells me she'll do so, but that's as far as it goes. Sometimes I work remotely and notice her just lounging around the house on ger phone while our son plays by himself. Don't get me wrong, she's a good mother, feeding and cleaning our boy when he needs it. Even interacting or playing with him occasionally. I just wished she'd do better.

I didn't have much time to think about all this until she had to visit her family for three months and I  had to cook and clean for myself. Though I love my wife and son I can't help but feel like why am I married if I don't have that companionship or help around the house? So we can both have time for our hobbies/interests/goals. I've always been driven and goal oriented and don't want our child developing bad habits. Sometimes, I wonder if Stacy and I are too different for one another. Stacy often makes remarks about me being fine without a family because of how straightforward I am, and she finds me quite insensitive, but she isn't wrong.

Agile-Bag-661,"I used to be a people pleaser, and then I realized how toxic I was to others.",5,1c4ui8l,1,"I spent years being the friend who would drop everything for others. I would never say no, I would put everyone’s needs before mine. I thought it was just kindness. I thought I had the gift of relentless generosity and selflessness. I held myself to a higher standard than others because I felt I was naturally more capable of going above and beyond for others.

I would always hear people say, “it’s important to set boundaries and know when to put yourself first.”

I thought, sure, that’s a nice thought. For most people. But me? I can take it. I don’t need to set boundaries.

Realizing how toxic my people-pleasing was happened gradually and silently. For years I loved the way it felt to be unconditionally kind and forgiving—I loved feeling like I had no regrets, I had done my best in every friendship/relationship, and nothing was my fault.

In time I began to realize what they mean by “burnout.” It’s not some big powerful moment where you finally stand up for your OWN needs and everyone realizes that you deserve respect too. No.

It’s slowly, unconsciously distancing yourself from people who have emotionally drained you. It’s forgiving them over and over and never confronting them, and with each instance of forgiveness, you take another step away from them without even realizing. Until one day, you realize you resent them. You resent them for “taking advantage of your kindness,” and “repeating the same mistakes.” But by that point, you’ve become so distanced and detached from them that you don’t care about them enough to hate them. You just resent them.

So you live a lonely life. You live a life where you continue to “attract people that use you,” and you convince yourself that your kindness is a blessing and a curse. That you’re uniquely equipped with a heart of gold and that it makes you complex, that one day someone will find you and appreciate your gift. That day doesn’t come, that person doesn’t come. And you realize that while it just “wasn’t in your heart” to put yourself first or confront others, what *was* in your heart was a distorted sense of self and a whole lot of resentment. 

You realize that the people who “repeatedly let you down” were good, normal people behaving in ways that were repeatedly reinforced…by you. And that they were left to wonder why you distanced yourself from them. They were left with no other option than to try to read your mind. But by that point, you were long gone, convinced they weren’t of any value as a friend.

You realize that people who “took advantage of your kindness” were simply accepting the kindness you had to offer. It’s not their fault you didn’t realize your boundaries until it was too late for them—it’s not their job to define and respect *your* boundaries. They weren’t emotionally draining human beings. You left your drain open constantly and then blamed the water for going down.

I’m finally in a place where I can look back and realize how selfish my “selflessness” was. How destructive it was not only to myself but also to others, who I slowly and quietly abandoned because they failed my test of, “who can figure out how to respect me when I don’t even know what that means myself?”

I learned to think of “standing up for yourself” as “standing up for the relationship.” That’s all it is. Refusing to stand up for myself because I thought I was Jesus did nothing but lead me the long way to the very simple conclusion that I’m not Jesus. I’m human. And I have normal feelings that if I ignore, will rot away until I wake up one day convinced that I’m the victim.

1engel,Just heard that my ex of 9 years died in January ,5,1c4xnbq,0,"I just received a message on Facebook from his one friend that looked after him that he died in January already from a heart attack (I assume from a blood clot), as both his legs were amputated due to the effect of diabetes. 
Geez, I closed that door more than 8 years ago (been married to my husband for almost 7 years now). Even though I dealt with it at that breakup stage, his death has really shook me. I can't even cry. 9 years of my life I spent with him. 
He was actually a sweetheart, but due his tragic upbringing and life kicking him around he was broken. When I met him, he was on parole. It's impossible to explain to anyone who has not experienced it, what it feels like to live with someone on parole, you were actually on parole with them. 
He was my first gay relationship and I loved him, but he hurt me by trying to cheat on me early in our relationship. I retaliated by becoming a serial cheater, just to make me feel better. Eventually our relationship was so toxic and doomed that I ended it. He was so hurt, but I couldn't go on like that anymore. Ironically, two days after I finally said to him that I can't do this anymore, I met my (now) husband.
I'm sorry for the hurt in our relationship Entie, I tried to mend you by giving you all my love and trying to build a solid base for you, but you were just too broken. ",1713215316.0,
X_ElevenYT,"Problematic relationship with friend after he ""saved my life""",1,1c57fcx,3,"A few months ago, I attempted to end my life. During the night, I texted a friend of mine, who I've known since childhood, ""goodbye"" and told him how much I'll miss him, how much I love him, miss him, etc. I still live with my parents, so he got them involved. My mother rushed down the stairs, we got in an argument, and she stopped me from dying, her crying all the way.
The issue is, I'm really upset at him because of that, but this anger towards him is also affecting lot of other people besides us. My aunt is best friends with his mother and I worry they'll treat me different now that I cut him out of my life. Plus, he sometimes stays with my family when he's going from his home state to the university here, now he'll be forced to buy a hotel room just because of me.
I constantly feel like I should be the bigger person here and fix this broken friendship, but I also hate him so unbelievably much that I simply can't bring myself to. I don't know if I hate him because he didn't let me die or because he made my mom learn about my mental health issues, but either way I never want him in my life again. I also don't want him to suffer as much as me though because I still care about him for some reason.

maricvz,Dating a 41 year old man when I was 18. ,1,1c5792w,1,"I was 18 years old, so there was nothing illegal about the relationship, but holy shit I like to pretend it never happened because to be honest - I feel nothing but shame, disgust and anger. Again, it was legal but it’s a relationship that really fucked with me to now and still being a young adult now - I wish I can slap myself the other direction before ever meeting this man. I guess I get upset wondering what he was doing getting involved with me so young. I’m 22 now, and I wouldn’t date an 18 year old. No hate to those who have an age gap in their relationship, just my experience. I feel as if there’s not much in common to start a relationship. 

I met him through my job (not a coworker, his uncle happened to be a client), there’s no valid reason why I involved myself with this man, I can only say I was nothing but desperate, insecure and lonely. Seriously, there was nothing appealing about this man, he had no real job (He sold gold, one that he would find metal detecting at our local beaches.), he still lived with his parents, when we would spend the night together it was because he housesat for his wealthy family friends while they were constantly on vacation, he had a drinking problem and he was just nothing but a burden. 

Nobody in my family or friends know about him, my parents loved one of my ex boyfriends who i was still friends with so I would lie to my parents I was hanging out with him, I would lie to my friends that I was seeing a man who was 23 years old. Never told anyone in my circle the truth. Once, I told a close cousin before - but never shared too much information. It’s all shame and I like to pretend it never happened. He would buy liquor for us to drink, we would be sexually involved with each other, he once finished inside of me when I asked him to wear a condom I cried and stormed home after he did that, he would constantly drunk call me every night while I was at work, accuse me of sleeping with the men I work with, men I would go to school with, men who were my age because he claimed “he was once my age and knows how horny you are at this age”. Seriously, he only brought me down. I had landed myself a killer opportunity job position at just 18 that was paying me 100k+, so I was a workaholic, when I would get off from a 12 hour shift or a late night shift and would not want to see him because I was tired, he would make me feel shitty about it and it was getting to the point where my boss thought he was overworking me because I would come in tired when in reality it was because he would show up outside my job after I said I am too tired and only want to drive straight home after my shifts ended to hang out and it would have me getting home at 03:00 and need to be up for work at 09:00.

The day he claimed I was sleeping with my boss was when I decided he is never hearing from me again, it was just too much. One thing after another.  Our company was closing for a week due to a huge plumbing issue, they needed to break the floor of our old building to fix it, so we got paid leave and every employee was bragging about where their vacation spot was or what they were going to do with their time off. I was supposed to go to the East Coast, which he knew about - but my best friend’s brother died the week before we shut down, so I canceled the trip in fear I’d miss the services and my family took a two day “getaway” in a city about 4 hours away so we can come back for funeral services. My boss was vacationing with his family in that same city my family visited, and he called me stating that he knows I’m sleeping with my boss because I called off New York and went to the same city as him. Said I lied about my best friend’s brother dying to cover it all up.

I know I was pathetic for dealing with this in the first place, no pity or advice needed. It’s stupid of me to have involved myself in the first place. So much shit happened throughout that time that has stuck with me since, doesn’t make me feel less embarrassed writing and sharing how stupid I was for dealing with this shit, but it does make me feel better not fucking lying about this shitty ass relationship.

However, I know someone who has been selling it to me for years now. I do not binge it often, maybe 1-3 times a year since 2019. I just got accepted to nursing school but my grades in my two prerequisite science classes are at a D. I have no room for error on my next 4 exams coming up in days. So what did my dumbass do??

I got the bright idea to take adderall for schoolwork purposes and ended up masturbating to porn for 24 hours straight. I consumed 240mg of IR in that 24 hour window. None of my binges have ever felt like this the days following. I never want to watch a porn video again or take adderall IN MY FUCKING LIFE AGAIN. 

I find myself depressed, ashamed, and overwhelmed with studying that I have to cram for my classes. Sometimes I feel like throwing in the towel and accepting an F in my classes. This would result in me sitting out a semester and having to retake classes and reapply to a different nursing school.

ComfortableNo5383,My mom watches where I go and wants me to break up with my boyfriend ,1,1c56n3y,0,"For context, I am 19 F.  I have been with my boyfriend, 19 M for a little over one year.  We have met on an online dating app, both being from small towns.  He has not brought one red flag to this relationship, yes he does the zaza and is dealing with his own home situation(I don’t see the problem in that).  My mother, 44f does not like my boyfriend because he does the zaza, I’ve met him online and is calling him “lazy”.

  Ever since then, my mother has been restricting where I travel to, with tracking apps on my phone, cameras around the house.  She really does not want me to see him that bad, so I have been discreet in meeting him during times in the day.  To get us to break up, she’s been creating lies and manipulating me, stalking all of his social profiles to come up with lies, claiming he’s not his age (he’s shown me his id and baby book), claiming he’s cheating on me (he’s been cheated on and does not like cheaters), and claiming that she knows someone who grew up with them and they think the family is bad. (They did not grow up there, they in fact moved there when they were older) I love my mom, but I thought this was too much 

Everything came to a head on Easter night, when I had gotten into a very bad fight with my mom, and she said she was cutting off communication with me.  I was very hurt, and stormed off into my room crying to my boyfriend over the phone about how I didn’t want to loose my moms love.  He was trying to cheer me up by having us play video games together, and all of the sudden my mom came into my room and ripped the phone out of my hand.  My boyfriend thought I was getting hurt and started yelling for them to stop.  When my mom realized I was on the phone with him, she called my dad down, and a screaming match started. It ended with me screaming at him to hang up, and he did.  My mom threatened to smash my phone and take my keys away (I pay for insurance and phone service).  My boyfriend’s mom gave me an extra phone to use.

He asked if he can practice kissing with me. I was gonna say no but he kissed me before i could say no. I froze. He grabbed my butt really tight. I tried to push him off and did but it took me a while. he’s stronger than me. Sometimes he touches me inappropriately. I get frozen all the time.  
One time he asked me if we can try that while touching my butt and force pressed my head against his pants, I slapped him as my way of saying no but it took me a while to understand to situation since i get frozen in times like this. He must’ve thought that I fell into a dilemma. My eyes watery, I don’t know why. In class he touches my legs, I cant make a sound when he does. I cant tell the teacher he doesn’t really listen to me. And I don’t know how am I supposed to get ready for exams while all I think about is this. I told my brother (19) , he told me to just get over with it.

bentheprogrammer,I (32M) was really excited to boulder outside this summer,1,1c5652x,0,"Last year around late October 2023 I had just climbed my first gym V7 bouldering route. I had been working on my fitness for over 2 years and felt great. I could crush out 17 pull-ups with good form, and a lot of people started to look up to me and were inspired when I climbed. So, I was looking forward to finally being able to try my newfound strength on some outdoors boulders, which are much tougher. 

My career and personal life are amazing too. I got married 3 years ago to my girlfriend of 5 years. Job wise, as my username suggests, I got a great job as a software engineer at a national company and continue to hold my position to this day.

One day I came home from bouldering with my wife and I started to feel dizzy. Like something was off with my eyesight, balance and general vestibular function. I started having mild vertigo attacks and sitting at a computer screen was challenging. It would feel like a wave or unknown force was pulling me in one direction while I sat. It was very uncomfortable. Somehow I've managed to coupe with it after a few months. My balance is off and walking / running isn't the same, but I can still get work done.

There's also some tinnitus that's coming up, it's like a high-pitched jet engine sound in my ear. Fortunately, my hearing has been okay. I had an audiogram and my hearing appeared in the normal range. Also, I've been keeping a lot of hearing tests on my phone to see if there's a pattern that I can report to my doctor.

The imbalance hasn't gone away ever. Every single day since late October 2023 I've felt imbalanced like something either assaulted my nerve, or possibly meniere's disease. I've been to the ENT twice and had an MRI as well. The ENT doesn't want to give me the diagnosis of meniere's yet until we rule out things with neurology. Which is coming in two weeks.

As mentioned previously, I fear a meniere's disease diagnosis. The crippling anxiety of not being able to hear music again, or balance again scares me for a lot of reasons. I wanted to climb until I hit 40 and maintain my health for as long as possible. Not have a crippling disease at thirty freaking two. God-damn, I tried to do a lot of the ""correct"" things in life, and I don't think I deserve this. 

Living with a vestibular disorder is brutal. The tinnitus, mild vertigo and constant fear of a nasty disease has broken me. I finally had to just break down and cry from it all when my wife left for work today.

My once really amazing life has been kinda thrown into a dumpster fire. I've had to rethink a lot of the habits, hobbies, driving, bouldering and my gym habits have just not been great. I've worked sooooo hard to be someone, and it's just all coming crumbling down.

In the meantime, I've been working on my own games. Just doing things that make me happy like spend time with my wife and I even adopted a cat. His name is pancake and I love him

Constant-Foundation,Doesn't seem like any political parties align with my opinions/stances (California/US),1,1c5624y,3,"In a grand sense, I really don't don't like Trump or his supporters; idolizing any politician for a start is a no-go. 

On the other hand, I hate seeing how lawless/poorly run ""blue"" cities are (thinking San Francisco, etc). People who try to stop criminals are punished worse than the criminals themselves. 

So, the issue is I don't want to see Trump re-elected but I also don't want to see democrats elected at a state/local level. But I also know voting third-party is a waste. 

But ON THE OTHER HAND, it seems like nobody (blue/red) gives a shit about insane rent and inflation. Red wants to reduce taxes ""to help the middle class"" but it disregards the issue of rent/inflation. Blue wants to spend more on social services but also disregards rent/inflation. 

I do care about social issues but I feel like those sadly need to take a back-seat since we are making life impossible for the lower/middle class. 

It seems like the only way to actually affect things (without rioting and destroying the property of other lower/middle class people who don't deserve to lose their possessions) is to simply abstain.

I’ve never been much of a conversationalist but I can into uni wanting to change it up and make more friends. With a month left in the semester, I’m realizing I have yet to make a single real friend. Typically just spend my time working by myself. 

I’ve been trying to get more involved in new activities and putting myself out there bla bla bla. None of this is working. 

I feel once I have a reason to talk to someone it’s not to difficult from there, but what do I have to start a conversation about?

I understand that it being situational is a being situational is a big part of it. You sit next to someone, you have a class with them, etc. Bu how do I start a conversation with someone I’m not in a specific situation with? No classes, no mutual friends. There is one girl that I’ve been thinking about particularly. Her room is down the hall from mine ( I 19 male also lives in dorms). I often pass by her in the hall, simply wave, smile, and keep walking. I really want to talk to her but what do I say. As far as I know we have nothing in common. 

 What can I say so both of us stop to have a conversation. We know each other by name but that’s about it.  What can I possibly bring up to get here to stop and have a short conversation. Enought to ask for socials or something. 

I can’t end off the year not having talk to anyone. Will be a shitty summer lol. Anyone that took the time to read this and offer some advice, Thank you. ",1713237222.0,
HoshiAndy,I deserve nice things! ,1,1c55tvq,0,"I’m like not exactly broke. And not living paycheck to paycheck but I’ve lived kinda poor for like my whole life.

And since that, I’ve always planned things ahead. All my finances are planned out, and everything. But.

I just decided to take an impromptu trip ! The trip isn’t entirely expensive! I’m going to NY! 

I think total, the trip might cost 500 dollars. Maybe. 500-600 for travel and hotel fees and extras! 

And to me that’s a lot of money. 

And all of the money I have and make is all accounted for. 

And I have a LOT OF PLANS. For the money I have and for the future money I’ll get from work. 

But this impromptu trip might just kinda messed up my
Plans a little and I’m getting like a little
Anxious over everything.

Anabelieve,I failed at everything I ever wanted to achieve,2,1c50q8f,0,"It’s one of the saddest truths I’ve ever had to accept. Life hasn’t always worked out in my favor and it just pains me to know I put so much effort into so many things that were never able to flourish growing up. Even my own body now is fighting against me. Mentally, emotionally, physically. The days blur by and I honestly don’t know what to even look forward to besides doctor appointments. I feel like a complete failure and such a huge burden on family and friends. They all look at me with pity now, even if not intentional. I keep asking myself, what’s next? More bad news? Why can’t my mind think of anything else besides worst-case scenarios? What am I even holding on for? It’s a mixture of guilt and self-hatred that seems to take over now. Even though everything sucks now, life is still beautiful but yet this sadness tells me otherwise.

Freddy_mercuryscat,I feel embarrassed that I let someone cross my boundaries ,3,1c4xgma,0,"So I met an old school friend a few days ago. We went to school together, so it's been 7 years since then. However, I am in contact with some of my school friends, even though we don't meet frequently, we chat online and stuff so I just trust my school friends yk, we grew up together  afterall and they all treat me like a sibling more or less, purely platonic. This dude I was meeting, let's call him J, wanted to meet up to catch up because we now live in the same town. We had met once 2 months ago, but only for an hour because he got late and I was busy, so it was a brief meet. This time, he wanted to meet properly and asked me to clear my schedule, and he would do the same. Usually, I don't stay out late at night because of the curfew at my hostel, but I made arrangements to come back around 12 or 1 am. We met at around 8:30 pm and stayed at that restaurant until around 12. Then he suggested I stay at his place if I got late, but I declined as I have a hostel. I'm not sure why, but I didn't oppose him strongly, and we ended up going for a drive. We stopped at a local food place where we ate a little, and it started raining, so we sat there for a while. He then suggested I come to his place, and I agreed. However, I started feeling uncomfortable because I only see him as a friend, and I assumed he meant the same. He mentioned watching TV, and we started talking. He began telling me about his ex and how they didn't have sex because she wanted to maintain her purity until marriage and he respected that because he is the type of person who likes cuddles and hugs more than sex.. It was an awkward conversation for me so I was just like- ""Oh that's cool"" , ""you're  so thoughtful "" etc. 
But then he started getting physically close like he had his arm behind my back while we were on a couch and I just instantly moved away to maintain some distance to which he probably felt embarrassed and started explaining how he always rests his arm like that and I felt bad for making him feel bad so I said ""yeah it's okay"" .It was late so even if I was uncomfortable I didn't think of taking a cab. 
Then he was like it's late so let's just sleep, I assumed I'll be sleeping in livin' room and him in bedroom but he was like but my bed is big enough so we can sleep in my bedroom and then said some things that made me feel bad for judging his intentions so like a fool I agreed to sleep in his room on his bed. 
And then we were on the corner of the bed with distance and he was like do you wanna cuddle and I said No and he again started explaining that cuddle just means hug to him and why tf did I say no in a rude/harsh manner. I already suffer with boundary and self esteem issues so I was like, don't get me wrong but I see you as a friend and I don't exactly cuddle with my friends like that but he said that it's totally normal. 
To avoid the awkwardness of me saying no, we started talking about random topics but somehow moved close to me and started hugging me regardless. I was uncomfortable but then he said - see this is what I mean by cuddling, it's so comfortable. Bruv I wasn't comfortable but he was soo big and soo sooo soo heavy compared to me I didn't even think of pushing him away because the efforts would be futile and I was just frozen then he said that I could keep my legs on his legs for comfortable position and I didn't move at all but eventually I just put my arm on his shoulder (I don't know why tf did I do that, I know it was my fault so I know that I lost all rights of complaining about it ) but...no it was just ...not good for me. Honestly I was feeling disgusted but I didn't do anything about it and I am grateful that he did nothing more but his hand was on my waist and my top kinda was pulled up and he kept touching my skin and it was soo disgusting,  disgusting is the only word to describe it. I had already set an alarm for morning 6 am and I was just waiting for it to ring and as soon as it did I ran away...like booked a cab and ran away. Came back home and scrubbed myself off with two different bodywashes because I kept smelling his disgusting deo/perfume on my skin and then I shared this with my friend over breakfast and he kept blaming me for going to his place in the first place and I felt even more worse. I know I was at fault, I know dammit but still. 
Also I know he didn't se*ually assault me or anything but even that ""cuddling"" was bad enough for me. 

Then I unfollowed him from instagram after a small text of ""the previous night was uncomfortable for me so I don't see this friendship going anywhere"" and he kept calling me but I didn't answer and he texted me on another app that why was I ignoring him and how I am making him feel bad for that day. I could've just said that it made me feel uncomfortable and that we should just meet at public places from now on but instead I made him a villain. I apologised to him and said that I was meeting him as a friend and I am extremely guarded about my boundaries so it just wasn't comfortable for me and he was like - did I kiss you, what did I even do, we just cuddled etc etc. At this point I was feeling embarrassed and I kinda was like ..yeah it was my fault for not making myself more clear to you so don't worry about it but I would be cutting you off, you didn't do anything wrong. 

And he said that he felt relieved after hearing that and said ""bye"". 



Idk why I am sharing this, I just wanted to tell someone about this and my real life friends would just consider me pathetic and a pushover if I said all this so probably this is a safe space.

Nothing I have been planning is going accordlying to my plans...

I can lose a downpayment of 21k for my first apartment because the banks don't want to offer me a mortage because my salary comes from a foreign country (i live in a 3rd world country... they said at the beginning that it wasn't a problem). They asked for all this paperwork about MY ENTIRE LIFE and money movements and SO ON, and 2 weeks later I text to every agent to know if I can obtain the mortage... CRICKETS

IT DOESN'T WORKS ANYMORE. And my boss wants to test it ASAP. I feel so stupid and useless because I don't understand what is happening anymore (and it's not the only project that is behaving like this, I don't understand what's going on, what if I lose my job? I'm so scared)...

Then I have a lot of acquaintences but not a single friend to talk about how I am feeling... I asked them about their lifes and what's going on and they say ""good!"" and that's it, they don't ask me the same. And my best friend doesn't share with me about her life anymore!! I know she's alive because she shares in social media about her son, husband and lovers OH but she text me to ask me to choose names for her stupid tiktok account (she has changed the name of her account like a billion times I don't understand what's her fucking goal with that and that's the only thing she talks to me about, nothing else).

And my family has their own problems to worry, I don't want to annoy them... and I'm sure they are going to say ""aaaww poor thing that happened because you wanted to reach to high, you should stay quiet in your childhood bedroom forever"" or something... 

I received today ONE good news that I was accepted to be part of an event (it's about my hobby) but I can't participate because I don't have the money to pay for the space thanks to the downpayment I made for the apartment that maybe I will lose... and I haven't done anything about my hobby because I'm depressed, tired and stressed about everything else.

Iateyourcarpet,I don't know how to handle life,1,1c55hsx,3,"I'm just gonna keep it short and simple. Would love if people gave advice on how to deal with it.
So basically I'd like to start off by saying Im 16 and I use comedy to cope with everything. And when the memes talking about ""thugging stuff out"" came along I sticked to it. And now whenever something happens to me or bad thoughts in my head appear I just tell myself to thug it out, or say it's future me's problem. But I fear it might get to the point where I won't be able to say that and actually have to deal with the issues.

EveryoneHatesAdam,I love my girlfriend but after today I’m worried about our future together. ,1,1c55clj,1,"She is 27, and I am 25 M.

Super long post but thanks to anyone who reads. This touches on lying & addiction.

She has a history of horrible addiction and still struggles with it to this day with alcoholism, but I still love her and choose to be with her.

There was a situation in the past where she made a small lie about something that wasn’t important, but I was upset she lied out of principle . We spoke about it she said she wouldn’t do it again.

On her birthday about a month ago she wanted some Adderall.  I wasn’t too fond of the idea with her situation but at the end of the day let her know it’s her decision to make. She ended up taking some.

Fast forward to last night, we’re getting ready to go to bed and it’s 4 am. She sets an alarm for 7 am. I ask why, as this is very unusual of her, and she says “so I can let the dogs out” I turn over and go to sleep.

I then wake up to the alarm before her. I turn it off and as I hit snooze on the alarm I see the first message say “I’m about to be on the way to put it in the mailbox” knowing what is up already I verify to check my suspicions, and yeah; she purchased some behind my back without mentioning anything and proceeded to lie to me about it. And her plug told her she’d be there at 7 am, hence why she had the alarm set. She was lying since the night before.

I act like I don’t know and wait for her to go downstairs. We have an alarm system in the house that sounds when you open the front or the patio door alerting “front door” “patio door”

So I ask “why did you open the front door?” 

She says “I thought my aunt was here” lie #2 
When we wake up fully for the last time in the morning she asks why I’m upset. I again ask her why she set an alarm for 7 am and she said “so we could do stuff together” lie #3. And crazy enough a different answer than her original lie.

I end up calling her out and she asks if I went thru her phone. I tell her once I set the alarm off the text was the first thing I saw.

She ends up apologizing and explaining she was just scared of my reaction.

I tell her it’s unfair to keep things from me and lie to me based on a hypothetical of how I’d react especially since I’m not her previous partners who were really toxic.

We hugged, we made up, but thinking about it now I still feel bitter with how many times she lied to me back to back. She promised nothing but honesty from now on, but I don’t know I believe that, and I don’t know if this is a slippery slope of her getting back into addiction again.",1713235666.0,

AnActualGhost,"I’m not as good at maintaining relationships as I used to be and I feel so bad about it, but can’t seem to fix it.",1,1c55bzl,0,"2022/23 were the worst couple years of my life.  They were pretty traumatic and I ended up self isolating pretty severely. Until that point I had lots of friends and I felt so close to them all. I never forgot to call them, text them, send them postcards, invite them to get togethers. I was always meeting somebody somewhere or just spending time doing nothing together with somebody. It was so easy to just be with people and be myself with them.

 Now I make so little effort. It doesn’t even occur to me to reach out. I don’t ever really want to go anywhere or do anything. I mean, I want to until it’s actually time to do it. Then I wish I’d never made the plans.

 I feel lonely but overcoming it and being close to people again feels insurmountable. It feels like I don’t have the time but I know I do, I just spend most of my time zoned out and doom scrolling now. I just feel rushed and anxious when it’s time to see a friend now and it makes me instinctively avoid it.  

I miss being comfortable with people so much. I miss my friends. I keep thinking I’m over everything that happened but I guess I’m obviously not. I just wish I could get back to the person I was before, but I don’t know how. It was so much easier before. ",1713235618.0,

newsensations1198,(M25) I moved to Brooklyn in September after living in Boston for 5 years.,1,1c55505,1,"My band relocated to Brooklyn over a year ago, and after spending most of that year traveling to New York from Boston for shows I decided that moving here was the logical path for my career.

  
I moved to Boston in 2018 to go to college there, graduated in 2022 and then stuck around for a year after, deeply immersed in the Boston music scene. I got to Brooklyn in September 2023 but since I moved here I have felt miserable and hopeless.

  
I don't like it here. I thought I would learn to love it since I used to dream of living here. My takeaway so far is that it's expensive, noisy, scary, lonely, tired, and bleak. It just doesn't feel good here and I'm having a hard time understanding how anybody wants to stay here. I look at people's faces every day and see them dreaming of elsewhere.

  
I wake up from a near paralyzing shock of anxiety and aching guilt and worry that I'm wasting time every morning; that's the only thing that makes me get out of bed. Even on the days where I have absolutely nothing to do, I still have this feeling. It doesn't feel like motivation, it feels like a sickness. I had to resort to self medicating with weed for a while, but it doesn't work anymore.

  
There was a girl I was seeing for the last few months I was living there, a girl that worked down the street from me. I fell in love with her and haven't been able to move past it since. I can't stop thinking about her and I miss her so much, but I deleted her number in December. She was taking days, then weeks, then a full month to reply to my texts. I would text, excited for a response, and then when it wouldn't come I would start worrying and self deprecating. As the time between responses got longer I became unhealthily obsessed to the point of depression, starving, and suicidal ideation. I still think about her all the time.

  
I keep 'giving it a shot' (everybody tells me that it takes a year to adjust to living here) but nothing is changing for the better. Just little poofs of fleeting joy.  
I recall how excited I was to be moving to Boston to go to college and how even though it was tough for a whole year, I never once experienced ""homesickness"", which is a feeling I've been drowning in since I moved to Brooklyn.

  
All in all, I have met a few nice people here, but my heart just isn't here. I don't see a future I like in this place or any of these people. Most of my friends still live in Boston. I'm still decently active with music, but feeling completely demotivated. I can't write anything.  
I'm tempted to move back, but I'm afraid that I'm potentially running back to something that's not there for me anymore, or that I'm chickening out.

Rich-Bathroom565,I [16f] will never drink again as it turns out I cannot handle alcohol whatsoever,0,1c592hu,1,"First of all, my reason for my drinking was all wrong. It was to numb the pain and as a means to an end. This was at a wedding where I was the maid of honor.

I am also 4’11 and 112lbs. I had 6 glasses of wine, all filled to the brim, and every glass was a different type. Apparently that was also a big no no (mixing alcohols). 

This was my first time drinking in public. Apparently for my height and weight, I also drank wayyy too much. 

Apparently I jump a lot when I’m drunk. My legs hurt for a week after, especially because I was in 4 inch heels. I killed my feet

I threw up all over the floor in numerous places and in the toilet.

I forced strangers to take selfies with me.

My shy ass gained confidence and spoke to every single person in the venue. 

Someone said I had no class while drinking.

Alcohol was free flowing even though I didn’t ask for any, it was just continuously poured into my glass. And yes, I know, I had a choice to not drink but I did and I regret it. 

Alcohol doesn’t even taste good - my throat burned badly. 

I was very touchy to random people. Thankfully, they weren’t angry. 

My vision was very blurry and I kept running into things. 

I had a massive headache. I thought drunk was supposed to be a pleasant experience. 

My dad thought all of this was hilarious .

Mom was angry at me saying I kept trying to take off my bra talking about how uncomfortable it is and that my dress rode up so many times that everyone knew my panty color. 

People were very nice though. They mostly kept me out of sight from the security guard. Some other minors were drinking I think but I’m not sure.

Everyone in the wedding was so fucking attractive all of a sudden. 

My mom told me to calm down because I was embarrassing

Bride was confused on everything 

Apparently I gave an absolutely AMAZING speech. It was a long poem about the couples love, and people kept on complimenting me and even suggesting writing commissions… 

A nice man put his suit jacket on me when I was cold, but when he did it somehow became too hot. 

I cried my heart out to people and trauma dumped 

It was a 9 course meal and a cake as well as pastries and I chose the cake flavor. But for some reason everything tasted disgusting and made me nauseous. The amazing looking cake tasted sour and bitter. I could barely eat too, and I felt terrible because it was like caviar and wagyu!

I ate jellyfish, kangaroo, wallaby, shark fin, emu, wild boar, quail, crocodile tongue, a bird nest? 

At some point it felt like no one was speaking English. Maybe they weren’t 

This one I’m disgusted with. It’s possible I tried to get close with middle aged married men. Thankfully they were all understanding. 

The groom and other people were getting doped in the corner or something, weed has such a weird and strong smell. I think I coughed a but. It hurt my throat. 

I don’t remember anything else but that’s from the top of my mind. A kind woman sat me on a swing and told me to breathe. The swaying made it hard though. I was also telling the bride about toes for some reason?

Sorry this is so messy it’s just a rant. 

But worst of all- that night ended around 3am and I had a flight back to america at around 7 or 8am. I was so hungover the airport hurt to be in. I had no energy to carry luggage and my legs (that I abused by jumping in heels) were killing me. I had blisters all over my feet too. My gross ass apparently ate some nail polish off of my fingers. 

EVEN WORSE. I had school that same day I got back to America after being in the air for 25 hours not counting layovers. And I had a huge exam. 

I was blacked out in my classes after being 3 hours late to school. I also failed the huge exam with a 53. BUT I gave all my professors a souvenir and told some of them about my drunken antics (why the fuck though? My best friend told me in front of the professor why the fuck I would say that to him. I completely agree with her.)

PiscesAnemoia,I don’t like blonde people…,0,1c54paa,2,"Ever since I grew up, every blonde person has been such an ass to me. In middle school, this blonde girl made crazy allegations against me. As an adult, I worked with a blonde guy that was a total dick and easily got passive-aggressive for no reason whatsoever - he was also kind of a junkie. On top of all that, I always get into stupid arguments and confrontations with them - usually where they misconstrue something I said or claim I „implied” something I didn’t at all. To be fair, I think the latter is done by people in general. I feel like whenever I speak my mind, ESPECIALLY and mostly over the internet, people misunderstand me or spin it into something out of charts. It’s so mentally exhausting. I guess, for some reason I just noticed this with blondes more.
I also ran into a good handful/heard or watches about some that were into degeneracy and drugs - guys that may have been into child pornography and ditsy club girls. Obviously, that exists everywhere, regardless of hair but it just seems more common to me with them. Maybe I was just unlucky but it’s left a poor impression on me. I don’t know why Hitler put them on the pedestal. I know the man was daft but this just doesn’t make any sense.
Those that I or others I know have ran into that seem intelligent, have come off as snobby, extremely judgmental and condescending - as if to think they’re better than everyone else. Sometimes just cold, soulless and calculating. It’s actually a little creepy. They just seem like an unfriendly folk. 

Speaking of which, blondes strike me as really uncanny. Their big round blue puppy eyes that seem to subconsciously relay “help me, i’m suffering” As if they’re in some sort of misery because of their blondness. It’s..almost tranced or something. Children of the corn. Somehow I get the feeling that their voices are high, elvish. But then you hear a croaky and deeper voice than you expected. This whole cult-like „Vikingtog” behavior creeps me out. They also all share this WWII guilt. It’s like they’re in a common group or something and every one of them, that I’ve ran into have been left-wing. Up until recently…starting in 2021, I started hearing blondes talk conservative positions. It caught me off guard. It’s like the younger generation are rebelling or disagree with the older ones.

I spoke to a therapist about all this and my experiences and they basically just told me to watch myself as it could be perceived as prejudice. I don’t have any issues working with them or anything but if I don’t have to, I just keep my distance. 

I also had an odd experience where a blonde girl was staring at me. She worked in some hospital and she was just…watching me and doing the whole mouth thing that some women do. I chalked it up to nothing and moved on. I mean, it’s a hospital. What is there to think? Then I happened to see her in public and she did it again. I later happened to see her a third time. I was not in a good mood and she asked me if I was alright and if I wanted to vent and talk about it. I thought this was strange and confusing.

Anyway, I think blondes could fit the category of an ethnicity of some sort. They all share certain physical features and seem to…do their own thing. They also have their own problems, such as not having light enough makeup and obviously there are stereotypes. I think they may have their own agenda and are at war with me because I never get along with them.

I had one blonde social worker who was kind to me but maybe it was an act, actually hated me and they were going to stab me in the back.

The irony of all this? I have blonde in me myself. I was born blonde and blue eyed but my hair darkened to a very golden brown. So I feel like I can get some insight into both worlds and expose secrets. Maybe that’s why they hate me.",1713233757.0,

WantsToSleepAgain,My hard work didn't pay off,2,1c4z79s,0,"I applied for psychology at a university I wanted to attend, but in the Netherlands, we have dixed seats (600 in total and there were 2300+ applicants) 

We had to take a test to receive a score that would help us determine what rank we would get. Based on your scores there were 3 groups you could be placed in.
Group 1: Top 200 scores and would all get a seat
Group 2: Middle group which would have a greater chance of getting in than group 3
Group 3: Lowest group and barely a change.

I got 49/60 questions righ, but got placed on group 2. The people on group 2 got a seat based on a lottery style system. They would randomly draw a name and that person would get the next rank (so starting from 201 and onwards).

If you didn't get into the top 600 immediately there would still be a chance you would get it as a lot of students also decline their seat. So from 601 until 800 have a pretty good chance. Last year the highest ranking to get a seat was 817.

I got ranked 941. So I am almost but guarenteed to not get a seed. I feel devastated as all my hard work feels like it is for nothing because of a lottery. I don't want to sound arrogant but I feel like my score would be in the top 600.

theanonymousblt,Was I sexually harassed..?,1,1c548q3,1,"So yeah I think I was sexually harassed, or at least the victim of some kind of misconduct, idk. 

In short, I’m a college student, (im a cis male) and I work for a dining location close to campus. In September last year, (I was 19 at the time) one of my managers (23 I think, cis woman) said to me “you have beautiful eyes.” I shook that off, cause ppl compliment each other casually all the time, right? Then a few days later, she asked if I had a girlfriend. That confused me a bit, and got weird gut feelings when she asked that. Again, I shook it off cause I just assumed it was casual, but weird small talk. 

Then, two weeks after that, she came up to me while I was at the register, stared at me really intently, and said: “you should ask me out.” I laughed it off and declined, but the weird, uncomfy gut feelings kept flaring up, and they still do every time I’m around her. 

Then, she persisted with really weird gestures. For example, when leading me to a storage room (showing me where some cleaning supplies were), instead of just telling me to follow her, she grabbed up on my bicep. This happened several other times afterwards. Also, if she laughed at something I said, she’d casually place her hand on my chest. She’d also stare at me with this look that genuinely discomforted me every time. 

I also recently found out she’s had multiple affairs in this work place. Firstly, slut shaming is bad, always will be. But when it’s at a singular work place, and I was almost one of those people (and uncomfortable throughout), finding that out made me feel a bit worse. Not to mention, every dude’s she’s been with at my location, it just makes the workplace SOOO toxic. Plus, she’s an incompetent boss in general—blames her failures on us, is genuinely bad at her job, etc. all my coworkers feel the same way. But I digress. 

This is where I’m conflicted. I’m a white, cisgender male. I’m in a really privileged place in society, and because of that, I don’t feel that I ought to worry about stuff like that happening to me. But, I cannot shake away the weird, icky, almost itchy discomfort I got with virtually every interaction with that manager. 

Am I looking too deep into it? Should I talk to HR about it? (Although, they’re notorious for being useless here). I barely knew this manager when it happened. I also feel genuinely uncomfortable when I’m around her. But I also don’t wanna sound all woe-is-me, you know? I wanna hear y’all’s opinions on this. Idk what to think or feel, and I also wanna do something about it. 

I should also add, thankfully I haven’t seen her all that much cause our schedules don’t align. But despite all the aforementioned happening months ago, it still doesn’t take away from the discomfort I feel when I’m around her, on rare occasion. ",1713232427.0,

The reason I think that is because whenever a celebrity male gets his 🍆 leaked online… they joke about it constantly and call them small. Like the Nelly leak or recently the leak of a popular streamer. If they are considered small to alot of black women.. then im thinking about just dating a completely different race entirely. I’ve recently come across the term “size queen”.. a few minutes ago and it describes exactly how Ive always felt as it relates to black women and their size expectations. They literally expect all men (especially black) to be hung like a damn war horse. It seems like unless you are swinging by the knees… you’re small. Its honestly disheartening to and especially frustrating because it’s nothing I can do about it.

so today, i got a rejection from the one internship i thought would accept me. they reached out to me and i had a connection with the dean. yet it was the same as the 65+ applications i have done previously, rejected. if you are in my field, you know that number is fucking ridiculous. it's made worse by consistently being around people who are gloating about the myriad of all opportunities that they get. like my fucking roommate will never accept that their nepotism is part of what got them here because their resume is literally half of mine, the only thing that's helping them get in is because they're part of a program that their older siblings got them into. 

but whatever, that's not me. i'm from an area that's business-rich, not science-rich, and that was always fucking clear based on how horribly people treated me. and i was so excited to be able to leave, to not be around people who just fucking treat me like i'm nothing because i'm not in their crowd and my family is not rich. for the the past three years, i have been praying so hard, hearing that it will only get easier the older i get because they prioritize seniority. well guess what- that was an absolute LIE. i get those automated emails saying ""make sure to apply next year"" and i just wanna shake them on the shoulders and be like **""you moron! there is no next year! this is all i have left!""** and then when i ask for help, all i get is a fucking list of jobs that are either closed or corporate, and we all know how hard the corporate ones are to get into! i don't have any connections! my parents grew up poor and no one in my family has sniffed beyond a bachelor's degree!

i'm so beyond done with it. it is a constant thing in my life where i get praised for my work ethic but have i EVER reaped the rewards? no. never a promotion, a position, it's all just a pat on the back. all i face is rejection. 7/9 schools in undergrad, every single leadership position i have ever applied for, every single internship. i only get stuff if there is no other option. it is clear with the rejections and my lab that i'm probably not meant to be in this field if all i get is misery. but there is nothing else for me, i don't know what else i would do.",1713215343.0,
No-You-6629,I have to put my daughter’s dog down today,15,1c4ilgh,7,"I bottle fed this puppy found abandoned under a dumpster as my effort to volunteer for an animal rescue agency. I was to foster it until it could be adopted. I could tell from a very young age that something wasn’t all there in this dog’s head. Almost like schizophrenia but dog form. Well even though every other dog that has ever been in my home went on to get good citizen certification from my efforts, I never could get this dog to act right. 

The dog attached itself to my daughter and well, it just never could get adopted, so its pretty much been her dog. I suggested to the animal rescue that there was some behaviors that were just out of my skill range to handle, as this dog confuses aggression with play as most recently evidenced by what I will say in a moment. That agency shut down and never retrieved the dog so I have had it for years now. 

The dog has always been a bit territorial~ or just angry at anyone outside of my immediate family that resides in my home. Had a close call some years back where I thought it bit a kid but just scared them. The dog is an escape artist, and has gotten out of kennels, doors, fences that all have extra precautions in place. I tried to save this dog from itself. I have a personal line that I draw with aggression from animals, and if behaviors cant be fixed in a reasonable amount of time then that animal just isnt safe. I was guilt tripped by my wife and children into abandoning my boundary with the animal. Well while I was outside the home recently, the dog somehow got out of a locked kennel, through 2 different doorways, and out of the fence to go and attack someone walking their dogs. The person wasn’t severely hurt, and had no puncture wounds, but the dog tore their clothes and knocked them down making them get scrapped up and bleeding. Also attacked their dogs but no serious issues. All on camera, and the dog stayed wagging its tail the entire time, which is another example of not knowing the line between aggression and play.

I have tried to surrender it, rehome it somewhere that can deal with these behaviors but to no avail. I am left with no choice but to put it down or suffer legal consequence, and potentially put someone else at risk. Morally I am clear, biblically (if that matters to some) clear, legally clear, but I cant help but to feel guilty for taking away my daughter’s “friend” and that I feel like I failed the animal.

My sister (23F) and I (21F) are both in college and my sister is graduating with an engineering degree this year. I am going to pharmacy school after this semester for a few years.

For about a year now, my sister has pointed out how I get more attention, how I am told things before her in every situation, how our parents go to me first about things before her. Last year, I went to Universal Orlando without her and she was upset that she couldn't go because of how her school operates. My dad felt bad, so he bought her tickets to a concert for a singer she really likes. She's also mentioned how our mom goes to me first before her when she's going to bed and telling us goodnight. I'm afraid of our parents telling me something without her present because I don't want to make her upset.

This year, we were both able to go to Universal and I wanted to make it the best trip for her since it was her first time. Throughout the trip, she kept mentioning about how she was the last person to be told things. She didn't know about a rocket launch happening near our hotel, but I did because our grandma mentioned it while we were at the park. The next day, she made a similar remark about how she didn't know about some event going on that day even though we mentioned a few times and I broke down. I had to leave the room that we were in so I wouldn't cry infront of our grandparents because I cry very easily (I wish I didn't cry that quickly). She came to see me a few minutes later. She apologized for making those comments, mentioning that she didn't mean anything by them, but it stung everytime she complained about something I was involved in.

Recently, I started crocheting and I decided to make daisies for my uncle and cousins since my aunt passed away and I couldn't make it to the funeral. My sister couldn't make it either, so our parents took the daisies with them and gave them to my uncle. Just today, my parents got a letter from my uncle and I got one too, thanking me for the daisies. My sister got home and noticed the letters and immediately mentioned ""I saw the letters, and there's not one for me."" I couldn't talk to her so I said nothing.

I don't even know if she realizes that it hurts me every time she makes those comments. I even asked her one time what I should do to prevent this and she said ""there's nothing you can do."" I hate that I get more attention and I don't even like mentioning my grades to our parents or her because I get better grades than her and she always has to mention that I do sooo much better than her at everything. I don't even want a graduation because she's graduating and I don't want to take away her day since she struggled so much and deserves the day to herself. I just want to live my life without someone trying to punch or kick my self-esteem.

I'm giving her some leniency since she is taking 6 classes and has a job while I only have my job and 4 classes, but it stings everytime she mentions how I'm somehow one-upping her and I don't even realize it.

Am I being too selfish? Or is there something I should change? Should I be more attentive of her? If anyone has any idea as to what I should do, please let me know.

She’s lost probably a third of her original body weight in this time and has an entirely new wardrobe as a result. It’s a substantial physical change, and she’s now notably smaller than she was when we first started dating, with a very different body type.  
  
While I’m happy that she appears to be pleased with the changes, those same changes have led to a near total collapse of my physical attraction towards her, and it’s only getting worse. I’m only attracted to heavier women and I always have been. She’s now so small that I’m severely struggling with attraction and desire, despite the fact that I do love her so much. I'm sick over this.  
  
She hasn’t brought up the “why” behind this abrupt change at all and won’t really talk about it. I know that seems like an odd communication gap for something like this. But for context, she’s had body image struggles centered on weight in recent years and tends to wall off any discussion remotely related to it, which has stymied a lot of direct conversation about this change (even in early attempts months ago). In the end, I figured it was her body and her business, of course, so she could do whatever without it being a big deal. But what I wasn’t expecting was how severe the transformation was going to be. What I do know is that the weight loss is not chiefly due to health concerns, since she was/is in excellent health.   
  
Whatever the underlying reason, the approach of simply rolling with it isn’t working due to impacts on intimacy. While more goes into attraction than just physical features, the absence of attraction to her new body makes it a lot harder to do things that were once effortless, often in ways I wasn't anticipating. When we cuddle, I miss the way her body used to feel. I touch her, and it feels like touching a stranger; there’s just so much less “her”. Hell, even *looking* at her feels like looking at a stranger. It’s getting to the point where I don’t really want to be intimate anymore. Since my desire has tanked, our sex life has declined precipitously.   
While my love for her hasn’t changed, I’m quickly losing my ability to see her in a sexual manner. And if she hasn’t noticed this already, she’s inevitably going to.  
  
To be clear, she knows that I’m only attracted to bigger women. So, on the one hand it’s not like this should be that surprising. But it’s possible she thought I’d just deal with it or adapt somehow. It’s also possible she simply doesn’t believe someone could have this strong orientation, and disregards what I’ve shared with her in the past. Diet culture and societal pressures are potent forces, and I know to this day she instinctually gravitates to the “thinner = better, always” messaging. She may think this applies to attraction as well.  
  
As she’s lost weight and continues to do so, I’ve already investigated completely changing what I’m attracted to on my own, hoping that would work. Most advice on how to address attraction loss after a partner’s major body changes is geared towards changing your perception of weight *gain*, since this is by far the most common issue people experience. This involves deprogramming biases from social inputs that malign bigger bodies. Of course, this approach doesn’t apply in my case. I've even tried watching adult content with smaller women to perhaps reprogram myself. This was poor advice, and I got nowhere and it felt alarmingly similar to conversion therapy or something.  
  
Other advice for the opposite situation is subtly encouraging them to “adopt healthy habits” to induce their weight loss, which is a normalized but highly manipulative approach. I’m not interested in nudging her to do the reverse.   
  
I’m just getting hopeless over where this is all heading. She looks and acts like a person entirely different from the one I dated and married. I barely recognize her anymore. I used to really like baking and cooking for us (and with her, which was always a fun thing we did), but it feels like a chore now because she doesn’t truly appreciate or enjoy food anymore. With the diet apps, she can’t. It’s been hard to go through that kind of effort for someone who now views a fundamental, basic pleasure of the human experience to be a burden; it just sucks all the life out of it. So, it’s more than just a physical change. It’s a major philosophical change that I can’t help but find depressing and honestly, a huge turn-off.   
  
I feel like the walls are closing in. I’m dreading the conversation that will happen when my recent disinterest in intimacy is unavoidable, when my situation goes from “doesn’t really want to” to “cannot.” I worry it will damage our relationship and the vestiges of our sex life irreparably. While arousal on my end isn’t technically required for intimacy, I know she’s going to want to be with someone who reciprocates attraction (who wouldn’t?).   
  
But I’m really not interested in leaving. I love her, and the split could ruin our child \[5\]. I’m not interested in trying to convince her to change back. I’m just overwhelmed by the loss of an important part of our relationship, and most basically, I just miss my hot, chubby wife.   
  
\[TL;DR my heavier wife lost a lot of weight, I’m not at all attracted to smaller women, I’m worried about the imminent impact on our relationship\]

Before that i has a period of about six months where i was completely off the rails. That past year has been really good and i am succeeding both professionally and personally. Tonight, however, i suddenly realized that two summers ago i had e-sex with a couple of guys and i have no idea if they could have screen recorded it. It might be a slim chance but it still is a possibility that i can’t stop thinking about. I thankfully had an excel sheet of everyone i talked to that summer so i created a burner and messaged the guys anonymously. I don’t know if what i did was overkill or not but i couldn't stand the thought of me on a video somewhere. More than that, i cant believe that i was that reckless and stupid. I haven't felt this shitty mentally for at least a year, tonight i feel like i am a screwed up person who cant ever get anything right. I don’t want to be the person who made a dumb mistake when they were young, i can’t believe i almost threw my life away.

I met my now ex just at the end of 2022, it developed into a relationship mid-2023 for a few months and then broke apart because we both were not doing so great in the mental health department, and apparently I strained her so much at times, that she didn‘t want to continue (which I don‘t fully agree with, it‘s complicated, but I fully respect her decision if she felt that way). Well.., that being sad, I am constantly still thinking about her, and I miss the intimacy and love that she gave me during that time and the feeling to be there for her, which seems funny to me in retrospect, because I usually never was the type that wanted a relationship, and I just hooked up with girls whenever it seemed fit to me, but now I feel like I am missing something.. and also by now I have gotten a bit out of shape, and other circumstances happend in my life which are not beneficial to dating either, so I am a bit stuck at the moment. And at the of the day I would want to be back with her anyway, but I don‘t contact her anymore because I don‘t want to bother her, at the end we are on friendly terms, and still, I don‘t really know how to handle this situation",1713226120.0,
Cere_Bell_Umm,Too much happened today and I can’t handle it. ,0,1c51z3o,0,"For some background, my family is very, very complicated. My mom was raised by an extremely abusive and narcissistic mother, and refused to get herself help even though she and everyone around her knew she needed it. I got the brunt of her emotional abuse for my entire life, and although my dad used to stand up for me, he eventually chose her and their marriage over me. Him and I used to be best friends, and one day he had just told me he couldn’t defend me anymore because my mom was threatening divorce. In that single day I went from having one amazing person on my side to being completely alone in an emotional battlefield. 
A lot happened but the gist of it is that I cut them off because they accused me of being an addict and alcoholic which I’m not (they did this just because they found out I drank at college) and forced me to go to rehab TWICE, the second time for a YEAR. I officially cut them off towards the end of that second program and we haven’t been talking, though they’ve tried to reach out. Frankly, it’s too little too late. Until they get help and recognize their errors and admit to them instead of blaming me, I want no part of them.
Today was like my third day working front desk at this hotel, and it’s also new student day for a prominent college near the hotel. All day I watched supportive parents help their kids get set at orientation, so proud of them. Every person I checked in felt like a punch to the gut, reminding me that that should’ve been my life. I had gotten into an amazing school, but my parents pulled me out to send me to the first rehab. All I could think was that should’ve been me. I felt so angry and jealous all day. To top it off, I had to find out from my grandma on my dads side that my dad is in the hospital. I tried contacting him to find out why and got no answer, and my grandma was very mean about it. (She basically said “your dad is back in the hospital. I pray you care a little”) And FINALLY to top it off I posted some pics of myself to a modeling thread hoping for encouragement, and instead got told I’m delusional and not pretty enough. So yeah, not doing so well. I just feel sad and hollow. I don’t know what to do. If my dad died, there would be no hope of ever reconciling, but I can’t reconcile with someone who insists they’ve done nothing wrong. ",1713226112.0,

f4ndag0,I [18M] have gotten attached to somebody in one day,1,1c51oju,0,"Ever since I broke up with my ex, I felt very lonely and had no motivation, so I tried meeting new people online, after about a month of trying somebody finally answers one of my DMs.

It was this amazing girl, we had never talked before but I suddenly felt the spark, she looked very good and was extremely nice and sweet, we talked for a few hours and I completely fell in love with her, second day or conversation and I confessed how I loved her, and she reciprocated that, I felt so happy, I spent the night awake talking to her and hadn't slept in two days, I literally spent two whole days talking to her.
However, I noticed signs that she wasn't over her last ex, but I didn't want to care, I kept talking and felt like this was this love at first... message (?) thing, it was purely online but I completely fell in love, I was looking forward to talking with her today and I was completely addicted to the dopamine of seeing she finally answered me, it had been months since I didn't have any conversation like this with anybody.
Earlier today, she told me she wasn't over her ex, I told her it was okay and that we'll work on this, but then, she told me that she was already back with her cheating ex, I felt disgusting, betrayed once again, now I'm fighting to try and reach out to her, I told her to block me so I could heal by myself but I couldn't take the feeling of being lonely anymore.
I don't have many friend, and I don't see them often due to distance and everybody being busy, and being at home just sucks, even if it's for a couple hours, I like to have somebody to talk to even at home, my family doesn't like talking to me so it helps a ton to have that person online that answers my messages and that assurance that I always have somebody to talk to.
Now I feel sick, that pain in my chest just doesn't want to go away, as I am lonely again, I was for six month before that, after I broke up with my girlfriend of four years, before that i'd always have someone to talk to, even during the night, and I thought I would finally have that again.
TLDR: I was a rebound for three days despite me having fallen in love instantly with her, she's back with her ex, and I'm tired of being alone, if somebody wants to talk to me I'd love to chat and get to know each other, I know I sound crazy but I'm really desperate and need somebody to talk to.",1713225361.0,

wderedef,My girlfriend is not physically attracted to me anymore and it's killing me inside,0,1c51fh0,2,"She still loves me but she does not feel physical attraction to me anymore like she used to. I initiate almost anything like kisses, hugging, holding hands or anything intimate really and half of the time it feels like I just bother her. We have sex maybe once every 3 to 4 months.

I know i'm overly needy, but I've come to realize that she simply doesn't reciprocate these feelings anymore, also due to her being more honest about it in the past weeks, and it makes feel ill. I've been barely able to function anymore. I'm genuinly scared of losing my job because I spend the majority of my days thinking about her and being overcome by interchanging waves of gutwrenching sadness and daydreams about sex. I crave her touching me every day. I am more obsessed and in love with her than ever. I have also never been more emotionally confused.

The worst part is that it's probably my fault. I've gained weight. I've been lacking on dental hygien due to depression and had a bit of a problem with bad breath. I've become a more hectic and insecure person. She was always the most beautiful gorgeous girl i've ever seen and she was out of my league from the start but I've only turned more and more unattractive. I have also hurt her and broken her trust at the very start of our relationship and I can still feel the effects linger on her. I hate myself so much for it.

Call me stupid for having my whole life ruled by the whims of one person. But I cannot help it.

I don't want to continue feeling like this. But I also never want to lose her, she's mine. I think I would become suicidal if she was ever stolen away by someone she's genuinly attracted to while we're still in a relationship.  So i'll make her fall in love with me again. I'll lose the weight I gained. I'll take every measure I can to never have bad breath again. I'll do everything in my power to make her feel as treasured and good as she possibly can. I'm not going to be scared to tell her how I obsessed I am with her anymore.

Humble-Trash-8381,My dreams are so big it fucking hurts,1,1c4vqoh,0,"Idk how to start but imma j say it. I don't want to fucking compromise anymore. My mom died when I was 5 but never really felt her absence, missed her yes, because life was pretty decent had everything.

My father remarried and it was hell for me and my sister. It's been 7-8 years I've been suffering. She, fathers wife, always favours her daughter and she tries to steal whatever our privileges are. She's here for her daughters education and future then why doesn't she focus only on that. On the top of that my father and his wife have a 5yo daughter.
I don't hate her, I like her I want the best of her but that's really selfish on his part thinking of his future with his family while destroying ours.

If my grandparents wouldn't be alive today, they all including my immediate family members would've destroyed me and my sister by marrying us somewhere horrible.
To begin w my father was never like this. He was opposite of what he is today.

This lady came(from a poor family background) and she had a problem with how we eat, how our demands and wishes are fulfilled and how spoiled(in a good, mannered way) we were. 
Soon enough this man acted like he is a different family member like he has a whole goddamnnn family and me and my sister belonged to grandparents, who kinda raised us(i live in a joint family). 
Grandparents were fine but as soon as my uncle had 2 boys (5 and 3) they also changed and favoured them because 1.they didn't like my father as much as my uncle 2.and they were boys.

My father(second floor) pays for my school and other expenses excluding food in home. I eat at my grandparents(first floor(They also like taunted us almost everyday in covid because they had to support my uncle too and we were burden on them.
On that day, I was broken felt alone as ever. Cried alone, still am remembering it. That day, I knew who to rely on- no one but myself.
my fathers wife also suggested him that he should get me married and the married guy would pay for my education. Like I'm a fkn toy to sell. My father even asked my grandma for permission and at that time I knew nothing. It fcking broke me again and every day. 

My little sister (biological one)(not step sister not half sister) is protected because of me. I'm her shield and they know if I'd be married to a miserable guy id be over so would be my sister.

Cut to today. I have dreams istg I will die if I don't achieve them. That's the only thing which is keeping me going everyday. I want to study Computer Science and psych, conduct research , I want a phd and what not in The US bevause it's got resources. India, please don't try to convince me. Research is not respected, not paid enough. Whatever USA is my prefrence.
My father, if wants to, can pay my tuition fee in the US and I promised him to pay back Ion care I'll give it to him. But he's skeptical because apparently he has 4 kids THATS NOT MY FKIN PROBLEM, HE DIDN'T ASKED ME BEFORW MARRYING
and he's insisting ME to go to Germany because education is free.(hard for bachelor's) my dreams would be shattered. I then have to complete my cs only then get a job and then save. ITD BE FKN HARD TO DO MASTERS IN PSYCHOLOGY because of the curiculm. US allows a minor like they consider a minor for masters application.

I'll fucking cry. I want to study in US. There's alot to do. I'll grow alot which would not be possible in another country. Every other countries curiculm is diff. They don't allow you to explore.

My dreams are so big it fucking hurts.

Ms--Take,I hate the trans community as a trans woman,0,1c588zl,82,"Every time some transphobe makes an argument about gametes or chromosomes, there's always someone who comes in to argue ""well trans people aren't trying to change their sex, they're trying to change their gender and how they're perceived""

Those are one in the same for 99% of the human population. Gender exists as a direct outgrowth sex. All those bathrooms and lockerooms are seperated on the basis of sex, not pronouns or clothes and makeup. And as for me, I AM trying to change my sex, as much as medically possible. I want people to think I'm a cis woman when they look at me, because being perceived as anyrhing else makes me physically feel like I'm sinking in quicksand or a vat of syrup.

And then there's the gender dysphoria chestnut. Specifically, folks arguing you don't need dysphoria to be trans. Which makes about as much sense as arguing you don't need cancer cells to have cancer. Far as I'm concerned ""being trans"" is just the colloquial way of saying you have GD. If you don't have dysphoria, then why are you transitioning? And don't get me started on the people who basically don't except for names and pronouns, all the superficial shit that conveniently has no actual consequences. I don't know what they're going through (though I have my guesses), but it's clearly not the same thing and needs different terminology. 

And as to this umbrella community nonsense, I never signed up for that and I don't wanna be in a community with them. Why am I being associated with stereotypes about kids shitting in litter boxes. That's blatant fake news sure, but it also has nothing to do with me. Despite that, the laws against adult trans care absolutely will, but it won't do anything to these folks.

I know it may be my fault, I can’t talk to people and I’m really awkward but it’s not like they make it easy to be friends with someone, I see everyone having friends or just being able to do something easy as speaking to someone and I CANT

I’m not like them and I wish I was, they’re NORMAL and I’m not, I can’t do easy stuff like just asking for homework
 
I can’t ask someone to let me join in their group proyect because nobody wants to be with me, I hate it so much I hate it
There’s something wrong with me and I know there’s something wrong but I feel like I’m just saying that so I can have some type of justification about being the weird quiet kid that always ends up doing everything alone 

I don’t even know how to express how I’m feeling right know there’s so much stuff going on and me not being NORMAL it’s just fucking me up
There’s this big group proyect about a school play thing where you have to be in a team and you’ll do a play with them, I DONT HAVE A TEAM and nobody wants me in their team IM USEFUL ICAN HELP

I haven’t TRIED to join a group, but I just wish someone wanted me??? I’m not a bad student I could do all the work I just want a team I don’t care, if I ask someone to let me join they’ll just let me in for pity or because the teacher asked them to and that just hurts I feel pathetic
I just want to be normal and talk to people and exist I hate being like this so much

I know there’s people out there like me but it doesn’t matter because they’re not HERE, my mom isn’t like me and my sister isn’t like me, my teachers aren’t like me and nobody in my class is like me they can SPEAK they canTALK they aren’t so ODD or even if they are they atleast can PRETEND to be normal

I went for therapy like this because my mom this wasn’t normal that I’m not normal, the therapy didn’t help at all they just told me that I had a bunch of defense mechanism and that my old teacher probably is related to this, I always felt uncomfortable around the therapist and I hated that
I just WANT to be a normal kid with atleast ONE friend.

Ordinary_Client_4316,Found out my ex is engaged,1,1c50rir,2,"A couple of years ago I had a short but very intense relationship with someone. There was instant electricity the moment we met and I could talk to her like no other person. I've never felt so connected to someone and she said she felt the same way. Everything seemed to be going really well butt, I'll spare the details, some things went south in my life and things got a bit rocky and she eventually broke things off. We talked one more time and I just knew it was totally over and she was moving on (if she didn't already). 

I was tough to get over her, and took longer than I thought it would, but I did, or I thought I did. I found out recently through social media that she is engaged. When I found out, my first thought was, ""of course she is, she's a great catch"" but then I quickly become despondent and nonfunctional as all those feelings and emotions and memories came rushing back. I've told people in the past that she was ""the one who got away"" and, I guess, now I know for sure. Just to be clear, I was not under the delusion that we would get back together, I knew there was no chance of that happening, but just seeing that made me feel bad, and then I felt worse because I felt this way, if that makes sense. The best I can do is acknowledge it and put it behind me and that is why I am writing this post. I don't think this is anything I can talk to my friends or family about.",1713223008.0,

tacobellabean,Girl spread untrue rumors about me to my crush's girlfriend because she kissed the boy that I was talking to. My crush and friend cuts me off. Months later he finds out it was all a lie and my friend tells me he feels really bad.,1,1c50bo6,0,"Wild storytime.

So, this girl kisses the guy that I'm talking to (I didn't really mind, I didn't like him that much anyway) and she gets all nervous I guess because she doesn't want all the attention on herself for kissing the guy that I was talking to, she starts spreading rumors about me to the guy I actually like (My friend and former crush)

The rumor she spread was that me and him had kissed during our school's rival football game (mind you, this happened months after the football game). She even made fake text messages. She sends these rumors and the texts to his girlfriend and him. Mind you, I don't even know any of this is going on.  

He cuts me off, and says that he doesn't believe me. I'm okay with this, because if a friend who I've known for years cuts me off because of untrue rumors then fuck, well, they weren't really a friend anyway.

Fast forward to the present day, I'm doing just fine for myself. It was hard getting through that, always worried that this girl would keep spreading rumors about me and still dealing with my own shit. But I got through it, I'm better and more happy which is a really, really nice feeling.

I go to my friend's musical (We're all choir and theatre kids if that tells you anything about the drama) she's crew and I wanted to go to support her because she always goes to my stuff (and I haven't been going to her stuff because I know for a fact that he's probably going to be there and that his girlfriend and maybe even she (the girl who spread rumors about me) is also going to be there. But I decide to go anyway because, well, fuck them.

Then, all the sudden, she starts texting me out of the blue when I'm about ready to go to her musical and she texts about how my ex-crush and ex-friend told her that he feels really bad and is sorry and that he didn't believe a word of what my other ex-friend who spread the rumors about me said. She tells me of how he actually didn't believe the rumors at first but only cut me off because of his girlfriend.

My friend wants him to talk to me, but I don't even know what I'd say to him. I wanna make up with him at least just to rub it in rumor girl's face, but I don't think I can forgive him. I know why he did, but I still don't think I can forgive him for doing it and for making me think that he's thinks that I'm a bad person. ",1713221855.0,

I know people may not be in the best mental health. I've struggled to accept this, but I know now that that's just how life goes sometimes and I won't make someone feel bad for those things.

But I fucking hate that the most interaction I get from people I ""know"" or people I think I could be friends with is the occasional like or story view on social media, maybe a comment related to whatever content I post here and there. Never ""how are you? how have you been?"" and if I ask that instead, it's read and no response is sent, or a brief conversation ensues that fizzles out within a couple of messages. Trying to make new friends seems just as fucking impossible as trying to rekindle friendships with people I used to know, whether it be in person or online. It's possible there's something about me that turns people away, as much as I hate to think so. I wish I knew what it was.

I just want to feel a sense of community again. I want people to vent with, to laugh with, to listen to. I want to have meaningful conversations about mutual experiences and interests. I want to make time to spend time with them and vice versa. I want the platonic love and respect I have for others reciprocated.

aylaskkye,I have no freedom - My parents don't allow me to do anything as an adult,1,1c504gw,2,"Made an account just for this. I want to preface, as a religious Muslim, I do love the religion and everything but honestly this is driving me insane.

I'm almost 19, I'm a female from the UK. I'm Asian but my parents are born in England and so they're not very cultural. But to me they feel extremely religious and strict and I desperately need some second opinions.

I've had tension with them for the last 10 years, and I can't understand why I get so little freedom. My parents wanted 0 influence on us, so me and my siblings were homeschooled, and growing up we weren't allowed friends even within the muslim community. We rarely got to go to family events in case there was any ""bad influence"" so we always missed out since the rest of our family isn't as religious. It was very lonely honestly.

Our internet was limited to only sites we could study on and we weren't allowed to watch movies or shows. If my Dad ever found out we had any social media or online friends we were grounded for months. I was only allowed my first phone at 17.

Everything is off limits when it comes to going out alone. As an Adult the only place I get permission to go to is to work and back. I want to spend some of my money on good and productive things to do to help improve my mental health because I struggle with some trauma and depression from some past situations I went through, but I'm not allowed to leave the house to do them. Despite them not being sinful things or sinful places. I also want to travel someday but I've never even left the house alone yet.

I want to try and move out but my parents won't let me do that either and I think I will be disowned. I found someone online that I'm considering eventually moving out with, but it's not the safest option. I think it's all I have though, because living my life in one room, doing absolutely nothing I want to do and can afford to do, is hurting me. I've wished and asked for something different for the last 10 years and I can't wait anymore. Am I being dramatic? 😭

I'm not even trying to do any sin or break their trust, I just want to do normal every day things, at reasonable times, in safe places. And they said eventually as an earning adult I could live freely and I held so much hope for it. But now they don't want to trust me or allow me to live my life. Its really hard to think I will have to let them go, and maybe I shouldn't. But sometimes this whole dilemma makes me dislike the religion I love so much because their excuses root from it. Our religion is not supposed to be used to control others. Or is this normal for parents to do?",1713221345.0,
Nice_Rabbit4242,Is this a valid reason to end things with me?,0,1c4zuyd,0,"i (f22) used to exclusively talk to this guy (let's call him adam, m21) for like a few months or so, then we ended the romantic part of our relationship, switched to fwb on and off. 

i met him in late december, and we stopped in early february. the reason we had stopped is because i graduate university soon, and i intend on moving to asia after graduating, and that kind of long distance, 12-14 hr time gap, is not an easy one. and since then idk, i kind of just watched him deteriorate a little. he met this girl (f18) and they saw each other romantically for like a month but she would constantly cheat on him, berate him for having friends that were women, etc.- adam and i have become pretty close friends so it was hurtful to see. additionally, since meeting her, his drug substance increased exponentially, he stopped going to the gym, and he was being really hurtful not only to me, but to his other best friends also. from early-ish march until quite literally yesterday, he would manipulate us, lie to us, etc. and he's honestly quite good at it. i do know when im being manipulated but i tend to lack the backbone to do anything about it, but that's on me. 

yesterday, he took shrooms and had like a really bad trip at first, so he asked me to be there for him, which i was. then he burst into tears, and started talking about how he's been becoming a bad person and he sees that himself. he self diagnoses himself as schizoaffective and narcissistic, and he already has been diagnosed as depressed. he was always on dating apps (which is how he and i met) and he said that he would view those women as people to manipulate because it's easy for him, because he's so good at it. adam then looks at me and went, ""**the reason i ended things with you was not because you were going to asia, but because i didn't want to ruin you. i didn't want to corrupt you or hurt you.** you're so pure and innocent, i don't want to ruin that and hurt you."" 

(the pure and innocent thing, it sounds so weird when i say it about myself i promise im not conceited or arrogant or selfish so i'll just say things that i've been told 😭😭 i'm very unassuming, i love people genuinely, im naive, clueless, a bit ignorant in things with sexual connotations, know next to nothing about drugs, have no ""agenda"" \*idk what he meant by agenda\* when i meet people, etc. it goes on) 

the result of his trip and his epiphany was that he wants to clean up his act, so start going to the gym again, dispose of all of his drugs, and he even had me delete his dating apps & set up a password on his phone to disable the app store. 

but idk i'm just a bit disappointed? i thought he and i would make a pretty good couple and i thought it was like, a ""can't be helped"" situation, but to hear that he would've been willing to try long distance with me and make it work, but for it to have been a completely different reason he ended things was a bit idk.. iffy? to hear.

Basically the people i’m close to keep dying. It started with my sister, who died when she was 16 and i was 11 due to a car accident. It was awful living in the house without her in it, and i didn’t know how to talk with my parents for a long time. I also felt pretty bad at school because everyone knew about it, but even that’s wrong because it was my sister who died,i shouldn’t be annoyed at the consequences.

Then two years ago my mother died. I don’t know how she died really, i was too scared to talk to my dad about it and it was an unexpected thing. But i was still forced to just go back to school like nothing happened, but at least no one knows this time

Now in February one of my dog died unexpectedly of a liver failure, he was quite young and i was really connected with him.

And just tonight my other dog died right in front of me. I just feel like i’m being punished for something, but for the life of me I don’t think i’ve ever done anything to deserve this. The two dogs were the only connection i still had to my mother and sister and now they are gone.
I have no clue how to even go downstairs now without the dogs as a buffer between me and my dad, in order to just not awkwardly sit in silence.

I also apologize if my format is shit or confusing but this is how my brain works. I don’t expect anything to come from this post, I just need to get it out. 

As the title states, I feel like I’m approaching my breaking point and feel like there are no solutions available. 

1 - We (my wife, baby and I) have to move 

2 - I have been a shit employee 

3 - I am a recovering addict and relapsed months before getting to 10 years clean 

4 - I was diagnosed with ADHD at 12 but only recently sought medication and it’s not working 

——

1 - My wife and I moved to our version of paradise 3 years ago. At the time we were engaged but had decided that having children wasn’t for us, it’s not that we didn’t want to but due to hereditary issues with addiction & mental health in both our families and a world we struggle to understand or feel like we fit into we decided it would most likely be better to avoid having kids. We live in a remote town of 150 people surrounded by mountains, have a river that flows through our property and get to experience the best of all 4 seasons. We’re surrounded by hiking trails, lakes, amazing fishing and solitude. 

My wife was on birth control, Nuva Ring, and followed the instructions but because our minds were made up on children I was researching and about to schedule a vasectomy when we found out she was pregnant. We’re very much pro-choice and made the choice to have the baby because I think we both subconsciously questioned whether or not we were okay with not having a family. 

Being in a small, remote town there is no childcare available. We thought we may be able to be our own childcare as we both work remotely but as time went on we realized it wasn’t feasible without one of us quitting our job which would put a financial strain on us that we’re not comfortable with. We are hours from any family so they can’t help either. Now we have to leave the place where we both saw ourselves taking our last breath, where we can’t wait to return to every time we leave and where we grew even closer together. 

Add in the challenge of spending all day, every day juggling working with caring for a child who’s now mobile and needs as much attention and interaction as possible, by the time she goes to sleep we are tapped out. 


2 - I have what I believe to be a fantastic job for a fantastic company. I have never been a perfect employee but I do love working hard and benefiting from that work financially. Ever since our baby was born I’ve struggled to focus on my work, I never have enough time to do what I need to do and I have become trapped by anxiety over the thought of losing my job. 

Every time I get an email, call or text from my bosses I am convinced it’s a termination notice. I know what my capabilities are and I haven’t been even remotely close to them. It keeps me up at night, every night for months now. 


3 - In 2014 it finally became abundantly clear that I was an addict that needed to change. I got clean with the help of a 12 step program that, over time, I came to realize isn’t for me. Due to the stressors I’ve already mentioned I sought any form of relief I could find without using and one of the things I found that helped was CBD. Initially I was vigilant about making sure it was free of any THC but over time that vigilance broke down and I found myself using some of the most concentrated THC available, rosin. 

I stopped over 2 months ago and I’m not nearly as much of a train wreck as I was but I’m still struggling every day. It doesn’t help that I’m the only member of my family (mom, dad, sister) that doesn’t use daily. My dad caught me smoking weed when I was a teenager and my punishment was an hour long talk about how he wished he’d never smoked weed in his life followed immediately by the first time we smoked weed together. With a family of functioning users it’s made me feel unbelievably inadequate or like if I was normal I’d be able to smoke weed without it impacting the rest of my life negatively. 


4 - My parents didn’t medicate me for adhd as a child because my dad had recently been diagnosed with bipolar and the psychiatrist told them adhd medication would make me bipolar. I’ve always struggled with my symptoms but it seems like they’ve increased exponentially over the last several years. 

I finally tried medication, a non-stimulant due to my substance abuse issues, and it seemed like it could help initially but over time it seems like my symptoms are only getting worse. 


——

I feel like in the span of just over a year my entire world has been turned upside down and is at risk of crumbling entirely. Due to my adhd and struggles with addiction my internal dialogue has been aggressively negative for as long as I can remember. Between getting clean and last year I’d learned a lot about how to quiet that voice down or counter it but after relapsing and getting clean again I either don’t remember or am incapable of using the same strategies I used to so my dialogue has never been more negative. 

I’ve been in therapy for a year now because even prior to relapsing my thinking was getting increasingly negative but feel like everything I’ve gained vanished when I used. 

Every day feels worse than the one before it, I feel like I’m at war with myself about myself every single day and I’m not sure what will happen if the war doesn’t end soon. I can’t get out of my head, I have a physical reaction when I try to think positively and I know that all of this is incredibly difficult for my wife to watch because she’s struggling with her own challenges too. 

I’ve left out so many details for the sake of trying to keep this within the character limits and because these are the most impactful presently. However I’d like to make one thing abundantly clear, I love my daughter more than I thought I could love. I haven’t regretted having her for even one moment and if I could go back in time I wouldn’t change anything. ",1713219978.0,
zaimahk,i don't think i can do this anymore,1,1c4zhfj,1,"TW: self harm, suicide, rape, drug abuse

this will probably be a long post. im sorry for the absolutely terrible vibes im gonna be emanating in this post. but i need someone to hear me and i think my friends and family are truly sick of hearing the same thing time and time again. 

i am chronically ill. doctors say it's IBS, but that's just a catch all term for general GI issues. i have been living in a purgatory since i was 14 years old, after moving to england. i was heavily bullied, targeted, physically assaulted and threatened nearly everyday. within 2 months of joining my new school i developed my illness. on top of this, my parents had practically chained me to my room and the two years from then were the most abusive people i had ever known. they didn't understand what i was going through, and why i started lashing out and rebelling. i was just trying to escape the total hell i was enduring everyday at school, and instead of coming home to peace, i was screamed at, cursed at, locked in rooms closing my ears while my dad yelled at me about everything that was wrong with me. i was absolutely trapped and seeked validation in a 19 year old when i was 15. so, essentially, i was raped multiple times over the course of a year by this man under the guise of a ""fuckbuddy"" relationship. throughout all of this, my IBS was ""developing"", i guess? symptoms changed a lot during this time, from diarrhoea to constipation to both. anxiety triggered it the worst at the start until it eventually became my new norm. i was going to the bathroom up to 12x a day - doctors fed me laxatives and basically just said yeah, you probably have IBS. school was already terrible and with my new condition became practically impossible. i didn't tell anyone because i knew i would get bullied harder for it.

fast forward to now, 7 years later. i am 21 years old and have tried every supplement, every remedy, every alternative healing i could have thought up. my life is a living hell. i have recently drawn links between my symptoms and endometriosis, but diagnosis and surgery cost £10,000 and have about a five year wait through the nhs. i have considered having sex for money but hilariously i have seen that you need MULTIPLE surgeries to keep endo at bay, a lot of patients have in fact gone right back to square one inside of a year post-op. so the only solution is to be absolutely stinking fucking rich to be better if it does end up being endo. but the IBS seems far too closely related to my traumas, so i guess chances are high that i have both. double yay. i dabble in manifestation since randomly coming across the law at 18 and started doodling pictures of me and my sp and seeing them come true. since then, i've manifested a lot; love, money, friends, a kinder and more forgiving family. and i still have absolutely fucking nothing to show for it because without health, i am dust. i spend day in and day out in my room, pacing while drinking hot water, vaping extensively and holding my pee until i literally feel like im about to piss myself (i have before) to be able to trigger a BM (because for some reason my body literally does not know how to contract shits anymore) . i don't have a a job, had to drop out of university, starve myself to be able to go anywhere or do any kind of work. i can't even shower or nap when i want because they constipate me more. i eat about 10% of what normal people eat. right now, im living on eggs. literally just eggs. no alcohol, no holidays, no long road trips, no going out for lunches or dinners, i have to plan extensively before leaving the house for even 2 hours. i live on imodium and it only barely helps me. i am NEVER comfortable. i genuinely can't remember the last time i was. the best part is i can't even see the sun, because my illness is daytime dominant. i can't really remember the last time i went for a walk, or had a picnic, or gone on a hangout before 9pm. i lose a lot of sleep because i spend half my fucking life in that damn toilet, and only mine, because i apparently can't shit at all without a stool with me and im sure as shit not about to carry that shit everywhere i go. i get about 4 hours to myself at the end of the day if i am lucky where i can actually sit down and do what i want/need. doctors are sick of hearing from me and look at me like im stupid, my family still can't quite grasp just how severe my intolerances are and try to feed me things i can't have, people get annoyed at me for cancelling last minute or never coming out. 

right now, im tired. i started this journey with a lot of hope in me because i thought i would be better by now, i had a lot of visions and dreams for the future despite my illness. but every year i get a little closer to realising just how unattainable a normal life is for me. and every year a little more light leaves my eyes. i have been dreaming about the day i have the balls in me to end it, because this isn't a life. i don't know what i did in my past lives to deserve this level of torture. my ex boyfriend always told me at least i have looks but what the fuck is that gonna do for me if no one ever gets to see my face? i think about cutting myself to resist the urges and distract me from the thoughts, but i love my body and don't wanna scar my beautiful wrists that did nothing to me.

the saddest fucking part is, i saw so much potential in me. ive been a singer since 10, ive written about 100 songs, i couldnt be happier with the face and body that were gifted to me, i have always been highly charismatic and social and loved being surrounded by people. now i am an absolute shell of a human being. i practically drag myself through each day. i don't have hobbies, can't keep up with basic personal hygiene. i haven't done my laundry in months. i do drugs to cope because when my thoughts are bare all i can think about is reaching for a knife.

anyways, im tired. if anyone actually cared enough to read this far, you are kinder than most of the people in my life. not that i blame them for not wanting a cripplingly depressed person to bring down the mood at every given opportunity. thank you for listening.",1713219716.0,
Asleep_Mail5503,a compliment that is gonna stick with me for the rest of my life,7,1c4k0d1,2,"i really wanted to share this moment but it feels really up my own arse to tell anyone irl 

yesterday, my mate at uni was talking to me drunk in the pub about how my passion for understanding everything around me, and especially how we talk about history (our degree) is really inspiring. it makes her want to have the same energy, and when we study together, we tend to talk for hours about the different meanings and understandings and go on to a million different topics and its always the absolute best time. 

it really meant a lot to me to hear her say that, and she said i’ve really made her think differently and opened her eyes and hearing that i had such a positive impact on her just by yapping about history really made me happy.

growing up, i was rejected a lot by the people around me because i like to have big deep conversations about life and about different historical or political things. now ive got someone who loves that about me, and finds it inspiring. it healed a part of my soul. 

anyways, love you mg, you show me everyday that it is okay to be myself, and that the right and most beautiful friendships will come along when I am myself. ",1713181109.0,
tryingtotrytobe,Lying Too Much,1,1c4z6bg,0,"The father of my child lies so much and it makes it really difficult to survive the coparent relationship. 
An example would be that he wasn’t giving her a prescribed medication. When I found out, he only admitted to missing some doses but my child said the medicine didnt even exist at his house. The point is that he admitted missing it (in writing) at a minimum however has since turned around and said I am lying and being slanderous. 
It goes on and on like this on numerous topics. Another example is that she has told me he has spanked her multiple times and he says it isnt true. I truly wonder if he is a pathological liar as I picked up this during our dating and marriage years as well. 
How do I survive this? Tips? Tricks?…anything?

opinionatedOptimist,Pregnancy Scare…,3,1c4q06y,2,"I know I’m likely in the clear, but this has been stressing me out. I had sex with a man with protection (a condom) and I’ve never had a pregnancy scare before now, but it popped into my head and has been causing me a lot of distress ever since. 

I haven’t told anyone but an online friend about it, but what upsets me most really is that I’ve come to realize that if it actually were real, I’d be entirely alone in dealing with it. Because… I would not keep the child. I’d always had mixed feelings about abortion until now because having this scare has made me realize how terrifying it is and why it should be an option. I can hardly financially support myself, nonetheless another human being. 

But… yeah, what upsets me most is that no one in my life would support me. I would have to go through that process alone and keep it to myself onward because my Mom would not support me and would be mad at me making that decision despite knowing me having a child would uproot everything for me in the worst way. 

It’s not even the pregnancy scare that has hit me so hard but the realization that the support in my life is conditional. It hurts me so much. I just wish I could cry to my Mom about it, but even knowing it’s just a scare, she’d likely call me selfish and cruel for not wanting a baby. 

But my anxiety has been amplified because since having this thought, my Mom told me yesterday that I looked bloated and “pregnant.” Which is mean in itself considering I just got out of residential eating disorder treatment. And she even told me she had a dream that I was pregnant this morning. My anxiety has been so high. She’s never had a dream like that about me before. Why is all this shit happening?? It makes me feel like somehow it’s true and it’s too early for me to even take a pregnancy test so I’m just sitting here crying. I feel so lonely and so confused. 

And the guy used a condom!! There’s probably nothing to worry about, but I’ve gone from being mildly anxious to terrified. 

I just want to get my period and not think about this anymore. I don’t know what to do. Especially since it’s likely not the case, but the anxiety is so real. I wish I could make it go away. 

Thanks for reading if you did… I’m just distraught.",1713197224.0,

N3O_23,My boyfriend ‘16M’ has consistently lied about his best friend ‘13F’.,1,1c4ywqp,2,"I 16F have a boyfriend 16M of almost one year. He has this best friend that is around 13 years old he’s known her since he was 4. In the beginning of the relationship I was told about the bsf this included that they usually go on walks together and that he sends X’s to her which I didn’t mind at all. My bf started to mention her a lot to me in the weeks following the initial talk about her when he was talking about her I became quite aware of some of her behaviour towards him they seemed more along the lines of someone that had a crush. I mentioned it to my boyfriend and told him I didn’t want him to cut her off but I wanted him to be aware so he could stop it if it went too far. A few weeks after my boyfriend had asked whether it was okay for him to go on a walk with her I said it was okay and he didn’t need to ask but I would prefer if he told me that he was going with her before he did just so I knew. After that day she started distancing herself until a while later when she needed help from him because she was having trouble with friends during that time my boyfriend was constantly on his phone around me without mentioning she needed help. Eventually I got annoyed and told him to please stop going on his phone as much around me because he was making me feel like he didn’t want me there so he did. One night after this my boyfriend got a message from her complaining about the fact he didn’t have time for her anymore and that she didn’t want to be someone he talked to for fun which caused him to have an extreme reaction mentioning sh and self unaliving. I had argued with her that day mentioning that he had done everything in his power to be there for her and the she just wasn’t respecting the relationship with the way she was acting. After this point contact between me and her has been completely cut I told him that what he does with her now is not my business abut I’d like to be told if he speaks to her again. They stopped talking for a while to my knowledge she texted him a couple months after and they started talking again behind my back. When I did notice that he was talking with a girl I asked him about it and he had told me she was a friend online that he went to if he had some issues which as far as I knew was valid because he has her in his phone as ‘idiot.’ I called him out on that lie a while after under the pretext that he was texting her way to much for her to be just that to which he then told me it was a lesbian from his kick-boxing (the bsf is fully straight but does attend kick-boxing with him). After a while I caught on that he was lying so I asked whether he’d lied to me about ‘idiot’ to which he broke down and told me that it was in fact the bsf. We worked through that with the conditions he sorts out his priorities and doesn’t lie to me even if he thinks it’s going to hurt me. Now to yesterday she posts on her Instagram story (she followed me before we got in the argument and we just never removed each other) it was a photos of him and her. I got upset and asked him about it in admittedly not the nicest way to which he told me that he went on a walk with her alone yesterday after spending the night over mine and repeatedly telling me that he was going alone although he knew for two days that he was going on a walk with her. I don’t know how to move forward in this relationship now because he’s just not following boundaries I set when it comes to her. Apart from her he’s a picture perfect boyfriend but I can’t get over the fact that they look like a couple in the photo, that it was put up with the clear intent of me seeing and that he lied to me and snuck around with her again. Am I being controlling or over reacting to the situation? I know she’s young and he most likely wouldn’t cheat but I’m doubting everything about myself and the relationship right now I could just use a little advice. Thanks and sorry for the long post.

Bittle_Loobs,Why does this nightmare keep accruing?,1,1c4yves,0,"I had another nightmare around the early hours of the morning again, that was the exact same nightmare the night before.

Again, woke up disoriented, hyperventilating, and then crying uncontrollably. 

It feels like I haven't slept much at all and my eyes are puffy from crying. 

I wish my nightmares were about something else, like ghosts, zombies, vampires, demons, home invasions, aliens, anything else. But the problem is... nothing scares me like that anymore after what I've been through. Paranormal activities and aliens used to be my worst fears, but now it's not. 

The nightmares always start off being stuck staying with one of my parents or a fun, awesome dream starts fading into a scene of being stuck staying with one of my parents. Then all of a sudden I feel really depressed and feeling confused. Wondering around my mom's or at my dad's house (they are divorced by the way), and both my parents would be talking to eachother in low voices and looking concerned. 

Then I would be on my phone and feeling a massive wave of anxiety. I can't find my boyfriend's phone number, and I can't find him on Facebook? I would try to type his phone number, obviously to try and contact him, but my phone would do weird stuff or I end up not remembering his phone number. 

I would somehow manage to contact a couple of his family members, but they wouldn't give me any clear answers or tell me ""I don't know."" I can't remember what I was asking of them about my boyfriend?

Feeling overwhelmed, I would start crying and yelling at my parents ""what's going on? Why am I here? I am suppose to be with *boyfriend's name* and why don't I have him in my contacts and on Facebook?!"" My parents would just stare at me confused, and would answer me stuff that I don't want to hear.

Then everything just turns into third person and I am looking down on myself. The nightmare just turns into my pasts memories of what happened 4 months ago. I would be wearing the exact same outfit, looking thin and ill looking. Yelling nonsense at my parents, begging to be with my boyfriend, and I can feel this awful sick feeling in my gut and my heart would feel very sore. Then I would wake up.

My boyfriend obviously wakes up to me, and tries to comfort me. He's tried asking about the nightmare I had yesterday when it first happened, but I refuse to tell him. Maybe it's a sign I need to talk to him, and tell him of my nightmare that I keep having, as it's happened more than twice now, just not twice in a row like this. I'm still very raw from what happened a few months ago. 

I don't communicate about how I am feeling because I feel like I'm being a burden. My boyfriend works really hard and at the moment, he's suffering with back problems again. He's got enough on his plate. But I still feel very hurt, everytime I feel like I really do need to have a conversation with him, I just end up not bothering and sometimes I drink to shut up my thoughts and feelings, which I know I can't keep doing. 

I really don't know what to do. I've kept my mind busy all day, and in the mornings, I've been doing intense workouts and going for a run too. I don't want to speak to anyone about how I'm feeling, not after what I've experienced, and I don't feel like my feelings are validated. Which is typical because I would sit there listening to all their problems and feelings. I'm always careful with what I say as well. If I speak to a counselor or a therapist, they'll just tell the same stuff I know what I need to do. For one ""communication"" with your partner and your family. Yes, I already know that, why don't you tell them that?

Pretend_Ad_8806,My boyfriend can never say good things about me,5,1c4kdzh,4,"My boyfriend of 6 months generally always does nice things for me, but his words are quite different.

We goof around a lot and have cute nicknames - we can get through most of the time not talking about anything serious.

But when I ask him why he likes me etc, he gets annoyed and says he doesn't need to give me a list. However, he is quick to call me things like narrow-minded, biased, naive when we talk about topics like migration and defense. When discussing Gaza this morning he called me all those things - despite the fact that I have a master's degree in humanitarian law and the law of armed force. When I kept it very objective and calm, told him all my legal and practical points, he said well you spend all your time reading about Gaza you don't care about other situations in the world.

I feel like he had contempt for me. I feel like we joke around and are playful and physically affectionate, but when we discuss our real opinions and views, he just criticises me. There are no moments of tenderness to counterbalance this - where he says, you're so thoughtful, kind, caring, whatever. In fairness, I am disappointed he openly said he's not concerned about people in other countries who are suffering - and he dislikes the fact that I do care, because it makes me ""naive"".

I basically feel like all the things my friends and family like about me, and that I like about myself, he looks at with an eye roll. It's too easy to keep continuing our relationship since we joke around and can avoid these serious discussions, but how can I really know whether he loves anything real about me.",1713182360.0,

Both of my parents talked about it and decided to be together, although my mom is not the same anymore and it seems that my father try to act like nothing happened. What hurt us more was that my father used to find us annoying, talked about how his life was so hard on him but he had no other option (he used to told me that a lot when I was a child) and just prefer being on his cellphone than talk to us...he never had time for us, but plenty of time for that woman.

I know that my parents already sorted somethings out but a part of me is tired of him, my brother was already distant with him so is not so different from before, but he just try to be close to me and I'm not capable of that, since he is the kind of person who prefer to avoid the problem, for us as his son and daughter is important and necessary that he apologize, we know that the cheated one was my mom, but we feel betrayed, our father used to judge us for everything, like being the max authority of the morals....he knows that we had a pending chat but he prefer to avoid it.

Known_Researcher59,Caught my wife sexting don’t know what to do ,637,1c3q3rg,372,"Caught my wife sexting

Me (29M) just caught my wife (29F) sexting some guy. She went off to say how she was sad she didn’t get to have sex with and send him a video of her face blurred out but her showing off her naked body.  The way I stumbled across these messages was after taking her out for her birthday I asked to see her phone as I had no signal and she quickly went to her messages and made it seem like she was “cleaning up her message as it “slows” down her phone” weird I thought but I’ve been with her for  6 years now married for 5 months and she’s never done anything to break my trust however then after I got the phone it locked and I tired to enter her passcode but she changed it? 

    She said she changed it because we were going out and she want to be prepared? Just incase she lost her phone so people couldn’t access it but I thought how would they know your passcode? So I dropped it and once we got home something was nagging me and told me to check her phone and recover the deleted messages and that’s when I found them. She had the name as one of her childhood friends so I wouldn’t read it and one I opened it I was welcome by my wife’s naked body in a video for a guy to cum too.

          Admittedly I was furious as I just took her out for her birthday, been working extremely hard to get a raise in hopes to buy us a home so I woke her up and had her phone in her face asking whats going on. She said she didn’t know what I was talking about and after that didn’t work she said they never met and it was just some random guy who reached out to her and showed interest to her… now my wife isn’t slim but I love her and make sure she feels attractive and I don’t know if this attention got her to make this decision? 

           She is telling me that they never met and she would never go through with it but how can I trust her? In our marriage prep class through our church the subject of infidelity came up and she said that it was a deal breaker that their was never a way to fix it and was very adamant but then goes and does this? I’m so lost in what to do I spent 6 years with this person living our life and traveling the world together and right when I thought we were moving on to our next chapter together of getting a home and trying for a child which we have had a hard time on a count of her type 2 diabetes but she has gotten her levels in a range she doesn’t need meds. 


     I told her to leave and go to her dads and everything in me is saying to annual our marriage I’m humiliated honestly and I feel like less of a man now that my wife would do this to me but then I remember all of these amazing memories we have together and how she is my best friend and I love her but can I ever hope to repair this relationship? We married under god and I truly thought she was my soul mate and she said she still loves me and it was a mistake but why would you ever hurt your life partner? Your best friend? I’m just lost and at the end of my lonely night I just find myself fighting the urge to call her 

TLDR-wife was acting funny about her phone I decided to snoop while she was asleep and discovered she was sexting some guy and send him a video and unsure if I should even try to save my marriage or call it quits


***UPDATE***
I spoke with her and she agreed to delete all social media get into therapy for her depression and we have a meeting with the father of our church and hope to get counseling to save this marriage. I had her come over and I gave us each a piece of paper to write things we love about each other and what we don’t. Admittedly I haven’t always been there for her as far as reassurance and with us failing to conceive and herself low self esteem she did show a moment of weakness I’m just disappointed she didn’t seek comfort in her husband.

And I have had 2 other long time realitionships about 2 years or a bit less with attractive women. So am I really that ugly? Because I don’t feel like I am. Maybe I have some characteristics that not many have. Like a hooked nose it’s not wide but kinda long and a little bit of underbite. But I look kinda attractive maybe a bit average when I look at myself in the mirror. So the big question is why do people, my friends keep telling me I’m ugly and one stranger too in my life. Am I???

Abyssalore24,NSFW: My attempts at intimacy have been viewed as harassment by my GF.,1,1c4x8ls,1,"So my GF was telling me about how she recently just woke up from her nap that ended abruptly because she was being harassed in her dream. I asked her if she remembered what happened and if she wanted to talk about it. 

She prefaced it ahead of time that her dream involved things that I do that she doesn't like and she then described how one of the men in her dream grabbed her boob randomly and caressed it and would not stop, while another man (not specifically in the same instance) hugged her from behind and tried to whisper something into her ear but she could indeed feel something poking at her lower back/butt coming from the man hugging her. 

I feel horrible because these are the exact things that I did during our most recent vacation with each other where I did both. The former led to sex while the latter didn't (we were both tired that time).

so he (dumper) reached out about 2 weeks ago, only to ask ""how im doing"". i told him im doing okay and currently im in therapy and on meds. i also asked for his intentions, he texted back he had none, he just texted to know how im coping and also the ease his guilt. i responded i don't wish for him to contact me unless it's about reconciliation, otherwise it affects my healing process, he texted back he didn't realize the consequences of him texting me and since that moment he's gone again.

im lost, i belive his intentions were pure and he didn't want to mess with my mind, although i found it a little bit selfish that he reached out and for what? did he expect i was already moved on? (we have been 2 months into NC at that very moment)
i felt guilty that i didn't ask him how is he doing but i was afraid im gonna hear that he's dating someone else etc, even though i wish him well.

RAthrowaway98989,My fiance deeply traumatized a girl and I helped.,0,1c5r0xk,79,"I met my fiance when we were in middle school. We didn't start dating til late high school. And didn't get engaged until last year when we graduated college. We've been together now for a little over 7 years.  
A couple of weeks into our freshman year of high school, a new girl transferred to our school it was a big deal since we went to a small rural school. She was from another state and her dad had just gotten a job nearby. She was and still is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. Even in her awkward early high school years, she was stunning. Everything about her was perfect she looked like a walking painting, like someone had brought a Barbie to life. To this day she still looks like a goddess.

  
Not only was She beautiful on the outside she was also an incredibly kind and genuine person. She'd go out of her way to be kind to everyone even if they had hurt her. She hated saying anything mean or rude. Like to the point she had cried once because she had honked at someone for cutting her off and almost hitting her car. She was so trusting and sweet. She was also incredibly smart and well-spoken.  
I was always so jealous of her. I think I still am. Of course, being the person she was she and I became friends. We were close for a while. But I let my jealousy of her get the best of me when a boy I had liked asked her on a date during our junior year. At that point, I pulled away from her. I had begun dating my fiance and actively ignoring her efforts to talk to me. It was classic mean-girl behavior.  
At the beginning of our senior year of high school. I heard a rumor that she and my Fiance had hooked up with each other at a party.

  
Enraged I asked all my friends about it and my Fiance. My friends showed me their ""evidence"" which was a photo of the two sitting next to each other and another photo of my fiance pouring her drinks. My fiance denied it at first. Then told me that She had thrown herself at him and begged him to sleep with her and he was high so he hooked up with her. He apologized over and over and begged me to believe it was a mistake and he will never do it again.

  
So I believed him and stayed with him. And I dedicated the rest of my time in high school and a part of my freshman year of college to telling everyone she was every horrible name I could think of. As word spread the more dramatized the story became. It got to the point where nobody from our high school would associate with her. Even adults in our small town made nasty remarks about her when they saw her in public. She couldn't go anywhere without someone saying something. I was even proud of myself for getting her kicked out of the high school's cheer team for not upholding the school's values. I remember her face after that she had this look on her face of utter and complete betrayal.  
And throughout all of this, She was still gracious and kind. She walked around with her head held high. She wasn't this unreachable goddess to anyone anymore. There were cracks; visible ones that we all saw. But she never let anyone see that they had gotten under her skin. She was clearly affected by my actions but at the same time was still so kind towards me.  She tried to reach out to me to explain what happened but I ignored her.

  
It's been years later now. Nobody really talks about her anymore. She had moved away for college and never came back. I hadn't thought about her in years. Until last weekend at my bachelorette party. My maid of honor who is my close friend from high school brought her up. We all had a laugh about her and even looked through her social media accounts lightly joking about how she looks, dresses, and acts.

  
One of my bridesmaids went to a neighboring high school but the same college as me. She leaned over my shoulders to see who we were talking about she said she remembered her being really nice and thought she still looked super pretty. My MOH asked her if she knew why everyone hated her. My bridesmaid said no and my MOH and I retold the story. As she listened her face went from confused to a look of absolute horror.

  
Bm asked if I knew the actual story of what happened that night at the party. I said no I just knew what I had been told. What BM told me made me sick to my stomach. The girl whom I had spent almost two years publically destroying, blaming her for my rocky relationship and future trust issues. Was a victim.  
Bm said my fiance was with friends who dared him to try and get with her. Being the friendly and somewhat naive person she was. She didn't think it was weird her friend's boyfriend wanted to hang out with her, she trusted him to pour her drinks, and she trusted him when he led her to the bathroom because she was too drunk to walk. Bm said she and her friends found her hours later passed out, half naked, and bleeding in a bathtub. BM said she then woke her up and she began crying in a way BM said she had never seen before and hasn't seen since. So she helped her get cleaned up and dressed then drove her home.

  
My fiance sexually assaulted a girl and I helped him ruin her life. I unknowingly got engaged to a man who hurt someone in a way I can never understand. I aided in deeply traumatizing a girl because I was jealous of her. I still am jealous of her. I'm still getting married my fiance wasn't the man he was in high school. But I can't get the image of her out of my head. I keep thinking about reaching out to her I don't think I will. From her social media pages, she looks happy and like she has a good life. My MOH and the BM told me to put it out of my mind. It was years ago and neither she nor I are the same person.

  
My fiance doesn't know that I know what happened. He seemed visibly uncomfortable when I told him her name came up at my party. There is no use dragging up past wounds but I feel so guilty for the part I played in it all.",1713300799.0,

Im chronicle ill, have couple things going with my body that make me suffer alot of pain everyday and makes my life harder, Im unable to work and probably will never be able to work.

He loves me no matter what, he been here when I got diagnosed with 2 more chronic illness and depression. He doesn't care that I can't work or atleast says so and would let me just stay at home with our relationship. 

We live in rather expensive country, high prices and taxes, I try to apply for goverment funds and early retirements so I wouldnt be that burden but its hard and Im ""too young to retire"" so my luck hasn't been that great. Many times our finances drops on his shoulders and he tries so hard. He is studying in University and doing some freelance stuff but basicly living off student loan.

He just wants me to be happy, I try to be for him and I try to burry my worries so he can focus on studies and other stuff, but I can't. 

He is young man, full of life and ambitious. Im pretty sure in future he will have great career that pays him well but I dont wanna be leach in his life. If I could just die he would have so much better life. He could find woman who isn't in pain all the time and who match with his ambitious life and they could have together financially secured life and so much nice things he deserves.

CreativeCar8847,Was I raped?,1,1c4wnqb,4,"Hello. Throwaway for obvious reasons. This has been eating away at me for 2 years now. I (18F) had a boyfriend two years ago, I was 16 at the time, as was he. I was over at his house after we celebrated his birthday. Nothing much was happening, but he escalated things and one thing led to another, he was on top of my trying to kiss me (ive never kissed someone else before, as well was a virgin). I moved my face away many times, whilst keeping a smile, I was shy, and I didn’t want to say no; I had a bad habit of being a people pleaser. After me moving my face over 5 times, he finally did it. After that was over, I tried to get some rest. I was shortly after awoken with his hand going down my pants, for some reason I didn’t stop him. He touched me for about 5 minutes, then started to undress me and insisted to penetrate. I was silent, but he kept asking over and over, I finally obliged, but it hurt, a lot. I was very dry, so it was not pleasurable at all. After a few minutes, I told him to stop, to which he did, but I felt so disgusting after the whole thing. I was hurting for days after that, to the point of tears. 

We were together for almost a year after that. After arguments, he’d initiate, I wasn’t comfortable, but again, I never said no to him. 

There were other times where he would want to record me, to which I’ve always said no to. One day he told me to blanket over my head, I had no idea why, I listened to him and after a few minutes , I heard his phone drop on the bed, and my heart dropped. After we finished I asked for he recorded me; he said yes.

Specialist-Ad6683,"Friend ruined our friendship because he wanted out of the ""friend zone""",2,1c4qtwm,2,"This is my first ever post and it's a super long one. So I'm sorry ahead of time.
Idk if this friend would even find this, but aw well if he does.

I (35F) had a friend (40M) who I had known for years. Let's call him Tom. I moved from one state to another and was with someone at the time as I met Tom.
After several years of knowing Tom I found that he is very irrational. When he's angry or upset he screams and yells and tends to make everyone around him be his verbal punching bag. When he's happy he's jumping for joy and excited like a child which seemed endearing at the time, but he was unpredictable and was an emotional roller coaster a majority of the time.
I always considered Tom a friend. I never thought of him as anything more. I never found him romantically or even sexually attractive.
He was going out of his way to buy expensive birthday gifts and Christmas gifts. One year at a place we both used to hang out at a lot, he bought everyone gifts and while everyone opened up one gift from him I opened 7 or 8 gifts that came from him. Again I just didn't think about that at the time. I was starting a new job, moving several times because my abusive ex was stalking me and following me everywhere I went. I just didn't think about dating as a whole let alone if someone liked me or not.
Also I'm a hugger/affectionate to all my friends if they like hugs/touching. He wanted a hug from me every time he saw me and I was happy to oblige my friend thinking nothing of it. He used to stay late outside my door with me and we'd talk for a while. Nothing about romance or a relationship. Just talked about normal stuff we talked about as friends do. Things like board games, cards games, life, etc.
One time Tom asked if we could hang out in my apartment alone. I again saw nothing wrong with it and invited him up. 
We hung out for a few hours and talked. We didn't do anything. I stayed on one end of my living room and he stayed on the opposite end. When I was tired and wanted to go to bed he was reluctant to leave and I didn't know why. He mentioned that he takes nightly walks and enjoys the night air and walks down my street as his regular route. I again thought nothing of it, still.
We have never kissed, held hands, or anything for him to incline that I felt any sort of way for him. We have hugged and talked. Nothing more and nothing less.

This is important.

My other friend, (24F), pointed out eventually that Tom and I should date. I was confused and asked why? He and I are just good friends. She pointed out the way he looks at me is so sweet.

Then it all clicked. 

I started panicking and shook my head profusely. She was confused and pointed out the gifts, the constant hugging and talking, the way he hugged me which was at the bottom of my hips, just above the rear end, and just how he looks at me. I told her, that we have never done anything except hang out as friends one time in my apartment. There was no romantic or sexual involvement as I believed he was just being a good friend.

When I finally realized everything I talked to him about it. He confessed his feelings and I let him down as gently as I could. That I've never seen him that way and he's always been a friend and never anything more to me. He asked me out on a date and politely declined. He asked to talk more about it and I told him no as there was nothing more to discuss.

Tom had feelings for me and I had nothing of the same to reciprocate, so why talk about it?
 
He started messaging me fb reels, TikToks, and the like that express undying love for someone, repeatedly. Confessing his love again to again be politely declined.
Whenever I rejected him he always clapped back with some unhinged backward compliments.
One such being ""You're just not used to be treated right."" another being ""You're just blind to me from your trauma."" And another being ""Chad (abusive ex) brought us together. If he wasn't around then we would have been together."" To finally ""You don't find me attractive because you're shallow and don't see my true worth.""
We fought constantly.
He would declare his love and I would ask him to stop. He kept buying gifts and I told him it was making me uncomfortable.

He continued.

He was on my other social media pages and seeing things I liked and shared. He would buy those things I liked/wanted and would give them to me.

He was digitally stalking me. 

Now the nightly walks made me terrified to leave the house. 
How many times was he at my door hoping I would open it and let him in?
How many times did he stay under my window so he could watch me?
I covered all my windows. 
It became a weekly routine where he confessed his love and I would reject him. He would make some mean comment towards me and I call him out on it. He would apologize and just say he loves me so much.

This man had me in tears every day because I didn't know how else to tell him. I didn't know how else to get him to understand that I cared for him as a friend only. 

I fought back because I wanted to save our friendship. I didn't block him because I foolishly believed that I could help him understand what I felt. 
But I realized that what I felt never mattered. What I wanted never mattered. What I was trying to do wasn't important to him.
I hooked up with someone else in between all this and they happened to leave a mark on a visible part of my body. Where we were at this interaction he knew I lived upstairs and heard my neighbor walking around in their own apartment as he saw the mark.
He was absolutely livid and comoletely betrayed. How dare I let another man, that isn't him, touch me? We fought the rest of the day.

Mind you all the fighting was through a messaging app and never in person. Every time we fought he would go to a mutual friend at their place of business and rant/yell about me for a couple hours then leave. Usually in front of mutual friends or customers.

The final straw was I finally just caved and played the devil's advocate. 

I put a scenario up to him:
That he won. I gave up fighting and just let him date me. Where he's on cloud 9 and I'm completely miserable and dead inside. Where no matter what he did. What he could say. He could never change what I felt. I would never love him the way he wanted me to love him. That he would try to change me and make me love him eventually. To then be angry that I don't love him. 
I asked Tom would he really want that!? 
Would he really want someone who doesn't love him?

He said was fine with that scenario.
As long as he had me he didn't care how.

I told him I was done and stopped responding.
I lost any and every emotional connection I had with him at that moment. He burned everything down because I wouldn't sleep with him. Because I wouldn't date him. Because I wouldn't reciprocate what I didn't feel.

He continued on sending the same messages of how much he loves me and how it hurts that I don't respond. No apologies from him. No accountability. 

Now whenever I see him it's just static. Like staring at the black and white jumble on an old TV that hisses, pops, and clicks.

I feel absolutely nothing for him.

I would go on to read his messages because I knew it hurt him to not respond. If I blocked him, then it would give him the excuse that he's such a nice guy that I'm such a horrible person to block such a good man.

He then complained to one of my friends who mentioned how he hates that I don't respond, so I stopped opening the messages.

He completely believes I have feelings for him that I've hidden away. He completely believes that I'm testing him or making him wait as some sort of punishment. That I'll regret when he stops caring for me, to then proclaim his love again.

I'm terrified he's going to show up at my door one day and I be the newest dateline sensation.

Weekly-Resolution-25,Struggling with guilt after reading dubious/violent erotica,1,1c4wk56,3,"Hi, I’m 19 years old and I’m really having difficulty with some stuff that happened a couple years ago. I was going through a very difficult period of time and for whatever reason became more interested in explicit (illustrated/written) material, possibly to distract myself. I accidentally stumbled upon a very scary, violent gangr*pe themed work and felt extremely uncomfortable/upset with the content but simultaneously attracted to it. I ended up consuming (and yes, occasionally mastubating) more written/drawn fiction with themes of nonconsent and feeling extremely guilty about it. I ended up nearly suicidal because I feared that it made me a terrible person, and because in real life I’m incredibly opposed to even the slightest violation of consent. I mostly stopped reading anything like that a while ago because I felt so uncomfortable, but the negative feelings didn’t go away.
I’ve read studies and articles on sexual fantasy, and while I now understand this is relatively common to find attractive in some way, I can’t help but feel disgusted by myself and worried that something might be wrong with me. I worry that other people might think that as well, I’ve seen people who say anyone who’s interested in this stuff is disgusting. I feel so terrible that I did this in the first place, and every time I’m reminded of how horrible this stuff is irl I feel guilty, especially towards real victims. I worry that if I stop feeling guilty it’ll prove somehow that I really am terrible. Sometimes I even fear that I’ve doomed myself to being miserable forever.

I’ve had issues around interest in stuff like this for a long time, and a lot of sexual shame. I don’t know how to work past this and sometimes feel like I don’t even deserve to. is there anything I can do to feel less horrible about this?",1713212722.0,
Lilyjokester,I smoked a lot of meth today and I’m having bad anxiety 20f,1,1c4wg24,0,"Idk how to start this so I’m gonna keep it simple.
I have this friend named cade (fake name) and she pressured me into smoking meth with her and her boyfriend.
Cade (20f) and I had a falling out after 2 years of friendship because of her new boyfriend (22m) who’s a meth and fentanyl addict talked hella shit to me and blah blah blah. Fast forward me and cade make up and I go to hang out with her and her boyfriend because I was lonely and my boyfriend and I were fighting. And cade starts suggesting doing meth with her, and I’m shocked that she would even suggest such a thing because she doesn’t even smoke weed and she’s scared of most drugs. I on the other hand have had my fair share, I’ve done molly, Coke, ecstasy, acid, shrooms, perc 30s (which is basically just fentanyl) and I’ve even done meth once while blackout drunk but I didn’t count it because I was too drunk to remember.
So when cade suggested this I was stubborn and kept saying fuck no multiple times but she kept begging and begging and her boyfriend was begging me too so I said fuck it and hit it once. It didn’t really hit me hard at all and that was the end of that. Yesterday me and cade hang out again and again she pressures me into doing meth (I’m aware that I’m a grown woman who has control over her own actions) so I do meth with her and her meth head friends and I end up doing it for hours, until like 5 am. Now it’s 3:18 I still feel high and I’m having anxiety over the effects it might have had on my health and I’m really scared it damaged my kidneys or something and everything just feels really scary and stressful.

I don’t think my brother likes my boyfriend and I think that’s part of the problem.. My boyfriend  and I have a little bit of a toxic relationship pertaining to my moods swings and depression, and sometimes we get fights and hit each other but that’s besides the point, other than that, he’s the best man I’ve ever been with sounds weird I know.  during this project I got to spend time with my father that I never really got to. He recently had a stroke and had a stent put in.  who knows how much time he has left, but this is the first time I’ve really worked with my father hands-on And I think he sees how me and my boyfriend work together and sees how good of a job we do, my father seems in such good spirits. Every time I show up even my boyfriend said your father is so happy to see you every day. I never expected my father to then tell me that he doesn’t want to work with my brother anymore, because he just stands around and smokes his vape and really doesn’t do much.

I (F 24) work overnights and he works during the day time so it’s really hard considering we’re on opposite schedules. When we have sex once he isn’t satisfied and wants to keep going when I’m clearly tired. He also whips his dick out and tells me to look at it when I’m clearly not in the mood. This past weekend he started a fight with me while I was out with my friends (second time he did this) and he said “Idec anymore I don’t want to have sex” I just feel like he’s very demanding and it makes me want to do it less. I just don’t understand why we can’t have days where we just relax I don’t want to have sex every single day. And on top of it he won’t get his life together and I don’t want to wait for him anymore. I just want to be happy. I dont see things the same anymore he ruined it for me. This whole weekend he’s givin me the silent treatment refusing to speak to me and when I try to solve our issues he goes “I don’t know why your acting like nothings wrong” meanwhile when I try to speak to him, he gives me the silent treatment so how am I suppose to have a conversation when he refuses to speak to me? I don’t get it.

naomihasasecret,I did a threes*me with my boyfriend and girl best friend and something was off,0,1c51eu8,1,"When I was 17 I met a girl, Erika F23, who became my best friend. She had a male best friend, Alex M23, since kindergarten. They were true best friends. Their friendship haven’t always been platonic, since Erika likes to play with men’s desire and Alex would f*ck a rock if he could. He was funny and energetic, really nice to be around. We also became really close and ou friendship lasted 5 years, after that we started dating. It didnt cause any trouble in between our friendships with Erika, we had a lot of fun the three together. We were really open to talk about anything, even se*ual stuff. After 9 months of relationship, we were all together one night at Alex’s appartement, we were drinking and we had a threes*me. Im gonna save yall the details but I kept a very negative memory of it. The first reason of it is that we didnt establish the rules properly. Alex ended up c*ming inside of Erika’s body, which choked me, and I was even more horrified because we didnt use protection and Erika already got pregnant 2 times while being on the pill. This move was really stupid of Alex. The next morning I felt horrible. I cried and shared my feelings with both of them separately, I tried explaining how I felt left aside and now horrible about all this, without putting the blame on anyone, and that I wasnt jealous, because the fist problem was that we didnt establish rules properly. But it was too much to deal with alone. They reassured me, told me they both loved me and that it was just sex. They told me I shouldn’t feel like that, and that it will not cause any problems between any of us. These feelings kept living in me, but over time I moved on. I would occasionally be haunted by it again but would push away the thoughts in a few days. 

Until one day, yes that day happened. A YEAR AND A HALF after that night, Erika’s boyfriend, let’s call him Joe, texted me. What happened is he took her phone while she was sleeping because he suspected her of cheating. He went really far in the messages and eventually caught some interesting conversations between you guess who, her and Alex. They dated from more than a year ago. I could read on the screenshots messages like “i miss u” “you’re so sexy” and “come on send me another video like yesterday -perv emojis-“ I was stunned, my heart went racing. I confronted Alex about it, he denied until a called Erika on speakerphone asking for answers. I went furious, but they both said that it lasted about a week, was only on the phone, and that they stopped it because they felt so much guilt. I told Ericka to f*ck off and we stopped being friends. Alex and I had a hard time, but eventually we got through it, mostly because it was “almost anecdotic”.

Just like when we had the threes*me, after a few weeks I felt haunted by the thing. I was replaying moments, thinking about it all the time and couldnt help it but look back at the screenshots I had kept. Then, I finally understood why I was so obsessed, something was wrong. The affair may have last a week or so, but not any, the screenshots dated from the week before we had that threes*me. I was flabbergasted when I realized it, basically had been manipulated into letting my boyfriend have sex with my best friend who he was cheating on me with. And its worst, because I watched it! I participated! WTH! Its f*ck*ng disgusting! I still feel so disgusted by those memories, I have access of the actual footage of what happened, I felt left aside. I couldnt get over it this time, I went to therapy, we did a short couple therapy too, but some stuff happened and I just couldn’t. 

He never took the entire responsibility of what happened, denied that the threes*me was related to the “small affair”.

But we were friends for years before, I thought I knew him, same for Erika. He was sweet and lovely. He cried a lot and was desperate to get me back after we broke up. He kept trying for many months, and even tho its been a year, I miss him. I write this here in hope to have an opinion I havent heard, a neutral opinion. What do you people think about it? Did I overreact? Does it seem like I made links where there arent?

I'm so sick of being hung up over someone who couldn't care less about me. He probably sees me as a burden. I can just feel the sheer indifference and lack of consideration he has for me with almost everything he does. We're so bad for each other so why am I even upset over this. We'd never work out even if he did care. 

But I'm so attached and everything he does or says he effecting me so unbearably significantly. And it's so nice when he's good to me but I know that just serves to keep me where I am, unable to detach myself. 
I can't cut him off either because I can't bear it and I'm too weak and I can't imagine losing a friend. Despite all this we're still friends. I've been thinking for a while now to just tell him everything and be done with it. I don't know, but this is just no way to live. It's so pathetic, I can't believe I've become like this for a man. The most humiliating, pathetic ordeal I've ever subjected myself to. This situation is making me hate myself so much.

We have a 1yo that I handle 90% of the care when home. 1yo does attend care 2 days per week. Partner gets 2 days per week to themselves. 
I'm exhausted, I do all the nightly wakes and until recently 90% of the household 'chores' too, plus being the only income earner. Partner has began doing some household 'chores' but it does come in protest most of time or with the expectation of a medal. 

I've noticed them leave things for me to do. For example they will put the dishes away with the expectation that I will wash the next lot. 

Example of a day: 
4am - wake 
4am-7am - get myself and baby ready for day
7am - leave house, with baby. 
8am-4.30pm - work, most common shift, but they do change.
5.30pm-7.30pm - cook tea, feed baby, bath, dress, bottle, and bed for baby. 
7.30pm-9pm - clean up, relax, bed

Meanwhile my partner will have a play with baby and than sit and play games or play phone. 

I just feel like they expect me to do it all, which I wouldn't mind so much if they were working, because when they do work it's often in full time positions so I feel it's shared more equally. 

I guess my expectations maybe whack, but I feel like if I'm doing 90% of child care, 100% of the financial contribution, can't they at least do 80% of the household? 

Just needed somewhere to vent! 👌

I’ve been holding this one for a long while. Ever since middle school actually. Every time I had a friend group, I was the funny guy with the physical humor and my friends enjoyed having me in. But I would also support my friends in hard times. I’ve also shared my enjoyment for rap music and video games. I’m not the best looking person in the group but I don’t think that’s a factor that plays into what I say. All the people in my friend groups always use my traits to pull girls or to have the spotlight on them, while I watch and feel robbed. For example, I am very good at doing accents and mimic voice actors and one of the guys in my then friend group started copying one of my voices and doing a very not good job doing it and got famous in the school for doing it and never even considered giving me credit, but I at least had the real ones in my group that actually supported me. This bad feeling of getting robbed is what bothers me a lot. I don’t wanna confront my friends on this matter cuz first of all I’m not the type of guy to voice things that annoy me about friends and secondly I feel that I’m going to be called an egotist and probably be kicked off the group entirely. A lot of you are probably going to say that I should be felling good for my friends for noticing me and my traits and be happy for theirs success but I don’t.

mindue505,Boyfriend's ex is dating our close friend/bandmate- to get at my bf?,2,1c4p9qw,0,"My (42f) boyfriend (37m) and I have been together over a year now, we live together, and we're musicians in 2 bands together.

My boyfriend's ex (34f) was some chick he dated mannnnny years ago (15 years ago) and unsuccessfully tried to spark up something w her again recently (jan-feb 2023) before we started dating (mar 2023). In short, they went on a couple dates and both decided to ""remain friends"" as to which my boyfriend basically grew tired of her games and decided to give dating me a chance.

This chick- let's call her Tori - seems like a narcissist, talks shit about people, and has a history of leading men on and not committing, which was some of the numerous valid reasons why my boyfriend dislikes her so. In fact, when he finally gave up dating her, he was done w the whole friend group she associates with, even though they were mostly his friends first. While she friendzoned my bf before we started going out, she found out a few months later he moved on w me and confronted him. I saw the conversation, and it was pretty hilarious. It was basically like a ""how dare you date someone when I told you that we could be friends""? 

His ex Tori brought a ""date"" to one of our big/important shows last Oct (Oct 2023) and was all over her date that night, as if to spark some jealousy on my boyfriend's behalf and ruin our night. Nothing happened, and my boyfriend (and I) both thought it was pretty crazy of her to try and elicit a response from my bf, especially after we had been together several months at that point.

Fast forward a few months to current...

Tori was NEVER a musician prior, but recently started up a band as the lead singer, mostly consisting of men she's dated and/or slept w in the past. She also enlisted our drummer twice over (Joey) on her project, and had to choose the very same night we jam with our rock project, therefore imposing a curfew on our drummer to stop jamming w us at a certain time every Sunday in order to get over and jam with all them.

And now our bandmate/friend (and band leader of our metal project) Shawn is dating her (!!) as they've been friends for a decade, and he's crushed on her. Shawn even dumped his last gf for a chance w Tori, even though according to my bf, she always talked shit about our bandmate Shawn. Shawn came on super strong to Tori in Feb this year, and supposedly she claimed she was never into Shawn until he ""lovebombed"" her for her bday, so now she ""thinks of him differently"". IMO if you're friends w someone for 10 years, the spark of attraction is either there or it isn't- I've experienced this first hand in my past. For her to never have been attracted to our bandmate Shawn prior, then all of a sudden, they're like a happily married couple a month later lol - seems sus 100%.

Now Tori comes to most of our shows, and my bf and I get a lot of flack by choosing not to attend parties at our bandmate's house in order to avoid his ex Tori and the group of disloyal immature friends who worship her.

Am I...am I tripping to think that this Tori chick is being all ""single white female"" on us? Hanging all over her date at a show, then starting up her own band (when she never was in a music project prior), and now dating our bandmate Shawn and locking up most of our band leader's attention and time.

Honestly? Some days, I feel like I should just give up on my relationship - and both bands - since this Tori chick is stopping at nothing to interfere and cause drama in our lives, and I hate soapbox drama bs. It seems like no one ever rejects her, and since she perceives my bf did- she has some nefarious plan to ruin our lives/bands/friendships. Furthermore, I even wonder if my bf and I would even be together if she didn't friendzone him? She's younger and thinner, but that's where she stops winning against me. 

Any thoughts? Advice? Lol

Then I decided to show all my make-up and then suddenly my sister decides to mess with me, opens up the mascara and puts it on her eye (just a little but). I know I must sound crazy right now. But one thing about me is that nobody, and I mean anybody I don’t want touches my things. I go crazy. And I mean it. I started crying screamed for my mom and went to my room. I feel like a weirdo right now but at the same time I am so mad. That’s also not an unusual thing to happen, I am very particular about some things, one of those things is that certain people NEVER and I mean NEVER get to touch ANY of my stuff. and if they do I go crazy, it‘s like I can‘t function anymore. But at the same time I am so mad. My sister knows I hate when people touch my stuff (my mother also told her afterwards), and this time I was so excited that I even let her open it, but when she put it on her I eye I just, I couldn’t. I just can‘t. She does this every time and she knows I hate it. Even when it’s just clothes (She also isn’t allowed to go in my room, I don’t like it).

Don’t get me wrong there’s nothing wrong with being a mama’s boy. I’ve read multiple articles online about the benefits of it and I can attest to that. But unfortunately my bf’s mom isn’t okay with the idea of him having another girl in her son’s life and that’s where the big problem arises. I’ve been dealing with this ever since we started dating & we’re 17 months now. 

Now the situation gets harder as times passes by. Her mom is currently living on a diff country and whenever his mom visits, her mom doesn’t want to share his “baby” to me. He’s not allowed to sleep over at my place when his mom is here. (When my bf’s mom is not here he stays at my place) Her mom never invited me on any of their family gatherings. My bf says that I’m only creating scenarios in my head and there’s no problem in that. I just have to wait for his mom to warm up on me. But how can she warm up on me if she doesn’t want to get to know me at all :( :( :( She’s good at making me feel that I am not welcome in their family and honestly the feeling sucks. She just wants her son all to herself. 

I know I’m not the problem here because even if my bf dated a different girl, the situation will be the same. It’s just sad that my bf doesn’t have freedom whenever his mom is here. It’s like I need to be the more understanding one all the time just because her mom isn’t always here. It’s sad that my bf doesn’t really get how I really feel about it. I mean i have feelings too :( It’s like whenever his mom is here I need to suck it up and do things on my own because he can’t be emotionally and phsyically available. Honestly I feel like I’m dating a high schooler because of the “rules” (my bf is 28 btw) Uhm i really don’t know how to move on from this.

I’ve taken on some part time gigs that I have coming up in may which are all dog walking jobs but it’ll help give me some income as I currently have none. I’m considering everything in my life, I didn’t go to university when I was 18 as covid hit and I didn’t know what I’d do with a degree, and now I’m considering that as an option but don’t know if I am going to go for the wrong reasons (what attracts me is becoming a therapist or art therapist which can only be done by uni course where I live, I also want to move away from home and gain some independence because I just feel like the biggest burden on my parents) I’m looking at part time college courses I could take but nothings really available until September and I need something to do between then, it’s now been 5 weeks and I’m also worrying about how my CV looks to employers. Luckily I’m living with my parents still so they’ve let me off paying rent until I can get back into working, but they’re starting to get frustrated with me because they don’t see me doing anything, I got upset the other night and showed them the long list of things I’ve applied for on indeed, in healthcare and have even taken to going into shops to hand my CV in (old fashioned style - not that it’s done that way anymore I’ve found) to try and keep busy with my day ( and to compensate for not paying rent) I do my parents washing, ironing, cleaning and dog care as well as running around to pick stuff up for them/drive around and run their errands, but they’re desperate for me to stop and get something more stable (annoying thing is, when I got my full time job they got annoyed that I wasn’t doing all those jobs for them so they’ll be annoyed whatever but atleast I can pay rent again) 

What doesn’t help is that I don’t know what to sort of job I want to do, I tried law in my apprenticeship, didn’t enjoy it, I’ve tried writing all the pros and cons down of what I enjoyed and didn’t enjoy and the only thing that came out the other end of that was a therapist/ art therapist but I don’t have a psychology alevel, I have an art alevel but I think I’d have to go to uni to progress on that too which leads me back to that debt. 


I just feel so so lost and I don’t know what I’m doing with my life, I really don’t know how to make myself sellable, but also the only thing going through my head at the moment is to run away from it all, go to uni, get a degree and do it that way, it will open up so many more doors for me but I also don’t want to/ can’t afford to get into debt. 

Don’t get me wrong, I think now it was the right call to leave my old job, but it doesn’t help but make me feel like a waste of breath right now, I just wish I could get the answers and get a job.

A bit unrelated, but I also really like being kind, helping and caring about people (one of my favourite things), mostly they are friends as I am quite anxious socially. I also really like hugs. I hear and see that those things should be done by women instead.

Despite usually being cautious with my private data, I trusted her without question. Regrettably, I handed over my biometric information without considering the consequences. Since then, I've been plagued by worry. What will they do with my data? How could I have been so careless?

I already know that would be the end of it. they wouldn't even know who I was or what I wanted from them, probably just wasting their time. maybe just telling me that I need help and therapy. but that's ok. It's that end I need to be able to move on already. again. there is no other way for me. but I have no clue how to even reach them at all. I feel like such a creep. but seeing them. is something essential for me to move on. last issue.

Aardvark_Jazzlike,older brother (27) assaulted me (20) and still lives at home,3,1c4l9dq,3,"for context my older brother just recently moved in after my parents couldn’t afford paying for his apartment since he doesn’t have a job to help out. ever since he moved in he’s had random bouts of aggression and he will go ape shit for like 10-15 minutes over the smallest difference in opinion. well, one day, he got super mad over something (i cant remember what but it was dumb) and i chose to ignore him and keep playing videogames instead of feeding into his anger. he then decides to open my door and scream at me so i tell him to leave, after he disagrees multiple times i slowly push him out the room and close the door, well he didn’t like this at all. so he starts freaking out even more and ends up rushing in and attacking me completely unprepared. luckily after gaining my ground i one shot elbowed him in the face and he was down on the ground but that’s besides the point. the point is, after all that he still lives here and does nothing but get angry at the people who’ve done everything for him (my parents) and it’s been escalating and i’m worried he’s gonna take it too far one day because my brother is borderline psychotic.",1713184993.0,
Narrow_Mission4909,A candid rant regarding my position at work. ,3,1c4l536,0,"I’ve been an ICU nurse for 10 years. I’ve been an ICU NP for close to 1 years. 

I feel lonely, lost, annoyed, angry, and tired. 

For starters being a nurse practitioner feels very lonely to me, at least it does at my hospital, in my department.

The physicians are mostly ungrateful and only bark orders their precious little fingers can’t bother to put in themselves, or demand you call consults they can’t ever call for themselves, because God forbid they have to personally communicate with another service. 

The nurses don’t see you as a nurse. They don’t see you as a colleague. It is almost as if they see nurse practitioners as defectors, enemies to shun. They will give pushback, despite kindly explaining the plan of care, these same nurses will make sure to question every single order that has already been discussed. 

I think that with having an NP between the RN and the MD causes the NP to be on the receiving end of the “I’ll show that doctor” mentality. If you are a nurse you KNOW what I’m talking about. That defiant attitude of going against the doctor or thinking you know better, and sometimes the nurses do know better - but often times their focus is very narrow and singular and their opinion on the patient problems and treatments plans are invalid. 

It is much easier to speak up when you are 99.9% certain you know the answer, than it is to be expected to make an accurate or close to accurate answer 99.9% of the time. 

The ICU = some have an attitude, think they know better, give pushback. 
Some of this can be forgiven when the nurse is a decent nurse and can truly make a difference with a sick patient or a patient requiring TLC. A nurse that is vigilant of changes in clinical status, knows for the most part what is relevant and what is white noise. 

The floors = annoying during rapids. Hyper-excitable. Thinks every rapid needs to go ICU. Only thought is transferring pt to ICU. 
Little pushback given but this can be bad as well. They focus on none issues and just completely miss the big issues. 

My biggest pet peeve is when nurses fail to realize you have more than 2, 3, or 6 patients. You have 20-30 critically ill patients and depending on the doctors you are mostly alone. Some of the nurses need to fix their expectations on timely order inputs. They believe their needs are the only needs. I get that you have a patient waiting for transfer, discharge, etc. but I have to triage the needs of up to 30 patients and because I’m responsible for the outcomes, it is my license on the line. I refuse to be rushed or pressured into making a decision or a discharge when said decision or discharge is not an emergency. I believe THEY believe a discharge happens with a simple snap of my finger. 

The doctors need to realize I am one person and I am catering to several physicians and nurses.

Our friend group was together, our theater colleagues were together and almost everything we’ve had was together.
 
A week ago we had an argument which included his mother aswel. We’ve had the same argument before but his mother wasn’t included so we somehow managed to get through it and continued our relationship.
 

After the argument a week ago he told me to leave him alone and we did not speak for a week. He messaged and called me until Wednesday. He told me that he loved me and wanted to talk about this issue face to face and solve everything we can. Wednesday was a holiday in my country so I messaged his mother and he stopped messaging me after I messaged his mother. Then we did not speak until yesterday. Yesterday he called me to meet up and when we met up he told me that he wanted to breakup because he felt as this relationship was too much on his shoulders. I told him that he could give it another thought and he said that he was sure and wanted to break up. We talked a bit more and that was the last time we saw eachother. 

I don’t know how exactly I’m feeling, I don’t know if I feel upset or mad. I’ve spent 2 years with him and out of nowhere we broke up. It hurts that someone I’ve always said goodnight and good morning is not there anymore and it makes me feel lonely but I also feel free because he was somewhat controlling. I tried to cry but I can’t for some reason. This is my first serious breakup and I don’t know what I’m feeling. Do I feel like this because somehow in a place in my mind I still think we are going to be back together? I’ve never felt like this so I don’t know what’s happening.

HeartlessUsagi,Lost a friend because of a video game 🤷🏻‍♀️,2,1c4nu2t,4,"Posted this somewhere else, but got dragged down lmao :’) 
It sucks, but oh well. 

Me, my friend, and her BF, let’s call him Pete, were playing GTA online back in February. Pete got drunk and we all decided to go on gamechat. I didn’t really speak, but Pete started going off of the players we were fighting. He then started talking mad shit about Mexicans and being super racist, knowing my friend is Mexican. I was like wtf. Anyways. He apologized and my friend excused it on him being drunk. I was like “uuuuhhhh okaaayyy”. Whatever. Last week, I was at work, when he says in the group chat “so (my name) is fucking us up now??” I didn’t see the notification until I got off work, but when I went to check, the group chat wasn’t there anymore. My friend then calls me, but I couldn’t answer. 

Turns out someone “exposed” Pete being a racist asshat on YouTube-that what he gets, BUT bro claimed they were my “friends”. I’ve met and added people on GTA online, but they all play on new gen (PS5). Pete, my friend, and I were playing on old gen (PS4), so it wasn’t making any sense. I have accounts on both, so yeah. Also, when I asked for proof, Pete didn’t say anything and stood quiet, so I’m like “is this man lying?? Does he want to separate my friend and I?” So I texted him on Instagram. I told him if he didn’t want to be my friend anymore, then fine, I won’t force it or beg for a friendship, but my friend didn’t do anything for him to break up with her. He hasn’t replied to this day, and I asked him for proof again since he was accusing me of something I didn’t even do! Here I am still waiting for the proof about this whole mess. Haven’t gotten not even the usernames yet, nor the video that supposedly got posted on YouTube. 

People need to touch grass and stop taking a damn game way too serious. It’s wild how I lost a friendship because bro believed them more, yet he didn’t give any proof. Is he lying? Maybe. Tbh maybe he made this whole thing up. Maybe it happened but for some reason he doesn’t want to give my friend and I the proof. Idk man.

Ordinary-Stick3366,In actual pieces after losing my gf,1,1c4tenv,10,"My girlfriend broke up with me last month (both 19). We’ve been together since we were 15, lived together for 3 years before going back to long distance (my dad kicked her out). We would see each other pretty regularly. Then she got very unhappy because she wanted her life and job back.

So now we fast forward to march, and she told me she didn’t want to be together anymore because she’s miserable, at first I thought it was for the best. But now I am utterly fucking destroyed. I have NEVER felt as much pain and regret as I’m feeling now, it’s honesty getting worse everyday and I genuinely cannot handle this much longer. I miss her so much, she was my world for 4 years and I can’t handle this. I was her first boyfriend, kiss everything. She was pure and the most beautiful person I know. The thought of her finding another guy is making me want to kill myself, I know it’s crazy but it’s just how I feel.

She’s since removed and blocked me on everything and doesn’t want to talk about it.

I decided to send her some flowers which arrive tomorrow, which a card and cake since I know she likes flowers. I hope this might ignite something and she will message me. I’m really tempted to actually go to her house with flowers, but I don’t want to scare her.

Im also so scared for her because she started Prozac a week before breaking up with me and she said she had 0 emotion. Maybe she will realise she still loves me? Whatever happens I am staying loyal to her, and still telling other girls I’m not interested, because I’m still utterly in love with her.

I also was made redundant from my job a couple months ago and so this might be the final thing that tips me over the edge. Literally all I have is my family and the gym.

sjsjdbaihd,Thinking about rehoming my 3yo dog,1,1c4tawy,0,"
Hi. I know I will probably get a lot of negative comments for posting this but I don’t know what to do.
My husband and I adopted a golden retriever puppy over 3 years ago. We are a very active family and took her on long walks and hikes multiple times a week right off the bat. 
Shes been a VERY hyper dog since the minute we brought her home, she has a ton of energy no matter how much she exercises.
She doesn’t listen, jumps on people (inside the house or when people try to pet her outside), eats off the table and the list goes on… we got a trainer and then decided to put her in an intensive training boot camp for 3 weeks last summer since we weren’t seeing improvements. $2k later, NO CHANGES. 
We can’t help it but to resent her for it. She is not a mean or aggressive dog but she just doesn’t listen or care about authority (from a trainer or from us). 
We then had a baby about a year ago and we do not have the time to take her on hikes anymore so we take her on daily walks and have her at daycare once a week so she can play with other dogs and get her energy out.
She is out of control and we don’t know what to do anymore, she isn’t responsive to trainers, e-collar, leash inside the house, crate training, we tried everything.
We dread having family or friends over because we know she’ll jump on them, bark and whine non stop if we put her in the crate and this just creates a very stressful and anxiety inducing environment. We sometimes let her stay overnight at the daycare just to have dinner at home with our family and friends. But with the baby too, the expenses are getting very high and we’re struggling. We can’t put that much money in boarding or training anymore.
We have an apartment on the ground floor with a front yard and she’s out there most of the day. 
We have a caregiver that takes care of our baby and I can tell she hates our dog too… the minute she turns around, our dog jumps on the counter, steals the food she prepares for the baby, doesn’t listen to her and I’m worried she wants to leave for that reason. 

I’ve had dogs my whole life and was always so in love with them but if I’m being very honest, I don’t like my dog, and I feel awful for it. 
I know my husband feels the same and I’m sure she can feel it. 
She deserves a better life. She deserves to be with a family that loves cares and gives her the attention and exercise she needs. We just don’t have that bandwidth. At least, not anymore.

What should we do? 
If we were to rehome her it would be with a family. I wouldn’t give her to a shelter because I know she would be devastated, she needs attention.

Unadieya,I slept with my friend/coworker and I don’t know what to do now,1,1c4t8n3,1,"This has been a long long saga that has been eating me up and I just need to vent somewhere since everyone within a 5 mile radius has heard all about it. I (20f) had this childhood friend growing up, we went to the same school and got along well enough. we weren’t super close but close enough that when he left I was devastated. I had vague memories of him and I remembered his name and face. Well, I started at a new job, and unfortunately I also broke up with my long-term boyfriend at the time. It was really hard adjusting and being single again it was taking a lot of time to get use to.

Well at this job I ran into said childhood friend, he recognized me at first and initiated contact. We talked a little bit inside and out of work, I quickly developed feelings for him ( stupid, I know. Don’t fall for a coworker it makes work weird). On one really difficult night he picked me up and we drove a bit, parked somewhere and talked. He let me get everything going on out in the air and it was so reliving to open up about the contents of my breakup to its full extent. Looking back he didn’t really care, he was on his phone the whole time and only had the comment of “I’m use to this my exes had a bunch of trauma too” but for me, it was still something.

Admittedly I took the first step towards him and in a twisted fate we became fwb. We were friends and texted near daily. We saw each other outside work not three or four times before he blew me off. It really hurt because we had a once a week agreement. I tried to talk with him more about it and we came back to the same conclusion we would meet once a week to see each other. Well  one week after this he’s acting sorta weird and distant. Then the next night he is buttering me up telling me how much he wants to see me and how much he misses me. We talked about seeing each other and once again he backs out last minute to play games with his friends. I felt really fed up and confronted him;

All he had to say was “ you’re not my gf if I spent time with you the way you wanted me to id never see anyone else” defeated we didn’t talk for a while. I journaled how i was feeling, and that I didn’t want to spend everyday with him, but I did want to see him once a week like we agreed. When we finally spoke again he never acknowledged any of what happened and while I tried to talk about it, it went nowhere and I couldn’t really explain what I felt. We talked casually as friends for a while with a few bumps and that was fine.

Two nights before a big trip he was taking we texted and he initiated romantic and sexual talk. I got excited and naively played along because I thought maybe this was going to lead to a bigger conversation. He kept talking about coming over and wanting to hold me. I was so so excited, I cleaned my house, made some snacks, I got an outfit put together… the night comes and he says he’s not coming over. At this point I’m devastated and quite frustrated because I don’t understand why he wanted to see me and would flake out AGAIN! So I said to him that I feel like he doesn’t care about me, or my feelings, or my time. He left me on read. 

I only contacted him once during his trip to tell him about something big concerning work. He blew off my single message. Well finally, he contacts me out of the blue to tell me about a girl he just met on the way back from his trip and how they are already dating. I said congrats, and I’m glad he found someone. He told me a bit more and then when the conversation was over I unfriended him. This was probably immature but I was hurt about this whole situation, and considering he knew I liked him this felt like a stab in my chest to not ever acknowledge what I said about not feeling my time or feelings cared for, and then coming back and telling me about this girl you just met and are immediately dating.

I’ve been mulling over in my head what to do, how to move forward. I feel like I did this to myself but part of me feels so angry and confused. I think the best thing to do is just feel and move on as coworkers, pretend nothing happened between us. But I just don’t know what I’m feeling besides anger, confusions, and sadness.",1713204962.0,

I’m female, have been very mature (told by teachers, professors, other parents) since I was early teens. Yes, I did stupid shit, but 85% of the time I minded my P’s and Q’s, didn’t take anyone’s shit, did my job, the job at hand and didn’t let anyone get the better of me. 

Until my last job with the county I live in. It was a full team of 21 people, but in 4 different teams mine was 5 people plus our supervisor. Another team member and my boss got along great so I got to hear how much he wants to masturbate and jizz all over the carpet to mark his territory. My boss just laughed it off along with all the other managers. I just ignored it. No I didn’t tell HR when she asked I said no all razzing and crap was above board. Had 2 guys on my team who one constantly belittled the other one. I assume cuz he knew the other guy didn’t care and was more knowledgeable than him so he belittled him to make himself feel better. I know I never want to meet his kids they’re probably the same way. But why did I quit? Cuz one team member didn’t do anything, but got paid $62,000 a year for just sitting on his ass at either work or wfh. I had done 8 remote sessions, 3 phone call tickets, working on another remote session when my boss decided to assign me another ticket but not the lazy ass. He just kept watching videos. I was/am sick and tired of doing most of the work while the others bicker at each other, play with nerf guns, or go to admin offices and just sit and chat all day while they get behind I close my tickets so then guess who gets tickets assigned cuz they’re behind. Yup me. 

On a team of 5 people technically 6, cuz the supervisor did tickets as well. I did 60% of the work. Supervisor easily did 25%, while the other 4 guys piddled around. But they don’t ever get fired. But yet I was reprimanded twice for stupid shit. Cuz I sent a caller to another team. Why did I send it and not do it? Well, 1. Cuz I never got a badge for that building. 2. It was their customers the LEO side of it. 3. I was already busy so I had them call their LEO - IT. And I got reprimanded twice for it. But one of my guys did the exact same thing and was told yup that’s how that supervisor wanted it done. 

So I snapped. Threw my mouse into my monitor (both mine I bought personally) walked out. Tried to calm myself down enough to go back in and keep going. But no, I decided enough was enough. I’d had enough of their immature bullshit. So I packed my shit grabbed my 2 monitors (1 broken) and quit. Handed in my door key and walked away. 

That was Wednesday. It’s now Monday and my bills are paid until end of the month. Then, I’m screwed. No I don’t have a savings. I’ve had to use it to fix my house: roof caved in, in master bathroom, electrical work 1/4 of my house had no power for a few months, septic system backed up into the house, had to buy a new washer cuz mine was taking 6-10 hours to finish 1 load it would continuously go unleveled. Then, have my Wrangler that thankfully has been broken free please don’t break down anytime soon. 

I’ve applied to almost 20 jobs some I’m very qualified, some I know the job just never done it full time like Azure Admin stuff. I just need a job fast cuz I’m a damn fool and let stupid little boys annoy me so bad. ",1713204886.0,

I met a girl a few months ago, she is fun, playful, very interesting and we have many things in common, from music and movies we enjoy to some values and ways of seeing life. I knew from the begining she was a lesbian, so I didn't even consider her a potential partner when we started seeing each other. I realised recently that I miss her when she's not around, I want to talk to her a lot, even when I have nothing to say, I think about her... I think I have some feelings for her, and I don't really know what to do about those. Telling her may ruin our friendship, not telling her feels kind of wrong.",1713204135.0,
Throwaway_7156,We broke up after 11 years. She replaced me in 6 months,2,1c4nbhu,5,"Throwaway account, also not a mothertongue, so I'll make mistakes.

I always had a stormy relationship with her. We met first year of university where she was the beautiful girl with rich traditional parents who spoiled her and opposed our relationship since the beginning.

Because n.1 I was too young to make marriage plans and n.2 I was too humble for their aspirations. Nonetheless we kept going with short break ups every 2-3 years. Major problem was money. I was too young, my parents barely allowed me to survive and I had chosen a long university career. She was in great mood away from her family, but as soon as she was exposed to their views, humiliations and reprisals, hell broke loose in her mind.

Her family was obsessed with money and luxury. Younger sister married the rich kid of a family of builders after just 2 years of engagement , a sneaky douche constantly shooting jabs at me with plenty time to spend around his fiancè, every week a present, vacations and everything paid everywhere. While she made ""the worst bet, the penniless schoolboy with a long way ahead"".

In addition to her distress, both our careers struggled to get off, but every time we had an argument she demolished my self esteem by comparing me to the brother in law. You're the man, you should have your stuff together at 30, I'm constantly ashamed by my parents because of you!

One day her mother confronted me: you take her and marry her, now. No more wait, she's 30 years old and rotting because of you. No more application for better jobs, take what you have and marry her. Or let her go once and for all. She's still in time!

After many struggles, I decided for my mental health to let her go. Sense of guilt was destroying me. She and her family wanted marriage and a baby asap, but at the same time, they required a 50k $ wedding cerimony, and me to be a successful man providing her with the best lifestyle. I was struggling with anxiety and depression and imagined this baby humbled by his rich cousins, imagined my wife unable to sustain the shame. Also, was she really the right person for me? a woman unable to sustain any kind of stress, who faded away from me as soon as hard times came in?

I let her go.

We met a couple more times in the following months, but all of a sudden she disappeared. I wanted her so much, but I wanted her happiness more than everything and the sense of guilt for being unable to give her the life she wanted was hauntig. At some point I even wished her marrying some rich guy she always hoped for. One year and six months have passed since then.

PLOT TWIST hit me hard. I discovered from her close friends that 6 months after our breakup she was already living with another guy. Her parents donated her 2 luxury apartments and don't pressure her anymore for marriage or babies. She's enjoying the good life in her 30s.

How could this happen after just six months? Why isn't she pressured anymore to marry and have a baby?",1713190552.0,
DiurnalByNight,I am in love,5,1c4iub1,0,"Oh, to feel like this again.

Like all the scars can heal a little faster, like I can live with past mistakes, like I can really grab the moment. Because I've got you. A smile so genuine, eyes that don't ever stop shining, and a mind so full of joy and strength and wonder.

I stare somtimes. Not just because of how beautiful you are, but because of the words you say. How you make me smile even when I try not to, how you make me laugh till I cry, how you make me feel so seen. It is a priviliege to know you.

My cheeks fill with color, my stomach churns, and my chest tosses and turns. I could have never imagined I deserved someone like you, but it's not about deserving. It's about being as good to you as you are to me.

And to know that you feel it too. And that you're not afraid to let me hear it, time and time again. You are light.

Throwawaaaypotato23,My friend wants me to take accountability for how I reacted but I don’t feel like I was wrong?,2,1c4n0sl,5,"
So about a month ago I invited some friends over for a housewarming/get together at my place. We were of course drinking, having a good time, etc. Then I was sitting on the couch just enjoying everyone’s company when my two best friends (we’ve been friends for 10+ years) came over and tried to give me a shot. I refused and shook my head. 

They then tried to grab my face/ pinch my nose and force the shot on me. I tried getting away from them and ultimately went down to the floor to escape. One of them sat on my chest while the other tried to still get me to drink the shot. 

The shot ended up spilling and going down my nose instead. I got up, went to the bathroom to collect myself. When I came back out, I went up to the both of them and told them “don’t ever do that again”


After the party ended, the next day I get a text from one of the friends saying she didn’t like my behavior and how I was acting. That I said I’d “drop her” and she took it as a physical threat. I told her I don’t remember ever making a comment like that, but apparently she said everyone around her heard me say that. Obviously even IF I did say that it wasn’t with the intention of being physical, but more so in the sense of I’d drop her as a friend. 

She’s insistent that I apologize and take accountability for what I said and keeps saying I’m making excuses for my actions. I feel like how I reacted wasn’t wrong and I’m so confused. ",1713189808.0,
Ill_Childhood_3730,What to do?,1,1c4shj0,0,"I have been talking to this guy (25 M) for a little more than 2 months. I wasn’t interested at all in the beginning for more than friendship. But in some way he made me fall for him. I (24 F) have borderline and it’s really hard for me with relationships in general. But anyways, he told me really cute stuffs, that he liked me for my personality, he like my voice, he liked everything with me of what he have seen and yea. We have been asking each other about our days, how we’ve been doing and so on. He also knows how bad sleep I have and he have been caring a lot about it and always tried to make sure I get sleep. But one day he was drunk and he kinda gave me a love explanation and I was shocked and didn’t say much, but he actually made my heart happy. But the day after, he started to ghost me, he stopped asking me stuff at all and it felt like I’ve done something wrong but I can’t remember anything I would’ve done to make him like this. I didn’t think much about it, I was trying to ask him how he was cause I was thinking he might just have a bad day. But he literally ghosted me for a week, but he made sure that we didn’t lose our Snapstreak and that just didn’t make sense to me when he didn’t even answer any of my questions. Well I did ask his best friend if he knew how he was cause I got worried, and he told me they didn’t have a lot of contact but he was going to check it up. Anyways, the guy I’m talking with, we can call him A, he told me that the only people he’s speaking to is me and his best friend which I wrote to. But I did start checking his snap score after one week of ghosting me and it got higher everytime I checked it (I know that’s weird of me) and I wasn’t one of the people he was snapping so he was lying to me. After like 9 days he started to answer my questions and I asked him about why he is lying to me about that he only have contact with me and his best friend. He then told me about a lot of other people he are snapping, but I just felt why didn’t he just say so in the beginning instead of lying to me? I wouldn’t even care, he can talk to how many people he want as long as he stays loyal, it’s just the thing that he lied to me about that small stuff. I asked him if he still was interested in me, and he said yes, and I also asked him if we shall continue to “date” or not cause he didn’t show any interest, and he said yes and he wants to see if we might be a couple in the future. So I asked him to show more interest and he said he would and that he promise. The days go by, he is sending me snaps a little more often but nothing more than that. And I’m getting anxious and my brain tells me just leave him he doesn’t care at all about us, but my heart wants him so bad and want this to work. I told him that I hope he understands that I’m losing interest when he doesn’t put any effort in this, and he says sorry and that he will start with that again and promises me that. It takes two days, and now it seems like he starts to ghost me again. I don’t know what to do, I like him a lot, and my borderline and that shit doesn’t make anything easier. And I hope someone have time to read this, cause I need tips for what to do. My brain and hearts wants two different things, how do I know if I shall listen to the heart or brain?? I’m feeling totally helpless in this, so I’m begging for advice and if someone been in this kind of position what you’ve done or would’ve done if you were in this position.

BardBardNooth,Im in love with my bestfriend and I dont know why,1,1c4s4c9,0,"He and I have been friends for 6 years. I always thought he was cute, funny, and had a great personality. We have a lot in common. One time, we were at a party, both drunk, talking in the hallway, and we just started kissing. Everyone saw. After that, he wanted me to help him in the bathroom, nothing sexual, just to make sure he didn't fall. After he was done, we just started talking more he started saying he's bi, and I said I was gay, so we both came out, I guess. It was my first kiss from a guy, and that's when I started to fall in love with him. But after the party, when we were hanging out, he said, ""Yeah, that kiss meant nothing. I don't want you to get the wrong idea."" I was sad when he said that, but I had to respect it. But after that, I started thinking (red flag) maybe I have a chance to get with him one day if I try. But sadly, he was at a party drunk and kissed a girl (she has a kid and is in an open relationship), and now they're dating. That's when I was like, ""Wow, that kiss really meant nothing to him."" But I got over it. I still always had that little bit of hope that maybe one day he'd give me a chance, but I suppressed it because it sounded dumb, and I wanted to move on. I tried listing all the red flags, and there were a lot, but I still can't get over it. I tried looking for a relationship for myself and moving on from him, but it's so hard, aka Tinder and Grindr suck. (Oh, by the way, we're roommates now.) And he has his new girlfriend stay for like 4-5 weeks every other month at a time, and it just makes me so depressed hearing them talk about how much they love each other, and I'm just like, ""Damn, I'm going to die alone, and no one loves me, blah blah."" But I'm happy for him. I hope they're happy together. It's  me thing. I just need to move on, but it's just hard. And I know I can't force a relationship, but it's just when your crush gives you a kiss, it's hard to let go of it. I've never told anyone this, and I probably never will, but I just wanted to get this off my chest.",1713202351.0,

I sometimes say my feelings or thoughts and we talk about it, but then if they say stop thinking negatively or something , I feel like I can’t do I keep going. That in turn makes them mad or kills the fun mood we had going on. I don’t realize it in the moment it’s only afterwards that I see how unfun or negative I was being. Idk if it’s because I have bpd and that’s why I sort of just rant even if people try to help me to stop feeling bad. I’m not trying to excuse anything though, id just like to know if anyone else has gone through this and how did you overcome constant self sabotage. It feels suffocating and it makes me feel so guilty to constantly ruin my relationships with the ones I love, some of them don’t want to hangout after certain rants and I understand, no one wants to be with a person who is negative.

Sugar_N_Cyanide,My bf said he’d off himself if I ever tried to leave him last weekend ,19,1c4a3rv,27,"My (23f) boyfriend (34m) told me he’d off himself after we had an argument that escalated to me almost wanting to end our relationship. We’ve been dating for about a year and 4 months now and he’s never acted like this before. It’s been giving me an icky and scared feeling even a week later because I’m worried I will never be able to leave him even if the time comes where I’d want to. I do love him very much and don’t want to break up with him anytime soon, we’ve just signed a year lease on a new apartment but things have just been a bit rough. We both have pretty significant mental health issues but I’ve been going to therapy to work on mine which has helped immensely. I told him how trapped it made me feel when he said that and how lowkey abusive it is to say something to someone like that but his response was just somewhere along the lines of “well I’d have no desire to live if you broke up with me so”. I know how manipulative and abusive this tactic is and I do have experience with exes acting immature and manipulative like this but it’s just caught me so off guard because my current bf has never acted like this before and now I’m worried I’ve created yet another fantasized relationship that’s crumbling and showing it’s true colors right before my very eyes. I have a history of attachment and abandonment issues, jumping from one serious relationship to another to feel secure and safe and I’m just so worried and scared. Just wanted to vent. So sorry for the messy post this is just something that has been plaguing my mind. Thx for reading if you got this far🫶🏻

,Stuck in my hostel room,2,1c4mahf,0,"I am 20 years old and I am stuck with 3 roommates in my hostel room. We have had verbal fights many times. They have often locked me inside the room (5 times in 5 months) and have refused to ever take accountability, let alone apologize. Apart from this, there have been other issues too (not letting me charge my phone, ingoring me, etc.). Yesterday, we fought again, and I called the hostel warden in tears ( the first time I cried since coming to the hostel ) and told her about everything and asked her to change my room. Today I found out that the warden had told the whole college about the issue and when she came today with another warden, all the faults were pinned on me.

I am not a saint. I too get angry. When they locked me for the first time, I playfully tried to find out who did this and lightly hit one of my roommates in jest. It was only when they refused to take responsibility that I started to ignore them. I did not file an official complain at that time as I wanted not to create an issue. But yesterday, I had reached the limit of my tolerance and had no choice but to complain.

Today, my roommates said that everything was my fault. They also said that I had hit my roommates forcefully and that they had never done anything. I, being the stupid person that I am, acknowledged that I had hit her, but I told them that had done that in a light and playful manner. The warden refused to listen to me that told me that I was the one creating problems due to lack of control over my emotions.

Both of the wardens refused to listen to me and told me if I couldn't adjust I should leave the hostel. I can not leave the hostel and I may have to stay with these 3 people for maybe 3 to 4 months more. I feel left out as the warden had completely broadcasted this issue and now everyones make me out to be the bad guy. My exams are coming and I am in no mood to study. Please help me.",1713187882.0,

For context I'm with my partner for 6 year now, living together but not legally married. When I met him he was active, no like I am, but he used to go to the gym, we would go to party's together, walk around town, basically we had a lot of fun. But since we moved in together he stopped taking care of himself, gained a lot of weight, we don't go out anymore, he stays most of his free time gamming and eating junk food, and our relationship got colder and colder, especially after I had a really bad episode of depression, and turn in just a shadow of myself, but I recover from that, and so our relationship... or so I thought 

We don't have fun as much anymore (that include our Sex life, we used to explore so much) and with time I accepted that this happens with married couples, and convinced myself that I was okay with this, since I Love him

Until a coworker hitted on me a few weeks ago, not uncommon, since I'm the only woman in the team on my shift, except that said coworker fits my ""type"", I cut that out, since he is also married, but this shaked me completely, I miss the fun, I miss the desire, I miss being young and I realized that I don't feel attracted to my partner anymore. 

I don't know what to do about that, I want to ask him to lose the weight, and I want the fun back again, but I don't know how to approach this, I ask him to go to the gym with me, he gave up after a month, I take him to parties, but he sits in a corner e keep scrolling his phone when there is no one he knows, he don't share the same interests as me anymore. I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose him, we share a life now, with three cats and a dog, I'm suspicious that he also have depression, but I can't help him, I insisted he goes to therapy, he says okay, but never go, I can't force him 

I'm seeking therapy because of how I felt after what my coworker said to me (he literally said to me ""whatever you want with me I'm in"" and I nearly caved) but I don't know how to help my boyfriend, or how to save our relationship, help me, please.

geornat,My life is going to be ruined in 10 days because of my mistake,36,1c44ks3,46,"I am 17 and living in the UK. Recently I started an application to join the navy. I did the test and scored extremely well, my parents were so proud of me for the first time in years. Then after completing some other stuff I did my interview, I passed and the person interviewing me said some great things about me making my parents even more proud. Now me and my friends used to smoke weed a lot last year but recently we slowed down and K was planning on quitting for the navy for obvious reasons. So after I told my friends I'd passed the interview, they wanted to celebrate with me because they were happy for me. So we drank and we all smoked for 'one last time' together. But thats the bad thing, I shouldn't have smoked. I go for my training in 10 days and they will drug test me there. It's going to show I have THC in my system and I'm going to be sent home immediately. My parents will be so angry and disappointed in me idk what I'm gonna do. And to make things even worse my dad joined the navy when he was my age but he got in trouble with the police right before going to his training aswell and was kicked out. Its history repeating itself.
So basically now im just waiting til everything is ruined, my parents have been treating me so well I can tell how proud they are, I have a 'huge congrats!' balloon in my room right now that they gave me. I've never seen them this proud before in my life. And its all going to be ruined from my mistake.

CorkyRamsbottom,Sexual shame: hiding my sexual desire,1,1c4qwye,0,"This has been bugging me for a while. I feel like I have a hole in my gut, right where my sacral chakra is. If you don't know where that is, it's a few inches below your belly button and represents sex and creativity.

My issue has to do with sex and a cutting off from all sexual desire.

I'm a straight guy and I was also really horny as a young man. At 15 years old, sex was my main focus. I found my brother's hardcore porno mag at age 13 and I was pretty obsessed.

I developed a relationship in high school as a bit of a manwhore. Porn was available then on the internet, so I was just completely out of control and driven by sex.

I'm sure that's not unusual at that age but here we are now.

I developed a lot of shame from my sexual exploits. I felt like I was looked upon negatively (maybe that's just in my head). And so I sort of shied away from being sexual.

Fast forward a few years with the MeToo movement and now I'm really afraid to show sexual interest in the opposite sex. So much so that now I hardly feel anything at all and this has resulted in the feeling that there's a hole in my stomach, like a pit.

It really sucks. I'm tense there all the time. My body is trying to tell me I need to heal my shame around sex and sexuality but I'm having a hard time. 

Sometimes I'm afraid if I let my sexuality come out more, I will lose control. I know it's not healthy to hide it, and it's really having an impact on my life, especially with dating. I feel weak or broken or that there's something wrong with me when I go on a date with girls. I can't help but wonder if she's thinking 'Why isn't he trying to kiss me' or 'Is he even interested in me? Maybe he's gay?' but I can't really bring it up, or don't bring it up with them because it's too uncomfortable and probably not something you would say to a girl you're interested in.

Anyway, this post is a first step in talking about it more, even if it's pretty anonymous.

Thanks for reading.

Due to work, she has to live separately with cousin #1 and monster however she often visit the big city to visit us.

One day, after few months living in a big city i found out that im still having that severe anxiety and i decided to meet with a physciatrist to help me overcome the anxiety. Since the anxiety that im currently having is severe, i need to call a family member to pick me up from the Hospital so i decided to call Aunt #2. She picks me from the Hospital and tells Aunt #1 about my mental health and Aunt #1 transfer us some money so that Aunt #2 can take me to shopping and relax my mind since thanksgiving is near. 

After shopping, Aunt #2 sending me back home. and cousin #1 already back to Aunt #1 for thanksgiving and i should be flying back to my hometown on the next day. When i arrived home, monster already knew about my anxiety condition. Aunt #2 already told him. So he wanted to massage me to help me relax, however i declined the offer and he force me to and i give him my hand and he continously to massage until he touched my private area and i told him to stop and i ran from him. he is sxually assaulting me, i called my parents and they told me to lock myself in the room and do not open the door until morning. My flight to my hometown is on 6 am and i need to get by the airport by 5 am. monster told me not too say any words to my parents about that. since im to scared to leave the room, i missed my flight, i arrived on 5.40 am at the airport. I called Aunt #2 to lend me some money because i need to get on the next flight. im too scared to be back to the monster.

Aunt #2 told me she also a victim from monster 13 years ago when she is get a job and decided  living together with them as Aunt #1 requests. She keep her mouth closed about the assaulting she had before because she did not want Aunt #1 and monster divorce. She also telling me to do the same. when i arrive at my hometown, i told my parents about that and my dad told me to quit my job and live again with them because it is really affecting my mental health so much. 

After thanksgiving, i fly back to the big city and decided to resign and tell my manager the truth and they suggest me to report to the police but i remember what Aunt #2 has told me to keep my mouth shut. They let me go, after work i am too afraid to back to the home where the monster is there, i bring my friends to accompany me and we packing all my stuffs and i get myself first plane go my hometown. i also sleeps at her house for that night.

Aunt #1 and cousin #1 is furious when they know that i leave their house without Aunt #1 consent. I just tell them sorry and blocked them. Now i am jobless and had to forget my dreams.

During christmas, they have the big family gathering and my family is invited except me. So i stayed at home while my dad and my mom go visit my grandparents. The monster is there, laugh happily like nothing had happened. Aunt #1 and cousin #1 hates me. My dad wants to tell Aunt #1 but im afraid as monster is manipulative. should i file a police report? or should i let Aunt #1 knows the truth? i miss her so much",1713185124.0,
Skrtskrtdowrk,Letter to burn ,2,1c4lay2,0,"This is the end. At this point we are distracting, and healing. You will always be Jane doe, and John does dad. How you decide to step up will be solely on you. 
Hopefully you do right for them and continue being there for them at least. I can’t make you want to stay and be present in their lives and miss time out on them. They will grow, John Doe already asks me questions, and I won’t be able to lie to him about you. 

I’ve done this a lot to be honest, as it keeps his happy thoughts alive for his dad. 


You say I cheated, and face it that was a scapegoat excuse to breakup with me. 

You’ve honestly left me a while ago. 

All the times you left me outside crying at your front door.
All the times you never stepped up to be a dad.
All the times you blocked me.
All the times you locked me out of the house. 
All the times I have felt unsafe next to you.

Locking me out that night with Jane Doe being only 3 months old as a breastfeeding mom really hurt me.

Having an officer tell me that you lied at Matt’s apartment and he knew it, really hurt me.

Kicking me out of your bed at Matt’s Apartment when I was pregnant over us arguing, because it was not my bed, I didn’t pay for it, really hurt me.


Having no privacy in your space really hurt me. 

All your insecurities you pushed onto me, that I will work on.

Breaking up with me.

Ghosting me.

You made me feel not good enough, or enough. 

You made me feel ugly as a women. 

Your small insults. You always talked about communication, and yet your choice of words turned out to be hurtful many times over. 

Not marrying me, which intentions and actions are different things and stringing me along.

 You knew how much that meant to me, but it never happened. 

Giving me a ring in my bags at a shelter. That hurt me. 

I hoped to be married at this point by now. I hoped for a lot of things by now. 

Moving to this state, in hopes of a better life and future crumbled way before Ethan came. 

All the micro aggressions that later turned to bigger issues. 

You too battled your pieces with me. 
I won’t invalidate your experience. 

 And like you said, I will too. 

I was not an angel. 
But WE stayed, and stayed, and stayed.


Thanks for breaking up with me. I did not have the strength to, due to deeper ideals of a “nuclear” family, and because I loved you. 

I cried the other day, because after all this time I’ve came to accept that our love was Toxic. The dependency of this cycle was real. 

I had many good points and highs with you. 

I had unforgettable moments with you. 
Thanks for bringing those caveats of quality into my life in knowing you. 

You let me peak into your soul and those moments will forever stay with me. 
We gave each other two kids, and I will love them with all I have. 


I have love for you and I always will to be honest. Though I am not in love with you, it does not affect the love I have for you. 


I am sorry we did not make it through it all. I am sorry that you fought Internally for so long. 

In the end, our love did not win. 

In the end there is much self work to be done.

We both settled for less, boundaries crossed, love abused, and moments robbed. 

I wish you all the best in all that you do. 
I will always be rooting for you from afar. 

You are John Doe and Jane Doe’s dad, which means a lot to me. 

I want you to flourish, heal, grow, and enjoy your life. 
You only get one. Go love it, love yourself, and live it. 

That may seem hard as you face a lot of decisions and work things out. But you will be fine, and you will succeed in all that you do. 

I hoped you would be there for me to graduate. I have a promising future for our family. 

Many nights I have cried, I’m sure you have to. 

7 years is a long time to spend with someone. We gave it a good run Fishy. 

I have a lot of work to do in a lot of areas in my life. 

 Being a single mom with our kids, and you not being here is daunting. But the reality is you’ve left me for awhile to be a mom and dad. I am just scared. 


It is an attachment to you that you will be here and make all the pain go away. 

I hope that when you read this you do feel I am expressing from a genuine space. 

You were my dream guy. On all levels my fishy. The stars won’t shine the same anymore, they haven’t for awhile now.

But they will once I heal.

All my energy and time will be on our kids now to make their world as peaceful as possible. 

Unfortunately, our story ends now. 

You will take and have a piece of my heart and soul with you. But I knew that from the moment I decided to move to WA with you. 



Thank You for sharing your love with me, memories, time together and our kids.

Indigo-Firefly,I have no idea who I am,1,1c4qkug,0,"Every day I feel like a new person. I oscillate between new ambitions and identities like a roller coaster. If it were something as simple as feeling extroverted one day and shy the next, I could deal with it. But it's things like... for a few days I'll feel like I'm transgender, and it feels so real. The next day, I'll throw myself into religious dogma and act super puritan. I'll decide my true passion is music, and I will write a musical that will change the world. (Despite having no background in music.) I went to college for accounting until I dropped out after a mental breakdown when I started hating it. I never liked math, why did I even start? My political and moral leanings flip flop with no conviction. I have likely hundreds of accounts on various sites because I always feel the need to start fresh when I discover my ""true"" self.

I feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't want to start anything because I know I won't stick with it. I'm stuck in retail because I'm afraid to go back to college. I'm scared I'll die never being a real person.

Makksie,I turned 30 and no one in my friends' group remembered. Celebrated alone with my 4 days old baby that no one offered to visit yet.,317,1c3padj,69,"A week ago I gave birth to my first kid, shared the news the next day on the group chat, everyone whished us well but no one offered to help/visit us soon.

On the other hand my boyfriend did the same and shared the news with the people he knows, and already most of his friends have offered to come by if we'd like, to check in on us, help us cook, bring groceries or just chill and chat.

Last night I turned 30. It's a big deal to me because as I was bullied for years on end at school, had the birthday parties where nobody came, etc, the whole thing; I always feel vulnerable on this day. I need people to send some wishes to be reassured. So for sure 30 hits on another level, especially after witnessing most of my friends going through it and always having big parties, lots of whishes, gifts from us all, etc. Well in the end only my parents and my sister sent something.
To be fair, I was not completely alone since my childhood best friend had flowers delivered to me, which softened the blow, my boyfriend went out to get me all my favorite foods and a bottle of champagne for dinner, and of course my baby brings me so much joy.
But I still cried all night long.

Like, there I was, 4 days postpartum, going through the rough of hormonal levels dive, sleep deprived, still unable to walk from stitches, left with a floppy belly and 50 pounds to lose, crying in my maternity diapers, turning 30 at one of the most vulnerable moments of my life and no one to ask how I was or think about me on this day. It feels SO pathetic.

I just needed to write this because I can't keep crying about it all alone. Is it normal ? Am I right in thinking my relationships with these people are very one sided ?

How do you make new friends at 30 with a smol baby ?

Edit : I mentioned my family, friend and bf doing nice things precisely because I acknowledge it and appreciate it deeply. YET I can't help but feel devastated by the absence of interest in either how am I doing after giving birth or my 30th birthday from the people I've talked to and loved every day for the past 10 years.
Not saying it's logical, rational or anything. I needed to get this off my chest, that's why I'm here.
I'm not telling any of those 4 people that did nice things for me any of this. I only told them again and again how much it meant to me in this period and how much I loved them.

Adding this edit cause I'm getting hateful DMs telling me that I'm a spoiled brat and there are worst things in life (I know it, do I need to tell you about my whole life to be valid in sometimes also going through silly stuff ?).
I sure hope the people you know never have to deal with baby blues, post partum depression, emotional vulnerability or any kind of mental dysfunction and confide in you just to be told they're huge turds for feeling feelings.",1713085716.0,
SeekingS0ul,I saw my friend’s panties,0,1c55nfw,5,"I have this friend, let call her Amy (39F). She came to my place for a vacation for two weeks. My girlfriend and I were happy to have her and show her around. I have known her for about 20 years. We went to college together and there were many guys after her. I knew she was good looking and smart, but never really caught my interest other than just being good friends. 

During her stay, she was reading her book and talking about what she likes and what she’s been doing. I couldn’t help to notice that she was wearing this tight sweat pants and light fabric pants. They really complemented her body. It was until then that I realized she had a nice and very round butt. Many times it looked like she wasn’t wearing panties. I couldn’t help to take a look at Amy’s butt whenever possible.  Idk why I never noticed while we were in school. 

On her last Saturday night, Amy asked my gf if she could do the laundry for her early the next morning as she was planning to stay up late. She did not want the sound of the washer and dryer to wake everyone up. My gf put Amy’s clothes in the washer and she forgot to place it in the dryer. I asked my gf if she was going to move Amy’s clothes. I didn’t wanna touch her clothes as I assumed Amy did not want me to see her underwear. My gf said I could do it. When I was moving the clothes, I saw Amy’s panties and they looked so cute and small. Many thoughts came to my mind at that moment. I imagined her wearing those panties and how they would go in between her butt cheeks 

I still remember those panties. I liked what I saw, but I feel bad because it ruined my view of my friend. I never told my gf but I assume she knows I saw Amy’s underwear ",1713236570.0,

Since my wife and I had our little baby, we've been a little deprived of sleep. It's getting better now as she's almost two months old. I've been dreaming about peeing a lot, and in my dreams, when I start peeing, I just can't stop and it takes a long time to stop.

Having said that, when I'm in deep sleep, I wet the bed. It's just a little bit, but noticeable. If I go a long time without ejaculations, I'll probably end up ejaculating in bed too, which also happened after the postpartum period.

I am not going to shill for Israel. I don’t have a dog in this fight. I am completely and utterly fed up of world leaders instigating psychotic conflicts that most often affect countless innocent civilians. But hey, if Israel and Iran’s governments want to blow up the Middle East, be my guest. I just want no part in it. 

Of course ultimately I want peace for everyone and I sympathise with the citizens of Israel, Iran and the Palestinians who have been suffering for months. But I can’t force this peace to happen. So I don’t want our lives, money and resources poured into another potential conflict that HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REGULAR PEOPLE LIVING HERE. If I want resources sent to the Middle East, send it for humanitarian purposes. No new offensives, attacks and escalations. I am sick of it. The only people profiting off of starting a potential war are the people who never get hurt by war themselves. Send all the world leaders to fight amongst themselves, and be done with it.

Hot-Depth5599,Just ranting about social skills and stuff,1,1c4pm9w,0,"I have been a pretty socially-awkward person for a long time, I can't remeber not having problems making friends except when I still was a child but I believe that happens, to some extent, to most people.  
I remember times when I had one or two friends to having no friends at all but in the last few years I managed to be a bit more ""socially active"" and making more friends, still not many but an improvement is always an improvement.

It's not like excluding those few friends I hate everybody else... I try my best to help others as much as I can and make a good impression. I have good relations with most people I know but we know each other and that's it I don't think of them as my friends nor I believe they think of me as a friend.

Honestly, it's not that bad and I'm satisfied about my social life and I've been like that for the last few years (when I made new friends). But I noticed how easily this satisfaction can disappear because of my insecurities.

It happened firstly last year when I was chatting with one of my friends (I still consider him a friend of mine but we now see each other very rarely and so we're slowly drifting apart) and, after I said he was weird for something I won't dive into right now he responded with something along the line of ""You're the one who said having 4 friends was much!"". That hurt me as it reminded me I still don't have many friends. I didn't talk to that friend for a week or something like that (before we used to talk almost daily) and then we went on like nothing happened (I beleieve that interaction may have played a role in our drifting away from each other).

What drove me to write this post is another similar episode that happened just yesterday. This following few weeks along with the last one I had quite a lot of social events to attend and, being the super introvert I am they made me anxious, especially one: a birthday party I was invited to. I hadn't been invited to one for the longest time if we exclude one a few years ago when only 4 people attended... What made me even more anxious about that is that the person who invited me isn't one of my close friends nor they know any of them to my knowledge. Going to a birthday party with none of my friends to stick close to sounded pretty bad. I was afraid I was going to spend the entire party in a corner watching others without saying a word so I decided to talk about it to my slighly-less awkward friends with disastrous feedbacks:

The first just (he's always been a bit edgy) straight up laughed and said: ""You are alone and antisocial (quick note here I'm not sure I antisocial has a medical connotation in English, it isn't my first language but in my language antisocial has no medical condition it's just a person who doesn't have many friends nor likes making new ones), but you are moving in the right direction"" I know it was an attempt at saying something like ""you got this"" or ""You should totally go to the party, no matter what, it'll help you!"" but it felt so bad... Especially since he isn't much better than me when it comes to making friends, (I don't believe this will compromise our relationship like what happened last year did, we're much closer than how I was with the other guy and we've had quite a lot of disagreements in the past, and we both got over all of them)

The second one was kind of on a rush because he said the minimum needed to sound like he cared before saying he had to go. It also kinda felt bad but I understand he may have had stuff to do.

I wanted to ask my best friend too, he's probably even more socially awkward than me and he hates going to parties more than I do (he went to the 18th birthday of a classmate of his last year and he said something like ""I went just because he's my friend and it's his 18th birthday, but I hated it"") but he too was on a rush today.

I don't know the ""You are alone and antisocial"" hit hard... I know I'm not alone, I do have friends but just today I was thinking, what if I'm missing out on life always avoiding all those PROMs and parties like that... Am I wasting my ""best years""? I have so much to do but I was left pondering on this for hours...

Well, thank you for taking the time to read all this and sorry if it's written like shit English isn't my first language :D

Nothingmuchguy,"My girlfriend always gives me ""homework""",1,1c4pl33,6,"I have been with my gf for 3 years (we are 28y.o.), living together almost 2. She is super well organised person, smart as hell and a perfectionist. These are at the same time things that I love about her but can get annoying sometimes...

She always plans things in advance, meals, trips, things to do, etc. Again, on the one hand, this is good so that we dont waste time and money but nothing is really spontaneous I guess.

I am more of a person who likes to just improvise a lot of things - comparison when I was living alone, I bought once a week things that I like from store and then cook meals every day and then try to make something from whatever was left by the end of the week - now we (mostly she) plan the meals in advance and then buy the ingredients.

Now here is the thing: She always tells me when I should buy something as it is discounted and at which store and when is the cupon day etc. Always of course something that is just on my way to somewhere or from somewhere, usually for stores that I have on my way from work. She really hates spending more money if there is a chance to get it discounted. I get it, thats why I dont think I am in right here, but damn I would just love to go in any store when I have some time and buy whatever regardless if it is discounted or not. And also sometimes after work I just wanna go home and relax a bit and then do the chores.

I did talk to her and she gets upset as of course she is right that this is optimal for our time and money and basically I would be throwing money and time away just because I am lazy.

And not planning the cooking only works for me as she is a bit picky about food (mostly likes a lot of veggies and cant really eat a heavy meal) so when there are only leftovers or limited ingredients to make something from them, she usually doesnt like the meal.

And again, I gotta give her credit, she mostly cooks as she comes home a bit earlier than me and she cooks really tasty meals! So I really have no right to complain about anything, her plan and way of doing things is actually better than mine, objectively speaking.

But I do feel like a child a lot of times because she basically plans everything for us (except travels - I love to do that) and always tells me what would be the best way for me to do something or what I should do and when will be the ""most optimal"" time and place to do it.

I just wanna do nothing and do stuff less optimally and throw away that precious time and money for stupid shit like going to store later or buying bananas on wednesday and not friday...

redditlurker48ic,My mom is threatening to cut me off over a room I never use.,0,1c4phny,7,"My (20F) mom (48F) is threatening to cut me off over a room I never use. My parents and younger brother live an hour away, as I'm currently in a different city for college. My parents have been paying for most if not everything while I focus on studies, something my mother absolutely insists on. Multiple times I have offered and asked to get a job not only to try and cover some costs of my own, but also to get some financial independence and income ahead of time, and every single time was told absolutely not.

Now, my mother is angry that my room at their house isn't spotlessly clean. I go home every other week for a single night, showing up on Saturday and leaving Sunday morning. A majority of the time I spend there I am studying and doing schoolwork still, and have not had a break to myself since the semester began.

She, my father and my brother returned from out of town this weekend, after I had to wake up at 7am still on the weekend to take care of the dogs and cats because they didn't feel like paying someone, and because I didn't clean ""my"" room and move an object my mom put in  there for me, she is threatening that if the next time I am home the room is not spotlessly clean to her impossible standards, I will be financially cut off immediately.

I understand on one hand that yes I use the room, but her entire reasoning for doing this is because her and my father want to replace the carpet with hardwood, a project they started 3 years ago when I was in high school that I had cleaned my room and moved my furniture to prepare for and they simply didn't do it.

So now I'm stuck trying to suddenly prepare for this financial weight that they refused to let me start preparing for years ago (and even a month ago when I told my mother I'd be applying for a position at a local bookstore that she threatened me not to take). I feel lost, confused, hurt and extremely angry especially since it isn't even that big of a fucking deal. I have no plan in place, nowhere to go and no one to ask for help from because my friends are not in a financial space that I would feel comfortable asking any of them for help or letting any of them know what's going on since they'd feel obligated to help and then put themselves at risk. 

I have about 8.5k in an investment account from my grandma who passed and about 1.3k in my checking that I'm glad I saved for a rainy day, but now in the rush for a job that money will all go down the drain faster than I could possibly imagine. There's no way I will be able to make it through the month since my parents forced me into a 2-bedroom apartment for college so my brother could move in, and the rent is 1.4k per month. My college costs are even higher per semester not to mention I will be in my masters program next year. I will be homeless. I will likely die. I have no resources and no chance of making it through the summer since I refuse to go home for her to start trying to charge me for the resources I'd use there.

I just can't believe my mother is choosing her want for a clean room over her daughter's literal life, because already I am mentally struggling and barely holding together without all of this on top of it, and I truly don't know how long I'll be able to last before I genuinely just can't do it anymore. I've already had thoughts about a world without me in it, and I know that those will only get worse these next few months and I truly don't think I'm strong enough to survive it.

My only positive right now is that I wrote down my social security number years ago in high school because I needed it for financial aid applications for scholarships. My mother has all my documents including my birth certificate and most medical records, and I'm luckily established with a doctor so I could get the medical records myself, but otherwise I genuinely think I am fucked and that I'll have to come to terms with my likely homelessness within the next few months.

I just needed to vent about this all, because I'm currently at an unpaid internship for my schooling and genuinely have no clue where to go from here. I don't know if any advice really can be offered other than get a job which I am already looking into, but I'm also worried that my mom will steal funds from my bank account since she has access to it. My investment account from my grandmother is protected since my name and I think maybe my dads is on the account and I doubt he'll let her go too far, but I don't know if he'll stop her from completely cutting me off and if he agrees with her or not, but my mother using money and my old cat who lives at that house over my head isn't uncommon.

Could that count as financial/emotional abuse? Maybe. It doesn't matter anyways. I have to go now to try and pull myself together before a staff meeting at this internship, but any advice and help is appreciated.",1713195974.0,

They are all the nicest people from what I’m about to tell you I took a break off social media while back as I was going through some personal struggles and when I took this break I didn’t exactly tell anyone because I was in the quiet of a bad mindset and most of them are pretty hurt and I still don’t know why exactly why I did apologise for treating them badly for my mental health Like I knew there was times where I wasn’t the best friend and I feel very guilty but I’ve had problems with these people in the past. They can be very toxic and they can make everything about yourself. They can turn every single your own drama into there as that makes sense, cut they all decide to hang out without me today and I am very hurt. There’s no words to describe her. I was because I was going to contact with all of them again or the ones I didn’t see at school because most of the homeschool but not to say anything. I didn’t find out it was because I didn’t go on my phone for a few hours but two of them posted about hang out today and so many emotions for me. I was confused so angry. Just I felt like I was going crazy. Like what did I do to deserve this? I could never imagine actually doing this to someone only. I’m sorry and I understand that you’re hurt and angry, but it wasn’t up to me and I hope you’re well away I don’t even have any words anymore. I am so mad at all of them.

Aggravating_Ear_4873,I was the scapegoat and parentified elder daughter (actually granddaughter) Even after nearly 2 decades of leaving my neglectful abusive family I still feel bitter. Life is better now but the rage of being cheated of my potential burns my soul,1,1c4pbaj,2,"After my mother died when I was 11 my maternal grandmother who until before my mother’s death was the best grandmother but after I became kind of her problem (my father was an abusive asshole) she kind of did a total flip over. Suddenly she was cold and non-communicative. 

  
The only time she’d be all sweet and honey was when my maternal uncle’s kids would be dropped over for free babysitting. There were 2 of them (boy and girl) and were from the time they were toddlers till they reached 4 years or so until they began school. I felt sorry for them then as their mother was only interested in her career so they’d cling to me.

  
I had to take care of them but was never given anything in lieu of my services even the goodies the father brought for his kids were exclusively for them. Like a forlorn waif, I’d look on while they ate the most expensive fruits, etc because that uncle was quite well-off.  In fact, the POS would make fun of my clothes and say my hands were like a man's.

  
It’s only now I realize that uncle was a horrible bully. This over having to deal with the loss of my mother was really very traumatizing.  
  
I had to repress my rage towards my uncle so as not to be cruel to my cousins. I really tried being a good Christian.  
  
With all this emotional repression and burden of res on my shoulders I developed scoliosis while these two kids went on to have quite successful careers (the girl became a successful model).

  
Once when my son’s father was dying with cancer I asked for help and they gave me 10$ and left. I've not seen them since

  
 I still burn at the injustice of my life. If I’d known that good deeds are not rewarded or appreciated, I’d have behaved differently

She's very healthy, so we're on the same levels in terms of physical strength and vitality right now. 
We met at a cannabis lounge, where I told her that I DJ in VR but never really engaged in the IRL raving scene like her, and she invited me to my first rave! I fell in love with plur culture and it became a regular thing for us to go out raving together once or twice a week, and it's through these experiences that I fell for her. We regularly shower eachother with little heartfelt gifts and call eachother in our free time to just chat for hours, hell I've even got keys to her place! She introduced me to mushrooms, I eventually tried a heroic dose and had an ego death that snapped me out of chronic depression and helped me come to terms with my mortality. I strongly believe that we are soulmates, but it violates even my own moral code to take things any farther, so I just pray that we'll meet again in another life and keep things in limbo between us. But I just can't look at anyone else the same way so I choose to just tell everyone I'm just not interested in dating anymore, which is technically true!

BelleLovesAngus,Ride or Die friendship turned to NC,2,1c4jufs,0,"My cousin and I have been thick as thieves since we were young. We are only a year apart. We used to get the same presents, wear the same things, and people even would get us confused. We grew up together and as we got older, we could set off on our own adventures and I could see her whenever I wanted instead of having to wait until a family gathering or school holidays (she lived over an hour away). During college, I would stay over her house for days at a time and we would study together, cook dinner together, have lunch together, and hang out together all the time. Those days I was in a really dark place and she took me in and cared for me. She had the best moral compass. She cared so deeply for the people in her life and her convictions to care for them were so strong, anything that looked like going above and beyond from the outside was normal to her. I moved away to another city a few years ago to pursue my career (not many opportunities in my home city). She was super excited for me, but we were both sad too. But every couple of months I would fly back to visit and would often stay at her place (difficult situation with my parents). Even though I lived away, we still kept in touch and when I'd return, I was always welcomed back with excitement and love. I honestly have never felt so valued. But when covid hit, things just completely shifted. I was actually in the same city visiting my Dad after my grandmother had passed and got stuck in the city, unable to return home to my new city. But contact had just stopped. I don't know what happened. I asked her if there was anything wrong, if I had something to upset her. I asked her if it's because I stayed with Dad that time instead of staying with her, if asking her if she was going to our uncle's funeral was upsetting her (Found out at the funeral that uncle and her dad had beef - I had no idea), if it was because of restrictions that I couldn't see her. She basically answered yes to all, but none of them were the biggest issue. But she said she needed to tell me in person. Then, nothing but christmas, new Year, and birthday greetings every year. In every one of my messages, I communicated wanting to sort out what happened. Telling her I missed her. She would thank and show remnants of what she used to be like, but nothing else. I had been patient and trusted in our friendship that she would eventually reach out. After two more Christmas messages, I told her that I was upset and confused about it, but if she wasn't in a space to talk about it, that was fine. No response. I reached out for her birthday. Giving her another chance, but allowing her more time. She said to not think that this was about me and what I did, and how it's about her. But this was over 2 years since things changed. Since then, she would always message that we ""should meet up <insert arbitrary time frame here>"". But whenever I asked about specific dates, she never actually proposed concrete plans. I didn't want to push. I was the one in the wrong. I wasn't about to demand answers. This year, I finally proposed this place that is closer to her, that I go every once in a while. We made a date, and then she pulled out last minute. Something about a boss who was micromanagy and caused her anxiety booked a meeting that caused her a lot of anxiety. I am no stranger to anxiety from micromanagers, so I understood but asked for a replacement date. She said she's busy for the next couple of weeks, and then the upcoming holiday 2 months afterwards, but after that holiday she would be free. Cut to about a month after that holiday. Still nothing.

I sent her a long message tonight about how I previously wanted to fix whatever I did. That I would  have done anything for our friendship. I would not let anything, especially my ego get in the way. But I was not given a chance to try. I said I didn't understand why it had gone for this long. Why things just disappeared after more than 3 years. How I gave out chances and tried to be patient and give her space. But how much space is really needed after practically 4 years? I told her I was done. She had 4 years to reach out but she took 0 chances. I can't help but feel she threw everything away for a reason unknown to me. Now I feel like there's this huge gaping hole. It feels worse than a breakup. We have years upon years of memories. We grew up together. But nothing big or significant happened. It wasn't drifting apart like other friendships. There was a literal stop. A definitive moment. And then nothing but heartbreaking emptiness. I am heartbroken. Having to call someone out who was literally my ride or die for so much of my life, sucks.

And, yeah, the maintenance needed for living requires labor — to build shelter, to make food, to counteract the entropic decay of our bodies, the whole thing. This is not even a “capitalism bad” post, because while you can imagine other ways of structuring society that would diminish the quantity of labor-per-person needed, as long as you don’t have stuff like Star Trek replicators, some amount of work is needed.

I don’t weight that much, but he’s a fitness freak; always worrying about what food we have in the house, always making off-hand comments when I indulge, even if it’s just some ice cream on a night out, or a drink after a long day. 

It’s been like that for the several months we dated, and beyond the topic of my weight / fitness, he’s usually pleasant to be around and funny. I just kinda put up with it. 

But the other day, after a heated fight, he gave me an ultimatum: I can either listen to him about my weight and get skinny so I can be “pretty,” or he was done. He said he thought of me as an “investment,” but since I wasn’t getting “better,” I wasn’t “paying off.” I told him I didn’t want to be with someone who didn’t think I was already beautiful, and so we ended things.

FunkMaster96,Pretty sure I’m a sociopath…,4,1c4fy9o,9,"- I hardly care about anything:
       - A while back I hit rock bottom and it made me realize that 95% of my friends are fair weather friends. I was originally going to say that they’re fake friends, but then realized that we’re just acquaintances.
       - Genetic family. I often times wish I was adopted. I don’t wish them any ill… it’s just indifference. 
       - Love Life. Basically what happens is that we date until they inevitably dump me (I’m always the dumpee) and I stop caring. My guess is that we had more of a brotherly/ sisterly type relationships. I cared more about the dates in my head/ imaginary friend…
         - A year ago, I went on like 100 first dates. Lots of physical attraction, but never felt ‘romantic love.’
         - My country. I see so many people who are proud to be American, and they waive American flags, and sing its glory. I’m a bi ethnic person - a middle easter one. Not sure if it’s like this for all bi ethnic people, or just the middle eastern ones, but I feel like an ‘Uncle Tom.’ I mainly just say nothing when this stuff comes up - I wasn’t one of the lucky ones to get rights n stuff. When people ask, “Yah I’m American. Not really proud or ashamed of it. It’s just the only citizenship I have/ was given.” I don’t wanna move to the other ethnicity country because the middle east is mostly muslim. You can’t really escape the religion there.

Why do I not say psychopath? I’m one of the most upstanding citizens in the USA. I pay my taxes, pick up my dog’s poop, do everyone right etc. I don’t own any guns or ever wish to own one, don’t like macho things like the UFC. 

Things I care about summed up: 
- Only family member I love is our dog. 
- A few guy friends from over the years.
- My employees. I keep them at an arm’s distance tho. 
- The idea of falling in love - I wanna find someone to care about but not sure if this is posibble . 

Basically, my world consists of like 10-15 people and a dog, plus another ~25 or so employees. (The employees love me cuz of how well I run the ship/ pay but we wouldn’t really talk to each other if they weren’t my employees). Don’t think I’ll ever have children either. Only once in my life did I ever think “I should have kids w/ this person.” It didn’t work out…

So now I’m wondering: “What now?” I have self realization. Is the answer to ‘find another sociopath and i’ll finally fall in love and want kids?’ or is to ‘just accept it, run in circles till death’ or some third option?

I am a woman from a conservative area and am involved in organized religion. Despite these things I have an unconventional sense of style and world views.

I have very short hair, a masculine face, and I dress in a lot of eccentric outfits most of which lean towards being less feminine. I also go by a more masculine name.  Based on how I look, I am immediately assumed to be lesbian, transgender, or nonbinary. I am constantly asked my pronouns and always end up in conversations about gender identity. 

This is usually always done in a very polite and supportive way. I haven’t been treated badly for my style or behavior. I am generally encouraged and complimented on my sense of style, and everyone who asks me these questions generally do it out of a genuine desire to make me comfortable. 

Thing is, their efforts are wasted on me. I’m straight and cis, and I couldn’t give a flying frick about pronouns. I think the very idea of feminine and masculine is dumb. I’ve never understood what people mean when they say they feel like a man or a woman how the hell do you FEEL like a gender? I just feel like me and I do what I want. Call me he she they or it, and I don’t mind. Just pick something that makes you happy and as long as you’re nice to me I’ll be cool with it. 

I have no skin in the gender game. It’s something I don’t care about, but it ends up being a huge part of my interaction with other people. Mostly I just end up feeling bad because they are waisting all of their effort on someone who could give less of a care. Somewhere out there there is some poor kid who just wishes someone would ask them their pronouns, and here I am getting asked left and right when I couldn’t care less. I have a coworker who gets hugely embarrassed when she calls me by the name on my name plate and not the one on my badge, but it doesn’t matter to me. I only requested this name because I think it sounds cooler than my real name.
But out there there is someone who wishes people would put in effort to calling them their chosen name.

I get my pronouns asked at my super conservative church? Like, what? There are hundreds of people out there struggling with bullying or being ostracized by their family, and here I am being treated super nicely in a super conservative area and it’s all wasted on me just because I’m a little butch.

My grandparents were disappointed my cousin is gay, yet somehow when I show up to church dressed like a man they don’t bat an eye. I am actually the favorite grandchild despite doing none of the things they approve of?

But as we got older, when I was around 11 years old, he started hating me. He accused me of being the favourite( which is not true at all since my mom admitted to loving him more than me) just because my dad defended me from him. He would refuse to let me talk and would get furious when I did. He would ignore me for days and if I ever got on his nerves, he would physically abuse me. I have never told anyone about it since I didn't want him to feel bad. He would apologize and then do it again. 

Recently, we had a big fight during the dinner table for not reason at all. He just started calling me names, and said I sucked off my dad, that im disrespectful to my mom(i have no idea as to why) and that I'm disgusting and stuff like that. He went on and on, and we had guess over so everyone saw it. My parents tried to shut him up but I was so shocked I started crying. All because I said I wanted to go blueberry picking with my parents. They always hang around my brother to soothe him and make sure he doesn't snap. I've never spent time with them for a whole day since the start of this year.

I forgave him after the fight but for some odd reason he still hated me. My mom tried to make us get along but he said he didn't want anything to do with me. I feel so hurt, I bought him gifts, comforted him when he was getting into fights with my parents or his friends and I always defended him. I tried my best to get along with him because I genuinely loved him but I realized that he never loved me. He loves my parents but not me. I dont know what's wrong with me, but I feel so empty.

It has been a good experience so far, we communicate well, try to learn each other’s love languages, ensure to make each feel like a priority. We have established a strong connection and honestly it has been a very healthy relationship compared to my previous abusive cheating relationships. He is an excellent partner- understands my needs, efficient, diligent, caring. Although its been more than over a year since we started dating, we do see a future together. However our respective backgrounds come from different communities in our home country, with his being perceived as higher and mine as lower. While i personally don’t place importance on such distinctions in relationships, the reality in our society is that my community faces significant stigma, including violence and discrimination akin to racism in the USA. My boyfriend is unaware of my background, I haven’t disclosed it not because I am ashamed where i come from, but simply because I dont see it as a huge deal. A few weeks back we were having a brief conversation about communities that revealed his preconceived notions about my community. He doesn’t have problematic views but they do hint that he is also sort of buying the narrative of the hierarchy. I am apprehensive about disclosing my identity because the thought of having a conversation with him after having a brief idea about his views is unsettling for me. He tried to tone it down since he is aware that my moral compass with respect to politics is very uptight. While i don’t nt expect him to a social warrior and accept me from coming from a certain community, i am little icky about the potential complications with our families and larger society in general. It is obviously not going to be an easy road. I am also anxious about dealing with the feelings of someone rejecting me as a life partner solely based on my community and honestly i am not ready or prepared to endure a heartache. All my previous relationships have been extremely toxic, physically and verbally abusive. For the first time ever I am in a healthy relationship. I am also diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and all these feelings are extremely heavy right now. I feel emotions on an intense level and struggle quite a bit. This situation weighs heavily on me, not just in a romantic relationship but also within my social circle, where this stigma persists.

Affectionate-Pie9340,Nervous breakdown ,5,1c4dyel,4,"I'm coming undone at the seams as I type this... have you ever been so angry and betrayed you start laughing while your crying.? I am so flooded with emotions and sadness if I don't touch ground here soon I'm going to snap literally physically and emotionally.....


7 years... 7 FUCKING YEARS I stayed loyal to the most evil cruel ABUSIVE sneaky lying FUCK...

7 YEARS... and he completely destroyed me financially mentally and physically... but he was soooo smooth about it, THATS WHATS EATING ME MOST... thw fact that I havr never been tricked before i can sense peoples motives immediately not because of some magical gift but because i had to growing up in the environment i did.

For the first 2 years he was PERFECT.. he convinced me to quit my job pack up ALL my belongings (most of which I had to put in storage) and move 11 hours away from home.  I sold my car because he said he had another one up north for me and at that time the money seemed worth it to sell then to keep. 


AT FIRST it was HE was perfect... He told me to take my time finding a job and that all he expected in return was for me to follow him while he worked (construction) SO I DID... HAPPILY. it was the first time in 30 years I had been in love like actually head over heels IN LOVE. I would of walked on glass barefoot across the world for this man..  

His jobs took him to different places so for the first 2 years we bounced around and lived in long term hotels... 

I made sure where ever we were I made it home for us. Made him dinner every night packed his lunches and spread my legs whenever he asked. 

And then we had our first fight.. over something so stupid, I couldn't help but ignore the writting on the wall.. 

He accused me of staring at some guy while we were out to dinner, which never in a trillion years would I ever do, even if I didn't like the person I was with, I'm just not that type of person, in fact I'm incredibly insecure in public and pretty much keep my head down anyways, but because I guess some guy was staring at me...in his mind that mean that I was obviously staring back. 


After that things changed... little by little at first.. little demands he'd ask of me.. get a phone plan with him, let him hold onto my money not wear certain things etc etc... which at the time seemed like not a big deal, I mean I loved the guy so who cares as long as it made him happy and feel secure. 


Then he finally gets a big job (2-3yrs) it would span so we start looking for places go actually rent.. 
We rent a home he buys me a car(that later he would cause me to crash and almost die in) (along with getting it in my name and not making any payments on it without me knowing)

I don't even know what happened these last few years except for the beatings got worse the control got worse and I got worse...

I was now completely dependent on him for everything and there was no way I could crawl out of the hole, because he just kept digging me in deeper.. 

And now 7 years later.. 2 cracked ribs zero money zero identity and zero clue what to do next, he has decided to discard me.. 

He's left me in a home he stopped paying rent for and like an idiot I signed my name on the lease for.
No car. No money no food. and I don't know a single person out here.. I don't have any family, except 2 brothers who live in different states. And the friends I had back home... well it's been 7 years that I wasn't ""allowed"" to see them so I can't ask any of them for help... 

So what now.. he ruined me. I used to always be able to land back on my feet no matter what... but this time I feel like I had my legs chopped off and the rug ripped out from underneath me... 

Anyways I'll probably off myself tonight.. seems like the only logical thing to do. I'm not asking for people's sympathy... I'm the fucking idiot who allowed it to happen to give everything up so it's my fault and I take complete responsibility for it... but God damn do I feel stupid and I truly truly hate myself for it. 

The worst part, I don't even hate him... I just hate what he was to me. 

That's all

I need a lot of alone time and as mentioned before, I don’t wanna have sex that often as I can’t even orgasm. I’d be having to sacrifice my sanity to be in a relationship with most men. There’s also the fact that I’m kind of a loser so it’s not like anybody would wanna be with me anyways.

throwawayinterwhat,My boyfriend and I are killing our relationship lol,1,1c4m8w0,7,"When we met we were both in shape and had semi-active lives; he has always been into sport, and staying fit/healthy, but had taken a long pause for health concerns.
I have never been sporty and hate exercising, but I walked/cycled a lot bc of my lifestyle so I was not doing so bad. I got a lot better in having healthier habits thanks to him, but the exercising is really not sticking. I always stop after a while.
 
About a year ago my mental health took a harsh decline, I had finished school and I didn’t get out of the house for months. I gained 15kgs (33 lbs). He had troubles so he stopped school, and suddenly wanted to get his old body back so he decided to put his focus on exercising and getting more fit.

2-3 months in, he told me he had lost attraction towards me but said it was because he felt we weren’t as connected emotionally anymore, and that he still wanted to stay together. I accepted it bc I was too dependent emotionally. We worked on it and grew closer but tbh things have not been the same since then. My self esteem had taken the biggest hit and was at its lowest. 

Its been about 10 months since that. Now, I am doing a lot better. Mental health is good. I’ve worked on myself and I can confidently say I find myself pretty, and I think I look good. I haven’t lost the weight but it’s definitely stabilized, I eat healthy. It’s just not gone because I am not focusing my energy on that. I am also less attached to my bf, it might be sad but its healthier this way. 

Being intimate is a touchy subject. It took time to build the trust back, for me to gain enough confidence to even be wanting it, etc. We finally got there like 4 months ago, and let me tell you, things went bad again fast 😀 its always awkward. We tried 4 times 💀

I tried talking about it and now he says he has issues with me “not taking care of my body” (if you ask me, this was the root of the issue from a year ago). He said that I seem to only care about skincare/haircare and anything under my head does not concern me. I found that very hurtful because I pour so much love into myself. That was the only way for me to regain self esteem. I may not go to the gym but I really push to have a healthier lifestyle. And deep down, one of my biggest reasons for avoiding the gym is because he’s been pressing me to go and to do diets and I hate it. I hate the fact that I might do this for a man and not because I really want it. I have always been this way and when we met +2 years ago, I was even less in shape than I am right now. So I don’t think that he’s being truthful when he says its the lack of “active-ness”. It’s the added weight.

And I can understand not being attracted to bigger persons, but I dont think changing who I am for him will be beneficial. I have not gained weight to the point of not being able to do things anymore. It took me so much effort and time to love myself again after he had told me to my face that he couldn’t even kiss me bc it felt too uncomfortable. I am not letting him destroy it again.

With the confidence I have right now, I would have broken up with him back then, with the things he had told me. But I am not blaming myself for staying. It’s not like he wanted to break up, and I honestly was dependent on him throughout my depressive episode. Breaking up would have killed me 💀 it was not an option.

I have never cared for him being active. I do have a preference for bigger people, but him deciding to lose the weight is not a problem for me. He’s been losing a lot and I am happy that he is reaching his goals, but he seems to be wanting validation from me. Honestly, I feel like an ugly duckling around him so at this point, expressing attraction feels like begging and desperation. Him not having any lust for me for months is turning me off now - that’s a funny turn of events. And it happens right around the time he’s expecting me to lust over him because he has more muscles/less fat? Lmao

We spent the night together yesterday after 3 weeks of not seeing each other. He has started a new diet and has lost even more, I wrapped my arms around him and he felt so small. For the first time, I felt a little weirded out by it. What if him actually losing the weight ends up turning me off too ? Ohhh that would be funny. 

We still care a lot for each other and we have a very strong bond, similar values and views on life. We enjoy each other’s company. But the physical side of things is all ruined right now. Thats causing frustration. It provokes more arguments, everything always comes back to this. It makes things awkward. And this has been going on for 10 months now. 

Anyways, I think we’re leading to an end to this. It feels weird because I think I am preparing myself for it, but at the same time I am avoiding it because I still love him despite everything. This is the first relationship I’ve had where I genuinely believe I fell in love. I dont know if I can deal with that type of pain. 

Not sure how long I can keep dealing with this situation either.",1713187774.0,

I’m not trying to be vein but I am a bubbly and attractive girl, I get a lot of attention but it seems like every younger guy I’m with tries to humble me or make me feel upset about my body when we eventually get intimate. I trim but so many younger men make odd comments about it, I’ve never had this from older men so I’m assuming it’s maybe to do with porn since that’s usually included in what guys my age are drawn to. As well as that they always are odd about my boobs - they usually compliment them first since they are quite nice but then also complain that I don’t have huge massive boobs so I just don’t get what they want really. It’s like every guy I date my age has to have one thing about me physically they have to make a nasty and uncalled comment on. Even if something isn’t what I’m extremely attracted to I won’t comment since it doesn’t really matter, why would I want to make someone feel horrible about their own body for no reason. I feel as if I have to fit into every box at the same time.

Older guys have always complimented me and fully accepted my body which I really do appreciate, but it feels like it’ll be impossible for me to be with someone my own age. I’m a confident girl and I’m happy with myself but being with younger guys makes me begin to wonder if there is something wrong about my body when I know it isn’t true, everyone is attractive in their own way.

Icy-Transportation26,I want to stop eyeing up female bodies. ,2,1c4hopg,7,"I've quit porn and I'm on nofap because I realize how much lust rules my life. But for the life of me, if there's breast bouncing in a shirt, I'll crash my car to get a peep. If there's a booty wagging in yoga pants, I'll break my neck to enjoy the art. I'm hoping the longer I go without porn, that it'll become easier to stop doing this.

I've found changing my mindset helps. I've developed the framework that women didn't give me consent to use their body for gratification, and that they literally can't control that they have a body, but with tiktok, my friends, Hollywood, and mainstream music all bombarding me with sexualizing women, I wonder if I can control these urges without quitting all of these sources of entertainment that everyone else enjoys.

I will just have to really force my willpower to control myself, like spraying a dog with water. I will not look at that booty, I will not look at those jugs. 

I don't want to have to get a girlfriend to fix this problem, though. I am aromantic by choice because I want to develop myself before I get in a relationship, or these same problems will start to negatively affect my partner. I want to seriously kill this bad habit. 

Of course I'm not a creep. I think most men are like this. I utilize some finesse and make sure it's only a quick glance. But I want to quit altogether. I don't have any sexual thoughts when I'm not in public, and I don't really enjoy sexual jokes too much (I'll laugh when they're made but I find them too crude to make myself, usually). I'm no prude, I've enjoyed a healthy sex life but I think there's more to life than just settling down with a partner and running the rat race.

MasterJDla,"I really need some help, am I losing control of my life?",2,1c4hoos,0,"This is a long post but I really want to get an outside opinion on what to do. I've been dealing with this for the past few months but this last month really took the cake. I been feeling overwhelmed at trying to do anything to improve my life but I feel so stuck and can't focus on anything.  


I'm stuck at a job of 9 months, that I have to wake up at 5:30 every morning and make 40 minute drives to, not to mention the Job basically demoted me to the status of a Janitor and are now telling me if I mess up one more time I'm fired. I've been trying to find a new job for 6 months now and nothing has come back to me.   


I received my Bachelors Degree in Media Arts and Animation in 2022, but no Job I apply for has accepted my applications. One of my major outlets, making Cartoons and animations, used to be what I would sink 100% of my effort into, has fell off by the wayside. The only time I ever really draw or animate is when I'm in my Car just arriving at work or on my Lunch Break, and even when I get home at 5pm, I usually hop right in bed, thinking I can start drawing and animating, but I usually end up falling asleep thinking it won't be so bad but I'm stressed I'm wasting my time.   


Even on the weekends, I want to just sit down and make my Cartoons, but I get easily distracted with wanting to play Video Games. I feel like I'm using the games as an easy Dopamine fix, to get that short boost of success but I can never seem to break away from it. I have a lot of projects I want to work on and complete, but with all the stress and work I have to deal with, I just don't find that energy i once had to get me going

&#x200B;

It's currently 4am as I'm writing this and I have to go to work in an Hour and a half. I just really want to know what should i do. I want to go back to having that creative drive and take better care of myself, but with all this stuff about working at a dead end Job, looking for another Job, trying to work on my Cartoons for my portfolio and put on the internet, I just feel lost on what to do.",1713172249.0,

now that they mention it, i do feel lonely.

Buncho_grapes,My mum is forcing me to look after our demon dog for 6 weeks while she goes to Australia ,0,1c4ldlx,7,"Okay a bit of context. We got a dog a couple of years ago. The dog never liked me and barks 90% of the time. Nothing I do to try to help the dog helps, and it drives me insane. He has severe separation anxiety from my mum, and is never settled unless he is with her.

I moved out my family home last year for a number of reasons, and have built a life around me that I am content with, for the first time in my life. 

Now that my mum is going on holiday to Australia for 6 weeks, she wants me to home to look after the dog while she is away. 

I know that if I go home for 6 weeks and have to look after the dog, it will be detrimental to my mental health and I will feel trapped. To make matters worse, I would be staying with my brother too, with whom I have never gotten along with. He shouts at me, plays loud shooting games in his room late into the night and leaves trash all over the house that I need to clean up. 

I just know that I would be miserable if agree to do this, but I would feel so guilty saying no, because I love her and want her to be able to travel. I feel stuck and have no idea what to do. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance x",1713185344.0,
,"Dude, I just want to work and then go home. Leave me alone. I do not want to engage in small talk.",6,1c4akfs,8,"It feels like you're obligated to comment on everything I do and watch my every move. If I didn't know you were a straight man with a wife and a kid, I'd think you're hitting on me. **Not that there's anything wrong with that**, **but it'd at least explain why you're seemingly fixated on me.**  
  
When I've just arrived and I see you, you don't need to ask ""oh, you just arrived or you've been here much earlier?"" I do not need to explain that to you nor does it make for an interesting conversation. 

If I adjust my seat, stretch a bit, or generally just move around -- I see you in my peripheral vision turning and staring at me. Stop that shit. 

Quit staring at my computer screen as well. Quit asking me all sorts of questions on what the fuck I'm doing at the moment and why I'm doing it -- these do not concern your job whatsoever.  
  
If I get up to pee, take my break, lunch, or just chill outside because I'm done with my work and just waiting further instructions, then quit fucking asking me where I was and what I did. I do not need to explain anything to you and you don't need to fucking know these. 

If I verbally rant to myself because someone or something at work pissed me off, **READ THE FUCKING ROOM!** Shut the fuck up and stop with the remarks and comments -- I do not need your fucking input nor your support, I need you to shut the fuck up and ignore me. I'm already doing my best to whisper to myself so as not to arouse your fucking attention.  
  
Nothing that comes out your fucking mouth makes for anything close to an interesting conversation. You're like a fucking NPC. Just shut the fuck up, dude. I can't believe I have to ask IT to transfer my workstation somewhere away from you because you're so fucking annoying.  
  
And the annoying thing about it is although you are annoying as fuck, I understand you're a polite person just that you are nosey and obnoxious as hell. I bet if I snapped at you, you'd find a way to make me look like the bad guy. I don't want none of that office drama so I'll just fuck off and hopefully leave me alone?

brighthorse319,People who post group pics on dating profiles,1,1c4knd2,0,"Whenever I'm [20M] scrolling through dating apps, it really bugs me when girls post a group picture with their friends in their profile. It's even more annoying when it's the first picture you see because how are u meant to know which one is the girl??

It's funny when one of their friends they've taken a picture with is more your type/is better looking and that's why I'd never use a group picture (unless I actually look really good in it, in which case I'd crop myself out so u don't see anyone else)",1713183132.0,
ThatAttention9624,I can’t tell if I’m overthinking or walking with my eyes closed.,1,1c4kh2p,0,"My friend and I are interested in each other. (I don’t want to give too many details like age because she uses Reddit frequently) I told my friend I had a crush on her and she informed me she’s had a crush on me for a long time. At first she showed interest but has said she doesn’t want to date because she knows she couldn’t last long in a relationship. But now she shows no interest. But I also have no clue what’s going on in her head. 
Anyway, I used to talk about my coworkers ( guys around my age or old ladies) and the funny stuff that would happen or was said. It was usually the guys cuz the old ladies don’t have to same humor as me. Well she would kinda just brush it off or act like she didn’t really hear me, sometimes acknowledges but changes the subject right after. I don’t understand why she doesn’t like me talking about them. If it’s jealousy, I’ve made it very clear I have no interest in them. I eventually just stopped bringing anything to do with them up. 
Well now she talks about her male coworkers constantly. This one specific guy she brings up always puts me in a bad mood. She can’t stand him but always brings up how he may like her. She says she’s not interested but likes to bring up how he acts around her and the little comments he makes. 

Long story short I can’t tell if my friend was jealous and is now trying (and is) making me jealous. Or if I’m making something out of nothing. I feel bad if I hurt her and made her feel insecure, I want to bring it up but 100% know she’d say I’m overthinking, if it’s not obvious, I do that often. ",1713182607.0,
Januaryaemb,I’m divorcing my husband because of his kids ,2657,1bxf3g6,382,"I (34/f) am leaving my husband (37/m) of 10 years tomorrow. 

We grew up in a small town where everyone knew everyone and every kid went to the same school - so I knew him even before I *knew* him lol. 

My husband fell in love with his late wife in fifth grade and they started dating towards the end of 8th - again, I knew both of them at the time but didn’t actually get to know him until I was 21. Things happened and they ended up getting pregnant in high school and having their daughter at 15 and son at 17 and then got married at 19. 

She passed away from breast cancer when she was 22.

I (officially) met him two years later through a mutual friend. 

I fell INSTANTLY - like heart eyes and everything. However, it was pretty clear that he was no where near ready to be with someone else or even just casually date. I didn’t shoot my shot until half a year later and even then, he said yes but also admitted that he was still really scarred by her passing and didn’t want to promise me anything.

We dated casually for a few months and he introduced me to his kids after a year (I was Miss “My Name.”) 

His kids were shy around me but nothing adnormal. We had a fairly healthy “this is Daddy’s gf” relationship up until we got married almost 2 years later. 

The day I came home as step-mom rather than just the gf - the kids made it very clear that I would never be apart of their family. They continued to keep things respectful but insisted on emotional distance in any way they could. 

No, I could not join them in family holiday traditions. 

No, I couldn’t try to introduce any of my own.

No, their Dad was not allowed to tell me anything about any issues they were going through. 

I very much got the “family that we see twice a year” treatment. 

We did therapy, we had open-talks where they could tell me anything without fear of backlash, I’ve had talks with my husband on what he thinks I should do. Things would get better (I genuinely have some great memories with them) before going back to the same old distantly fond of but still not my family behavior. 

His daughter is currently pregnant with her first child. We’ve really spent a lot of time together planning her shower and just being excited about her baby. Everything was going great until the day of her actual shower (a month ago.) She had already taken a picture with my husband but had wanted to get one with me in it too. I’m standing on one side of her with my husband on the other when she says, with a big grin, “first picture w/Grandpa and Ms. “My Name.”  

Instantly made me tear up. 

I’m always going to just be “Dad’s wife.” She genuinely has no intention of allowing me to be anything close to a grandmother to her baby. 

I’ve thought this over ever since but I want to have a family while I still can. Tomorrow morning - I’m telling my husband that I want a divorce.

Trigger warning
.
.
My ex beat me to death last year. My heart stopped, I had an NDE but somehow I got going again. It was a 12 hour ordeal that landed us on the news. I feel like I can’t escape it because of the never ending court dates, media, people asking me about it. My identity is him. He’s representing himself so I’ll have to be cross examined at trial. By him. I feel like I can’t breathe most of the time. I wish I didn’t survive it. My job fired me for not recovering fast enough. I had over 10 broken, staples in my head, my right eye stitched back together. 11 broken ribs, shattered hands & wrists that had to be rebuilt with titanium. There was an SA that turned a white queen mattress completely red. I can’t escape it and it shattered my life & who I was. 

Edit to add - please don’t try to go IRL and send me articles of various domestics asking if it’s the right one. Please. I just need support without looking at it along with other peoples news articles that aren’t mine. ",1712010703.0,
