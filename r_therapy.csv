agoraphobicbee,got rejected by the social anxiety support group. what do i even do now?????,6,1c6ctfn,2,"first-time poster in this sub, never lurked here or anything. but it‚Äôs basically just like the title says‚Äîmy therapy place has recently started a social anxiety support group, and i was really really excited when i found out about it because i‚Äôve been struggling with it for years and it‚Äôs gotten worse lately as i‚Äôve been a lot lonelier but i‚Äôve struggled to talk to or connect with people. in fact, my therapist (not the one in charge of the social anxiety group) even said during one session that she wishes she could get a lot of us socially anxious folks together in one room so we could know we‚Äôre not alone.

i just checked my email, and‚Ä¶the guy running the social anxiety group said it ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be a good fit for me‚Äù, based on how i answered the screening questions. which leaves me feeling confused and hurt, honestly. my answers were pretty similar to the things i said in the first paragraph of this post. are social anxiety support groups not meant for‚Ä¶socially anxious people who want to develop better skills and interact with others? how do they not realize that this is just going to make me feel worse about trying to reach out?

mojorojod,My wife cheated on me with her best friend ,5,1c6ay1l,3,"I married last year in July. Everything was perfect. We were from two different countries and met through mutual family friends. For the initial 6 months, we lived away from each other while my immigration papers were getting sorted. We talked every night. After some time talking to me on the phone, she would say good night and tell me she‚Äôs off to sleep. However, I started noticing that she would stay online on WhatsApp for hours after that. I asked her a few times, but she never gave a straight answer, which made me doubt everything. Anyway, I moved to her country eventually and started living together. She would go off to work early in the day and come back in the evening. 

I kept thinking about what if she‚Äôs having an affair? I couldn‚Äôt stop those thoughts coming to my mind. I was going mad and could think about nothing else. One day, I decided to go through her laptop and found a letter from her best friend (a female). Just out of curiosity I started to read it. That letter brought my whole world crashing down. They were having a relationship. It detailed everything. The ‚Äúmemories‚Äù they made. The moment they started their relationship. The way they just can‚Äôt keep their hands off each other. How my wife slept with her even on the night before our wedding. And a lot of more details. 

I was shattered but did not say anything to my wife. I assumed that all these things would have happened before we got married, even though I was engaged to her. But still I kept all of that to myself. But then I went through their messages to confirm whether everything is over or not, but to my shock they were still on it. A full on proper romantic relationship - not just physical but emotional as well. I still remained silent. 

One day my wife took a pregnancy test and it came positive. We are becoming parents. I was super happy. However, I thought it is time to confront her and ask her to end everything. She outright refused everything at first but when I shared the specifics, she admitted it and said she has ended everything and I will have to trust her. I agreed. I even agreed to her continuing her friendship with that friend assuming that she will come to her senses. However, I checked her messages again and she was apologising to her for getting pregnant, saying sorry to her for breaking her trust. I couldn‚Äôt hold it any more and went batshit crazy and angry and said awful things to my wife and asked her to choose between her and me. She said she chooses me.

But then my wife said that she‚Äôs hurt by my words and anger and feels scared to live with me and is scared for her safety and the safety of the baby. She turned everything into my fault. She complained about how I violated her privacy by going through the messages, she said that she is an independent woman and I can‚Äôt ask her who she can be friends with. It‚Äôs her choice and I will have to trust her. One burst of anger made me the wrong person. I feel horrible and am not happy at all. I still apologised to her for the anger and said I am ok with whatever she wants to do. 

Since then, she doesn‚Äôt let me touch her, saying that she doesn‚Äôt feel like doing anything because of pregnancy and I need to give her time to get over what ‚ÄúI‚Äù have done. I want this marriage to continue because of our baby if not for love. I do love her. But I am not getting any love back. It gets suffocating at times. ",1713363198.0,

Empty-Brief-4545,Changing therapists due to them being  too ‚Äúwoke‚Äù/political.,2,1c6dssa,4,"Hey guys!

I‚Äôve been going to my current therapist for almost a year now. She has taught me to view things from a different perspective and learn that I wasn‚Äôt the real reason for the breakup of my boyfriend of two years.

She‚Äôs great, but there‚Äôs some things that I‚Äôm not sure if I should bring to her attention, or just find a new therapist.

___

For example; we will greet each other and she will ask what I had for lunch and I‚Äôd say Chick-fil-A. She will then go off on how she would never support such a homophobic company. I‚Äôm a gay 28 year old, but I‚Äôm also not political at all. I find faults on both sides. So I just stay out of it. 

Then somehow our conversation got to cars one session and she found out I drive a Tesla and she was shocked and said ‚Äúthat owner of the company is a an awful antisemitic, fascist man. I would NEVER step inside a Tesla. I know they‚Äôre popular as Ubers and I would request another ride if I see mine is one‚Äù.  

I don‚Äôt know if she realizes when she says these things it makes me kind of feel ‚Äúattacked‚Äù and makes the whole encounter super awkward. She always needs to put her political beliefs in. 

She then asked if I know any accountants because she went to her CPA to do her taxes and she had to walk out because she saw a Ron Disantis book in his office. Then she goes off about that. 

I‚Äôm not sure how to bring it up to her that politics makes me feel uncomfortable - especially if it‚Äôs pointing out my ‚Äúactions‚Äù in life and how I‚Äôm supporting the wrong companies/people. 


Should I bring it up to her? Or just switch therapists? ",1713370149.0,
tireturner360,Need help opening up,1,1c6h3pu,0,"Hello everyone, I need advice on how to open up to other people and interact and make friends/good relations with people. My therapist has told me that I should maintain my existing relations (college people who helped me out through my tough times) and I should now take steps to make such relations with other people. I want to meet new people and talk more, but I fail to do so because of trust issues, abandonment issues, low self esteem, bad body image. I've had problems getting along with people ever since I started acknowledging my own feelings and putting my well being on top. However I haven't really found anyone who seems to connect with me completely and i understand that there are adjustments to be made in any connection. I wonder if I'm defective when I feel like no one actually likes me. I used to focus alot on my grades and extra curricular activities before, thinking that being good at everything will make everyone like me. Learning how to do things taught me alot but also conditioned me that I'll always be worth only when I'm useful. Although I can't keep on impressing everyone anymore and I want to live my life the way I Want it and most importantly I WANT TO SHARE IT WITH SOMEONE. Im about to graduate in a few weeks and I have no one significant who will really care about it (except  my therapist) I go to sleep at night hoping that maybe one day someone will meet me like in animes and we'll be BFFs, but that's just me being delusional and hoping for a better future.

Formal_Engineer_2075,"my sexual behavior is causing me distress, does anyone have an idea of what's going on? ",2,1c6amxz,2,"I have cycles of intense episodes of online sex then withdrawing for days or months, but within the episode I'm in a bubble for 6-20 hours - I don't perceive body signals anymore and when I gotten off I might feel physically very exhausted, almost kind of numb. I'm also doing things in this bubble that later make me feel repulsed, guilty and that are against my values. But when I'm in the bubble I get absorbed completely, not only physically but also mentally, e. g. I think of making different future choices and leaving the life I knew behind for the sex world, those moments (and sometimes after). I want to sexually act out in ways that are dangerous for me and would cause me to feel even worse about myself than after the online thing.

So it feels like there's a big inconsistency between my sexual self and personality. Its hard for me to distinguish between kink and reality, sometimes the line gets blurry for me. Maybe I would feel different about all of this if I was sexual with a safe trusted partner. But when online I'm all over the place and I NEVER stick to one chat to have a proper 1-1 conversation and share intimacy with one person. It's very impersonal, restless, black and white. Also, without going into details, I was wondering if it can ever be developmentally healthy to overly sexualize and objectify oneself, even if it's your  ""kink"".I think that underneath I do it for validation but again its not enough to receive it from one person. And I suspect that I'm evading actual vulnerability by never focusing on one person. I tried to explore my sexuality irl but always felt uncomfortable in some way and backed off. With regular dates I feel comfortable but never satisfied.

Ike_234,Why do my problems sound so childish to me?,1,1c6g1q1,1,"I get really embarrassed about talking to people about my past and why I am the way I am. Like today I was talking to my therapist and we brought up some things I can remember from when I was a child. Before I was 5, I remember my parents would fight and one particular night I just wanted them to stop so I put soap in my eyes to get them to stop and pay attention to me. My therapist and I realized that was my first ever time doing self harm. I struggled with self harm even a few months ago where I would scratch my leg until I saw blood. And then after my mom and dad got divorced, I moved in with my grandparents. I looked up to my grandaddy and I was wanted his acceptance. It would crush me when I knew I disappointed him. When I was in the 2nd grade I struggled with math. He would sit me down in the kitchen and get mad at me if couldn‚Äôt figure out the answer. The absolute worst part was he would give up and just tell me the answer. I‚Äôve struggled with feeling like a failure ever since. Can anyone relate?

fm_artz,I'm the only one that feels the world ended since 2020?,23,1c5w4zy,5,"I dont know if I'm the only one but, since covid I feel like all these 4 years passes like days and I feel stuck in time since then and I just seeing decadence and darkness in every aspect of life.

&#x200B;

This is my situation: I'm from Venezuela (A cursed country if you ask me) where getting a job is just an equal of being a slave for worthless coins. 

I'm on the final phase of a graphic design career (thesis) but I have like 6 months paralyzed since my actual work doesn't give me enough income to fund that last ladder (I fear that I'll get it lost eventually) and we're bankrupt in every side, I don't have anyone to ask or seek for help, I live with my parents (Wich makes me feel like shxt since I'm 24) and all my family members are on a similar situation (everyone is depressed and doesn't know what to do either, so I feel that I cannot get nothing from them) a 40% of my job is trying to revive an entrepreneurship that went bankrupt (a paralyzed family business), my job situation is shxt because I have to do ""Internships"" that are required on my college but, I have like 1 year looking and applying and, nothing, while I see everyone haves it more easy. 

I try to do freelance but I cannot get serious or stable works because this piece of shxt college requirement haves me seriously limited and ofc, I want to get that done in order to graduate faster when I get back. We had 6 months of pure medical issues from my father, that made us bankrupt and we're still on it, getting a lot of debts, my mother haves a lot of medical issues too and is enduring all of this, while doesn't know what to do to cope with the situation that brings us, I'm doing all the possible to provide, but everytime I try, I fail, I just get nothing while I'm working day to night (even 3 days with no sleep) and nothing, just more problems everytime, I feel everyday that I'm a charge for my family, a piece of shxt, I wan't to leave, but I don't have a stable income and I'll feel bad leaving them in such a situation. I feel like I'm invisible to anyone outside, I feel like everyone hates me, I cannot get outside because I don't have any money to get outside, I'm cursed definitely.

Having a phone doesn't help me either, Everyday I just open any social media and I see anything progressing or anything related to my country's situation (politics or any news), I feel depressed and sick of everything, everything around me starts to looks hateful, I even feel the urge to stop living and thinking about ways of leaving the world (No, I'm not cancelled or anything, this feeling is just by getting the phone). I even feel that AI on creative industry insn't that troublesome for me, but it just adds more to this ""marketing"" fever sickness I'm seeing lately.  


And this is just the last 6 months. I was feeling a decadence on my life since 2020/2021, although I got more individual works since then, college stress didn't help, family business started to die since 2022 and I still working hard to ""Revive it"" with every stretegy but it doesn't work, my personal projects are paralyzed since 2022, I feel hopeless at this moment, while everything is just going on and, as the tittle says, I feel stuck in time, What advice you would give me in this situation?

That was until this past year or so, when I really started working through my trauma.

Now it's a daily battle to get anything done. I wake up on the verge of a panic attack, and the only sort of relief I get is when I've worn myself out enough to be too tired to feel anything at all. I can't bring myself to talk to my partner about it, and I'm entirely unable to bring up issues in our relationship like I could before either, so our communication is at risk of breaking down.

I tried out therapy and the first visit just didn‚Äôt go as expected. I don‚Äôt want to discredit her professionalism with my experience but it just seemed like she was uninterested the whole time. She was messing with her nails and when I was being vulnerable she was just typing away on her computer, it just makes me not want to be vulnerable ever again?

I understand that she might‚Äôve had a long day and it was already 5 PM but it just wasn‚Äôt what I expected, I thought she would be more receptive and interested in getting to know me.

I spent a lot of time researching therapists and chose her cause of her background. I‚Äôve had a bad experience with another therapist so I really don‚Äôt want to make myself go to therapy when I don‚Äôt feel like I want to.

I'm a 25 year old guy going to be turning 26 soon and my birthday has been giving me so much anxiety because I can't help but think what a failure as a human I've been during these 26 years. What I'm most anxious about is the fact that I've never been in a relationship. I have so many friends that are in relationships, have hooked up, been married, the lot and I've experienced none of it. It's gotten so bad that I can't even watch tv shows that have good happy relationships or s\*x scenes in them because I'll just get so depressed, as stupid as that sounds.

I've tried putting myself out there before and it hasn't led to much. I've tried using bumble and while I've gotten a few matches, they never messaged me which makes me feel even worse.

I guess the point of this post is that I just need support. I just feel that I've wasted prime years as it relates to relationships and that I'll never have one.

Mayhem_san,I'm my own worst critic- and I feel like it's killing me mentally.,1,1c6dpdp,1,"So allow me to give a bit of context:  
  
I've struggled with giving myself credit‚Äîa lot. This case was no exception. I was on a call with two friends, one of them's working up into the TV writing industry. My other friend, alongside me, is working up into filmmaking, and we were drafting a movie in the early stages together. TV writer friend was throwing out a lot of tips based on where the two of us were and what needed to happen.  
Now, up until this point, the advice she gave REALLY was good: Loglines, pitching based on summaries to an executive, knowing where to go in terms of connections, how to make your characters resonate with the audience, and a bunch of other stuff.  
I got off the call, ruminated over it, and my brain somehow concluded ""Okay, yeah, you know how you thought you were a good screenwriter? That's not true anymore. Never was, apparently, because how the fuck did you miss all of what she came up with until now? You've been in this whole thing for a full YEAR by now, didn't even once think about actually developing your stories.""  
  
Called my dad, and in 12 minutes, my side of things went from ""find me screenwriting workshops"" (because one of the points my TV writer friend gave was that workshops get you notoriety for developing your craft) to ""I don't know if it's worth it in the end"" and me going on about not actually making an effort because my work ethic isn't there anymore (from long stage severe academic burnout)  
  
I was pretty damn nice grades-wise in High school, great GPA, kept on top of assignments, and always pushed myself, but now- I'm my own worst critic, and I can't actually self-assure or be proud of myself. Because of that, my self-image has taken a huge nosedive in the past year or so.

Fast forward to now, she refuses to have anything to do with me unless he kicks her out of the house and she needs somewhere to stay. They are always getting into these huge fights and she refuses to move in with me and switch schools. She is failing out of highschool.

Since I never had anyone to open up to nor the feeling of safety from an adult, I now feel very sad about the fact that I won‚Äôt have my therapist beside me anymore. It feels like I‚Äôm being abandoned (again).

It‚Äôs funny in a way because my therapist probably just think of me as any other patient/client that will be forgotten once a new patient takes the spot.

Like, allowing me to vent my frustrations, finding out why certain things affects me and if I'm justified in feeling the way I do, then telling me what I need to change about how I handle things.

Feisty-Maximum5687,Should I leave my therapist?,1,1c669nz,6,"23F here. I've been going to therapy for the last 3 months. Initially, a few things about the therapist did make me feel a bit doubtful. She used to respond to stuff with ""Let me tell you something"" and then go on to give her advice. It felt like a bit of an ego trip on her part. I continued with sessions anyway.   
In the last few sessions, I have started feeling like she doesn't make an effort to understand me at all. I have been going through a phase where I feel hopeless and have a hard time getting myself to do even simple things. In every session she seems to get frustrated with me and tells me things like ""I can't do anything if you don't put in the work"" and ""Nobody else is going to come and do the work for you"". Finally I snapped and asked her when she got a sign from me that I expected others to come and save me. In that session she softened up a bit and actually tried to be empathetic.   


In one session, I was telling her about how my older brother used to behave very creepily towards me when I was a child and would tell me disturbing details about his sex life. It was understood from the background I gave her that he was very aggressive towards me and I didn't have any support from my parents. Despite this, she immediately responded with, ""why didn't you stop him then?"". I don't get if this was a genuine question she had, but it felt a bit like I was getting blamed for the situation.  


In the last session, when I tried telling her about my childhood trauma and some of the stuff my parents had said to me when I was a child, she responded with ""What do you expect me to do? Do you want me to sympathise with you?"". It feels like she has some ego issues and thinks I'm inventing my problems for her. That statement genuinely made me doubt myself though. I had a difficult childhood, with my mom having severe anxiety issues and my dad being extremely controlling and treating my mom, brother and me badly. Still, is it time to just move on? Am I wrong for wanting to talk about the things which happened?  


I want to hear other's opinions on this. Should I leave therapy with her? I've left my previous two therapists because they used to say stuff which made me feel worse. I was hoping that this time I would have a better experience but that doesn't seem to be happening :(",1713349210.0,
BjornReborn,Is suddenly getting triggered at small things a part of the healing process? ,3,1c5zzrm,1,"
I‚Äôve been in therapy for 1.5yr. Switched between four therapists until I found the right one. 

As I‚Äôm processing my grief, I am noticing I‚Äôm getting triggered by actions my significant other does unintentionally and I‚Äôm wondering if this is normal or an underlying thing I don‚Äôt know how to have revealed. 

For instance

1. I got triggered when I perceived I was being interrupted more suddenly. Then I did self reflection and realized for some reason I was doing the interrupting more lately which is out of character for me. I have started to take trazodone so I am generally feeling on ‚Äòedge‚Äô or a need to compete yet I‚Äôm not anxious anymore.

2. Pills. My partner took a diuretic that I thought was Xanax over the weekend at like 12pm in the middle of the day immediately preceding an emotionally deep conversation that was vulnerable. My family used to pull this shit with pills and drinking and it would make me feel like I wasn‚Äôt enough to share my emotions. That I am emotional labor for them. I was able to recognize I was triggered and I grounded myself through it. And I talked to my partner about it. I asked them first what they took and they showed me so that I didn‚Äôt approach the situation with wrong assumptions. 

3. Depression. Partner has recently become depressed due to life circumstances and feeling trapped in their career. I recognized I got triggered AGAIN because in the past, when I was very young and much more naive (I am naive)‚Ä¶ depression was used as a manipulative tactic to keep me around. I know my partner would never do this. 

All these things though are causing my partner to feel on edge that they now just trigger me by being when it‚Äôs not the case. I know *they* do not trigger me. 

But I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm suddenly being triggered by these things one after another and if it‚Äôs a good thing (a sign I‚Äôm healing my grief?) or if it‚Äôs a bad thing‚Ä¶

sirhc9114,Using sex to mask emotional abuse,2,1c61sxg,4,"My ex and I started dating in college for about a year and she ended up cheating on me with her ex boyfriend before me. We broke up but remained in contact at times. Would be on and off. Would hook up from time to time. This opened a door to us discussing other past hook ups she has had and found that we liked talking about that. 

After about 2.5 years we got back together and continued our relationship not without a lot of hurdles. Getting back into it I told myself I had to accept that she may cheat on me again but had to try and trust her if it was going to work out. We ended up dating for another 4 years but not without issues. She would end up communicating with her ex and at first of course would tell me about it and it was innocent to start. After 3 years we moved in together and during that time found they weren‚Äôt as innocent. I told her I wasn‚Äôt ok with her talking to him and wasn‚Äôt comfortable. I felt like I always wanted to be empathetic and understanding of why she felt the need to talk to him but looking back I realized I wasn‚Äôt putting myself first in these situations.

During year 4 she was struggling mentally with a new career etc and found they were sexting and trading nudes and of course was mad but tried to be understanding again. She ended up asking me to be allowed to hook up with him which of course I said no to. But I honestly didn‚Äôt know how to react to that so we ended up role playing it. I clearly tried to just turn it into something sexual because I was basically in shock and with our history of talking about things like that as well as talking about finding someone for a 3some it‚Äôs just how I responded. 

We ended up breaking up and I am now 1 year post break up and she was with her ex who she cheated on me with and asked to fuck while together and they have now been together a year. She got together with him immediately after we broke up. I still get so turned on by her. I have trouble seeing myself being sexual with someone else. I‚Äôm clearly not over her but also worried that this will affect me for years to come. I have such low sex drive towards anybody else but her but when I think about her I instantly get into it. 

I am so aware this was an extremely unhealthy and abusive relationship where my boundaries weren‚Äôt respected at all. Part of me wishes I could have been that guy that just says fuck off but I always felt like I needed to be understanding because I felt responsible for her mental health and didn‚Äôt want her to struggle more. 

I know I‚Äôm not completely innocent in this and didn‚Äôt act in the healthiest ways which just lead to more trauma. I am looking into therapy and know it will help. I‚Äôm just anxious as I‚Äôm fearful that I won‚Äôt ever be able to get over this or stop feeling this way. That I won‚Äôt be able to have a healthy normal relationship. I‚Äôm hoping that all I need is more time and I‚Äôll see that but hard to keep that mindset. Definitely starting to not feel good about myself because of it all.

Alex_is146,Looking for Advice / Outside Opinion (Long post sorry),1,1c63w42,0,"Hi. Thought I'd just share a little bit about myself. This is gonna be kind of long so I apologize and also preemptively thank anyone who reads this lol. I'm 21M and I've recently been thinking a lot more about my life at the start of this year. I've only just gotten my first job in January and when I realized how... simple it was to do I felt stupid for waiting so long to get one. I graduated high school during the pandemic and I think ever since my life has just gone downhill. I lost a scholarship at my uni for flunking a semester (realized CS was *not* it) and it really just angered me more than anything. I was having a hard time that semester cause I had taken all my classes online when they definitely should've been taken in person, and I had a really shitty sleep schedule. I'd spend most of my time coping with video games, social media, and porn. 

&#x200B;

On top of this, I stopped being friends with one of my closest friends ever. She had broken up with her boyfriend (who I was friends with and am still on good terms with today) and didn't feel the need to consult me before telling me she wanted to break up with him. She'd also started hanging out with this really strange girl several years older than us who was just a bad drinking influence & had that whole ""men are garbage / you should drop him"" mentality. I just didn't like her vibe. Me and the ex-boyfriend had talked a lot because when they broke up he reached out to me telling me how sad he felt and how he didn't understand where the breakup was coming from. I was mostly disappointed in the fact that as one of her closest friends she wouldn't confide with me about that, and she would choose to tell me days later after she had broken up with the guy. She'd probably say to this day that I took her boyfriend's side but it doesn't seem like she cared for me to be *on* her side. It really sucks because she was a really good friend and I feel like if things hadnt ended with him like they did, her and I would still be really good friends. I've had like 3 restless nights in the past 2 years where I stay up drafting a freaking message to send her but I just fall asleep and the next day I think about how much of an idiot I am for even thinking about her anymore. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, it was her and my best *best* friend who I'm still friends with today. She's pretty much my only friend. I've known her for about 10 years now and she's my rock. It was them two and I that would hang out together and talk and play video games, but we've definitely got different lives now. My best friend who I still talk to today is really busy with her schoolwork cause she's pre-med and I feel like what I've done in college in comparison is nothing. I've recently started thinking about going pre-med as well (or pre-PA) but I feel too old already to head down that path. I know it sounds ridiculous but I feel if you aren't exiting the womb with med or law school in your sights then you're already late. 

&#x200B;

I've also generally really suffered with my sleep schedule. I just can't find the means to get up from bed sometimes. I've had many days where I just have nothing to do, and, I know some people would probably kill for a day off but I just don't know what to do by myself. I've been trying to get into an exercise routine but I can't figure out how to get started. My sleep and eating habits aren't aligned well enough for me to actually exercise productively. 

Generally speaking, I'm a pretty optimistic guy. I try not to let things get me down and I always try to solve my problems rationally. I find myself always giving help or advice to others but I think I need help for myself. I'm considering getting therapy. I just need to talk with someone so they can help me sort through my thoughts. If anyone would like to share a similar story or some advice for my situation, please do so.

MonaxikoLoukaniko,Is this how it's supposed to be like?,5,1c5rzaq,4,"Hi there! I somewhat recently decided (+ forced by some circumstances) to seek help for some issues I've been having for the past few years, so I started therapy sessions with a psychiatrist. First session, I tell him about myself and a bit of my issues and we book the next one.

Every session after that starts by him asking me about what has happened since our previous session. So I tell him about stuff related to my issues that has happened since then (not a lot, my daily life's been very uneventful lately) and how they've caused me anxiety or distress. He'll usually ask a couple follow up questions that I'll answer and then it's silence for a couple minutes. 

He'll then break the silence with another question, either related or not ( e.g. would X situation cause you anxiety, what do you feel when you do Y, do you usually do Z, etc.), which I'll answer, then silence again. Repeat a few times for the remainder of the session. At the end, he might offer me some usually obvious advice on something coming up that I told him about during the session and then we part ways.

It's been about a dozen sessions so far and I don't really understand it. I don't really get how it's supposed to be helping. Am I supposed to be doing something with the silence? Am I supposed to be doing something differently in general?

Do you think this will lead anywhere eventually? It's his job so I'm trying to trust the process, but I'm worried. I know I should probably ask him, but I'm scared that it will come off like I'm challenging him and might devolve into an argument or sth.

ive been by his side since i was 11 n i would do most mundane things for him like make his bed, make him dinner and tea and putting shows on for him. and my dad is very picky he only likes one specific genre n hes watched every single show/movie thats tagged with that genre. yet he still gets mad when i cant find shows for him to watch like what do u expect me to do? go film one??? and every single day i have to go to him n read a list of shows that hes watched to see if he wants to rewatch them.

ive tried to make him watch different genres but he gets mad n throws the phone like a toddler.

he always calls for me and i always go to him but the times that i cant he drags my name into the mud as if ive chopped off his leg or something. for example if i go out to the cinema n get dinner n im not home by 8pm he gets so mad that the neighbors can hear him yelling yet he encourages my step sisters to go out n have fun. why am i not allowed to have a life outside of taking care of him??? not to mention, im a senior so i have a lot of work to do and its so much and every time i tell him i have to study he throws a fit n says that im a shit daughter n that ive never been there for him.

the biggest problem is that i have a step sister a year younger than me n my dad adores her even though shes always lazy n always talks back to him n it js hurts cuz why are you treating me like that when i know your capable of love?

i know that he favors my stepmom and her kids over us and i dont care but if you love them so much why dont they take care of you?? im so sick of this.

and today i got a package for some hair products that i desperately need (he doesnt let me go to the store to buy them cuz im only allowed out twice a month) n while i was signing the thing he heard me n my stepmom told him that it was a package.

ive never seen him get this mad. he literally threw the package on the ground and started to step on it n he yelled that if i disobey him again im gonna have the same fate as that package.

hours later, he hugged me?? i feel disgusted like a man ive never met become came up to me n hugged me. i genuinely wish i didnt have a dad.",1713296264.0,

My wife (24F) and I (32M) have been together since 2018. Up until about a year ago our intimate life was phenomenal and I couldn't have been happier. We had done a great deal of work to help her heal the past trauma and we were doing well. My wife 3 years ago decided to pursue justice for the continual SA she faced from the age of 9 until she moved out. Over 100 instances of this happening, or at least once a month average with some dry spells, and some where it was weekly. Always when he got drunk on Wednesday nights. 

Fast forward to last Thursday. He was finally charged and arrested for Continual Sexual Assault of a Minor > 14. Since then, my wife has put an end to our intimacy, for at least 3-6 months. This includes eliminating physical touch and ""acting like roommates"". My primary love language is physical touch, and by a HUGE margin. I NEED physical touch to feel love and she knows this. 

I know this has to do with her adoptive father being arrested, as she's stated she's finally accepting it as a reality, instead of the hellish nightmare she thought it was before. I thought we crossed this bridge a while ago, and I thought she was fine. Turns out it was a mask. 

I'm at a loss cause I love her, but I don't know how I'll cope with the constant pain of rejection and emotional abandonment. Especially since she isn't sure she'll get to a point anywhere close to where she is now? I wish I never pushed her to seek justice, knowing now it would ruin my marriage.

Unlikely-Fox-554,Recently relocated,1,1c5wszk,0,"Last year around Black Friday we lost our 3 bedroom apartment due to inability to cover our cost of living, this tanked our collective credit, then we had successively worse issues with our one and only vehicle after having sold our second, which was essentially a gift from her recently deceased grandmother, to try to save our home in a previous month. 

We now live in a hotel, work at the restaurant in the hotel parking lot, a sister store to my original job. I brought my wife on to the job because her being a stay at home mother was not working out. I have been off and on with the company for 8 years, and have worked almost every position save for gm. I have clearance to do all the things that essentially run the store, and have offered assistance or minor guidance when asked by the current management team as i come from a higher business store. However the new store gm has passed me over and written me off for any next step up. Im slightly jealous that my wife is being given more consideration of a promotion over myself, however i am also proud of her because she deserves it just as much as I do.

In the past I would take a leave of the job occasionally to take an opportunity with a higher title, better pay, and more promise of a better future. Trouble would ensue because it wasnt quite a joint effort and sometimes i wouldn‚Äôt properly communicate my needs.

Lately i feel like my relationship is struggling due to the fustercluck of the situation, the factors and circumstances included. Im consistently reminded in my daily life that we haven‚Äôt been able to move forward in the 6 months since being essentially trapped here. I‚Äôve submitted my taxes and expect a sizeable return, at least enough that could assist with a down payment on a new vehicle lease hopefully. That‚Äôs something that‚Äôs needed first and foremost to be able to get out of our predicament. 

My child asks when we will be able to move out and i try to plan to be in a home on a lease by the end of summer. I am upset with myself and my inability to get ahead. Its been a consistent struggle. She is adjusting better here than i am and i feel alienated in our circumstances due to completely trying to cut out all distractions and focus on a path forward. 

I have applied at many different companies/positions and have interviews on the books but i cant make things work because the cost of living is still too high here to rely on my partner to carry us solo for 2-3 weeks after starting a better job while i wait around on a paycheck, it doesn‚Äôt help that this need also competes with our opposite schedule and if i took a better position she would either be forced into a position to work around my schedule or have to quit and work overnight.

She is still willing to work around our needs and is honestly a wonderful person and truly amazing partner, sometimes we have taken each other for granted in the past, but we still take life in spades and work well together.

Stokegirly,Has a therapist ever used something you‚Äôve mentioned in their own life?,4,1c5lsvb,1,"An interesting one but I brought up my relationship with a younger family member and how I wanted to be their safe person. Other than my parents I didn‚Äôt really have a ‚Äúsafe person‚Äù to go to who I felt wouldn‚Äôt get me into trouble so I found in situations I was uncomfortable in I was stuck. Let‚Äôs face it who as a teen told their parents their every move? I certainly didn‚Äôt ü§£

So when they got old enough to be out with friends and stuff like that I spoke with them telling them how if they ever felt unsafe or uncomfortable with a situation for example their friends trying to pester them into something they didn‚Äôt want to do or they had gotten themselves in danger.. any situation they wanted to get out of but were to scared to call their mum/dad that they could contact me with a password that we decided on and I would get them out of whatever had happened without judgement and as long as they hadn‚Äôt been harmed that we could keep it between us, we would talk about the situation and how it made them feel, how to keep themselves safe etc but they could trust I wouldn‚Äôt lecture them etc. this also went for situations they were to embarrassed to tell their parents about. This meant they didn‚Äôt need to feel like they were being made to do something because I pretend to be the bad guy demanding they get home now üòÇ‚Ä¶ thankfully it only had to be used once and I got some funny looks from my colleagues when I was (pretending) to shout at this family member for being out when they were supposed to be grounded. I got them somewhere safe and we had a chat about what happened over a bowl of ice cream.

Anyway, we touched on it again during my session and she said. ‚ÄúI thought about what you were talking about and I love that idea.‚Äù She went on to tell me she asked them who they felt they could go to if they didn‚Äôt want to call her in similar circumstances to the above ^^

And arranged for them to have a pass phrase with this person so if they ever felt like they needed someone who wasn‚Äôt their mum they had someone to go to who wasn‚Äôt going to judge them.

Strangely enough, I don‚Äôt crave sympathy from my parents. I love them and I know they love me, that‚Äôs it.

But otherwise, around friends and other people that I like, I crave their pity and sympathy. I often fantasise about people worrying about me and being sympathetic to what I‚Äôm going through. In my fantasies, I‚Äôm often crying or going through something deeply painful and my friends pity me and sympathise with me. I feel like being a victim adds to me self-worth, I suppose, I‚Äôm not sure.

The issue is, I don‚Äôt really have any struggles in my life that deserve sympathy and pity. I‚Äôm just your average person, perhaps with a few more mental health struggles that your average person.

When I was 6, my adopted brother took me into his room and told me to take off my underwear and to sit on his face. This followed throughout my whole life of him asking the same thing over and over again, and I've never said a word. 1. He's autistic, and 2. My parents (adoptive) would've never believed me anyway, so l've kept it hidden. I'm now 18, and he hasn't asked in 2 years.

I never did anything he asked, but this still affects me, especially with men.

I've come across a thought process I have developed and I'm not entirely sure if it's alarming to Others¬ÆÔ∏è. The phrase ""I'm not mad, just disappointed"" carries literally no weight for me. No matter who may say it. I seek approval from no one and disappointing people means effing nothing to me. I love, cherish, and deeply care for several people in my life.

NumberOfTheBeast2112,Waking up with bad anxiety for the past week since meeting a new girl whom I really like,1,1c5g4cu,1,"I have struggled with anxiety in the past, but had been doing well in the past few months. I should preface this by saying I ended a 2.5 year relationship back in February. Things had been rocky since the previous November, and I don't regret ending it at all. It gave me huge relief and allowed me to focus on bettering myself. This past week, I met a new girl whom I really like. We have been texting non-stop and have a date planned for when she's done her exams. I get the feeling that she really likes me as well, and texting her has been amazing.  




Here's the problem; ever since I started texting her, I have been waking up with bad anxiety that persists throughout most of the day (usually fades a bit in the evening). It has affected my appetite and my overall happiness. I keep trying to tell myself that this is a positive step in my life, something I am sure I'm excited and happy about, so why is it causing me so much anxiety? It got to a point a few days ago when I saw her text in the morning, I felt like I was going to throw up. I met my ex in a similar fashion (online dating) but didn't feel like this back then even though she was my first partner. I do admittedly feel much more of an instant connection with this new girl than I did with my ex at the time, which is maybe why I'm getting more anxious about it.  




Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to be having to deal with this every day as it is very unpleasant. I have a therapy session booked tomorrow which should hopefully help, and I have been doing my best to meditate or organize my thoughts. My parents have been very supportive, as they also struggle with anxiety but I'm just getting really tired of feeling like this. I told this new girl that I struggle with anxiety sometimes and that I've been experiencing it in the past week (I didn't mention that I think it's because I met her), and she has been very compassionate and supportive about it. I do feel comfortable talking to her about it, but not sure if it would be a good idea to tell her I think my anxiety is caused by my excitement towards getting to know her. I think this could maybe make me feel better, but I don't want to weird her out or anything lol.  




TL:DR I have met a new girl that I really like, but it has been causing me daily anxiety even though it is a positive step in my life. I don't want to have to deal with this anxiety every day and would appreciate any help!",1713274131.0,

BlueCollarPhilosophr,Skeptical about Therapy,3,1c543te,1,"Are there situations where therapy isn't really of much help? What if the reason you feel like crap is because your life IS crap? Can you really talk your way out of acknowledging that reality if you lack the ability to change your actual circumstances?

For example, if you've got not much money, not much potential to make more than immediate survival pay/not much prospect for future success, chronic insecurity that if you miss a beat no one will catch you if you fall because you lack an extended family or friends or any social safety net, no real romantic life and little potential for one, etc. (That last one seems too trivial to include compared to the others.) Some of us are conscientious only because we're constantly living on a knife's edge, waiting for that unexpected emergency to push us to one or the other side of the tightrope where we're living out of a tent waiting to be assaulted since there's little protection from a thin layer of fabric. And for what? What's our reward for surviving another day? To get to do it all over again day after day until we're exhausted to death? We develop addictions to help manage the stress of... being alive, making survival even more difficult since now you have to cope with the negative consequences of the addictions, too. But something's gotta give to take the edge off of being alive, since the edge ain't never going away.

I mean, seriously, if I had the fearlessness (don't worry, I don't), why suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune when there's always the mercy that no one else can take away from you of being able to take arms against a sea of troubles and just end it already? It's kind of a comfort to know that, even if solutions aren't available, ultimate relief always is. If the game is rigged so that you can never win it, you can always opt out of the game itself. Don't like the rules of the game? Refuse to play it.

Bringing this vent back to questioning the value of therapy, at least for some people, how are you supposed to push through circumstances that aren't ever going to get better, without deluding yourself that you'll win the lottery or have some other movie-like, deus ex machina intervention to make things better? Talking about your problems doesn't solve them. And not every problem is solvable. So in those cases are the choices to suck it up and just take it, or refuse to play the game of life with it's crappy, inconsistently applied rules?

tldr; therapy is about making you feel better about your circumstances, not making your circumstances better. So what if it's not possible to be happy because your circumstances themselves are always going to be unhappy ones? What good is therapy then?",1713232035.0,

redditreader_aitafan,My therapist is fed up.,2,1c576ie,1,"I've been seeing her weekly since the beginning of last August. I knew her previously, my husband and I used her for marriage counseling at the suggestion of a friend about 9 years ago. It didn't last, he lost his job and with it his insurance, but I chose her because she seemed to see through my husband. 

Husband is a narcissist. She calls him a sociopath. I explained when I first started that I wanted to work through all the trauma from before husband so that I could better mentally and emotionally handle leaving him because I know he's going to burn my life down when I leave. 

Since I started, she keeps everything in the now, like how are things *now* and I talk about what's happened in the week since I've seen her. I realize that at least every other week, I'm talking about some new shit my husband is putting me through or something with my kids that isa direct result of his influence, but that's not what I want to talk about. I bring up the past and we don't really do anything with it. She just tells me it was abuse and shaped how I am now and I get that, I already knew that, that's why I'm in therapy. 

I don't know what to do. Today is at least the third time she's seriously brought up that she doesn't know how to help me. She thinks I need to leave my husband and then we'll deal with the fallout. I think that I'm not in the same place I was 20 years ago, living in survival mode. I think that I'm ready to deal with some stuff so that I can reconnect my body with my feelings. I am constantly dissociated and I'm afraid jumping out of this marriage right now makes everything worse. She doesn't address that. 

I understand that maybe I can't heal from the abuse from my husband until I'm out the door, but my mother was a narcissist and my father was physically abusive. I was neglected and abused growing up. Can't I deal with that trauma first? I'm a mess right now. I have so many triggers and some are paralyzing. I have discovered a repressed memory but I can't quite access all of it. I wasn't living like this 20 years ago. I got sick 8 years ago and it's taken me until the last year to recover. I don't love my husband and I know I need to leave, but can't we do some prep work for that? 

I don't know how to proceed. She's very clearly frustrated that I won't just get a lawyer and get out. I have tried to explain logistics, she says they'll work out. I'm afraid of losing my health insurance as it's through my husband, I want to work out as much trauma as I can before he spite-quits his job to avoid paying child support and alimony. Isn't there some work we can do in the meantime???

I am a junior in college, and as you could imagine the past couple years have been pretty stressful ones, but this current semester is especially rough. I‚Äôve been having a lot of stress and have also struggled with sleeping enough. I think these things are leading to weird mental stress, and it‚Äôs causing me to have tons of guilt/anxiety/self hate about thoughts (key thing here is thoughts, not actions) I had when I was in the first half of my teens. I won‚Äôt go into what exactly these thoughts were, but there were just a few, with each probably occurring no more than twice. they were all very sexual things that would not be considered ok by most (that includes myself) no obsession/fixation ever occurred with these thoughts and I never had the slightest urge to make them anything besides a thought. This phase of hyper sexual thoughts (a majority of which were perfectly normal) lasted if I had to guess from 14-16 (now 21.) Since then to now I‚Äôve been totally normal with no regard to those very few disturbing thoughts. I lead a normal life and have a very healthy relationship and sex life. I‚Äôm so confused why years later bad thoughts I had as a teen are coming back and wreaking havoc on my brain?!

During the pandemic  years I lost my mother to a brain aneurysm and I can't shake guilt for not being able to save her or the poor improvised medical treatment the 911 agent instructed me through. It's been almost 4 years now and im still constantly plagued by thoughts of maybe id still have my mom if I controlled my adrenaline better or didn't freak out or since I'm in the medical field I failed to recognize the warning signs of an aneurysm. Instead she brutally passed away in my arms. I only seem to find a break from the thoughts when I'm asleep but even then I still have nights where I relive the entire event. I'm on anti-depressants, xanax, and almost non-stop weed vaporization and nothing helps.

Does therapy even work for everyone or am I just screwed?

they are very much not emotionally aware. i dont think my dad even realizes it, but hes also affected by my mom in the way i want to talk about too. this is a big reason my dad gets so mad at her. she tries her hardest to be the center of attention all the time. for example, shell interrupt conversations shes not a part of with irrelevant or useless questions, that dont contribute to the discussion. or sometimes shell pretend to have bad hearing or something and she obnoxiously asks ""what??"" ""WHAT?"" to try and force herself in. she speaks really loudly all the time. she pokes me and talks to me and tries to grab my attention all the time. she tries to ""help"" me with EVERYTHING. if im trying to change the temperature of the AC, she will run over and instruct me how to do it and stare at me until i do it. and then she insists ""let me do it. just let me do it."" when i talk with her she almost always out of breath and tries to speak at every moment possible and tries to make conversations about her. she tries to grab mya ttention all the time. its very exhausting and overwhelming and frustrating.

didn‚Äôt think that I had blocked memories until a few years ago when some weird things came back up from my childhood.

So this other stuff thats bubbled up from before that always seemed really minor but now I‚Äôm starting to wonder if it‚Äôs bigger than I made it out to be.) 

First, my childhood best friend used to show me his penis and encourage me to touch him about every time I saw him. We were like 7-8 when this happened. He would take me to his clubhouse away from the adults and he‚Äôd touch me and I‚Äôd touch him. I remember feeling uncomfortable by the experience because I‚Äôd confided in an adult and they spelled out to me that it was wrong. So even though I didn‚Äôt want to my friend would push for it anyways. We were both kids so this never felt like something as extreme as molestation. Just a morally gray experience. 

Then a few years later, I had a strange experience with my cousin. He was 12 and I was 10 and he would ‚Äúpractice kissing‚Äù on me. He‚Äôs take me to the bathroom and kiss me pretty intimately. This happened for a few months before his mom caught us and put a stop to it. I never really thought that it was bad, like I didn‚Äôt feel like I was in danger and a few years later he came out of the closet so I suspected maybe he was using me to figure out if he had any interest in girls. 

Anyways the stuff I experienced after all this was way way worse. Like full blown SA and abuse. So these things from childhood just were swept away in my mind. I wonder now though if these experiences contributed to my freeze response that I have now.

I am 15, I turn 16 this year, and basically anything that can go wrong in my life has indeed gone wrong. I suffer from anxiety and insecurity. I don't like the way I am, or how I look. Everything bothers me, from loud noises and big crowds, to complete silence and emptiness, it all bothers me to the point where I get panicked and hyperventilate. 6 or 7 years ago, I lost my grandmother to an unexpected heart attack. None of us saw it coming since she had never experienced any health problems and obviously, it hit us all hard. 

Just under 5 years ago, I was sexually harassed by an adult man. I was 11. I never told anyone out of fear of not being believed.

Recently, I've lost both my nana and my dad to cancer. I've lost all motivation to get out of bed, I've been labelled as 'lazy'. I used to enjoy art and drawing, now I can't even pick up a sketchbook. I don't enjoy it anymore. I don't enjoy anything I used to love anymore.

I'll be honest, I don't want to live anymore. Everything just hurts, it feels like things are only getting worse during what people call the best years of my life. I've had people dismiss my feelings because I'm a teenager, and it just hurts. Sometimes I just wonder why I'm still here. My sister hates me, my friends left me for someone else, my uncle won't even look at me anymore. I sometimes wish I just disappeared, but I'm afraid. I'm not afraid of death itself, but the consequences **others** will suffer if I do actually do something.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I was put on a list for a therapist when my grandmother died bit that never happened. I have no one to talk to. I don't want to burden anyone in my family with my problems, but I just need to talk to someone. This is all genuinely affecting my health. I'm sick almost all the time, I feel sad a lot, I'm extremely underweight. I'm failing at everything.

I know this is a long rant, it could be longer, but I'd be here all day if I added any more. I just needed to get all of this off my chest, even if it's to a bunch of Internet strangers.

I'm estranged from my Mother for a few years now. Most recently during EMDR I pieced together memories that both parents SA me.

Unfortunately because I didn't figure this out until my 50's but adult sons have a relationship with her.

When my son and his wife were pregnant with their first child (my first grandchild) I made the decision I needed to tell them about my Mother. My father has been completely out of my life since the 1990's. So all my adult children know and so do their spouses.

Fast forward and the baby will be baptised in a few months (we are not religious,  its more of a traditional thing/family celebration). 

I've said to my son that the stress of seeing my Mother at events is too much for me and I won't be able to attend. It basically writes of a year of my life to very bad PTSD. Which then aggrevates another health condition (ME). I did it for their weddings but just can't do it for anything else. I've explained this to my son. 

My son is going ahead with the christening, inviting my Mother. I've said again that I'm sorry but can't attend. My son says he'd like me there.

I was thinking of suggesting (to my son) my mother goes to the ceremony but doesn't attend the celebration afterwards - so I could attend that part and so still share part of this day. I have no idea if my mother would comply with this - she doesn't react well to boundaries.

But another (probably childish) part of me is thinking I don't want anything to do with a christening/celebration that tolerates a child abuser being there and I don't want to risk she just pushes herself forward and shows up to the after celebration.

Appreciate your thoughts.

Honestly, I wish she'd just hurry up and die. I am so tired of dealing with the fallout of the abuse.",1713164040.0,

Last week he upped the booster to 7.5 mg and to get that dose, I needed to split a pill. I couldn't find my pill cutter, so I used a knife, which ended up crushing the Adderall. At this point, I decided to take a card, crush it completely, and arrange it in a line as if I were preparing to snort it.

Ok_Pop5911,Allocation of romantic-sexual-rational feelings in relationships,1,1c42egu,1,"For romantic part i like well raised women, mainly those from Germanic countries or North-America who have vivid imagination, unselfish feeling to do good and spirit that resonates.  
  
For sexual part i have way stronger excitement toward nearly aggressive flirty women. Mainly those from Latin-America (Brazil and Venezuela mainly) or Middle-Eastern countries as Morocco, Tunisia etc.  
  
My rational choice to have children with however was Chinese woman with who daily life is awesome intellectually, without problems, stupid arguments or delusions.  
  
I blame this firstly for my early sexualization, basically since kindergarten i had gradually more and more serious sexual and emotional interaction with opposite sex. We played a lot with boys since 7-years old without adult supervise and did not share everything with adults. Like talked about having first boner in the first year of school for Spice girls in that music video where they jump on tables and some years after about bustin nut and \*censored\* in mixed gender group. In the age of 13 already had dozens of sexual intercourses and tbh probably at least hundred of serious crushes. Already in this age rrrromantic and sexual interest started to diverse slightly. Idea that God, heaven and all old relatives see me all the time and that sexual interest is only to spread seed into your Eve slowly shifted to separated hedonist pleasure which sometimes was not to loved one. In this age it was still perfectly fine to get into highest sexual climax can imagine with the crush. Secondly after meeting females while travelling, university, fetish groups, house parties or sometimes even just creeping in public parks or in language change websites I started to start either sexual relationships or partnerships which either consist romantic or platonic love. In sexual relationships i often even did not like the other partner at all as something strong aggressive relationship turned into super horny premature climax. So those purely hedonist-sex relationships were like sugar which fried out the sexual feeling from romantic. Or at least that¬¥s my strong guess. While living abroad i often times found women to date from different cultures and especially from conservative religious groups who are sexually and romantically match but still rational choice. One reason why i ended up with Chinese woman is probably due first perfect matches i found as girlfriends, soulmates or whatsoever. That was when i was in age of 18-21. After dated Jewish and American girls, even for years and lived abroad. Lastly i shifted dating German. Somehow i feel that this split of having romantic and sexual feelings polarized due nationality, background etc. could be because of childish things as watching Smallville all seasons about two times and having crush on Chloe or other German produced series for youth but sure it have to do with real characteristics. Sexual obsession to certain girls is probably due extremely sexually intellectual feminine flirtations individuals who give conflicted feelings in conflicted situations.  
  
After all what had happened i am kind of romanto-sexoholic as alcoholics are alcoholics. I can quit any dishonourable sex and romantic infidelity but when you snap a pint it always hits back.  
  
Does anyone of you have similar problem as I, that romantic, sexual and rational feelings can not be the highest with one woman?",1713124246.0,

AbrocomaDue2087,I think Im misdiagnosed and idk how to tell my therapist,0,1c40wcz,5,"Hello! First of all, I didnt know what to write in the title to summarize my problem but Ill explain here better.

I started therapy a few months ago, I chose CBT after a bad experience with a gestalt therapist and after doing some research, thinking it would be better because it would let me focus on specific problems and work on them more effectively. I also saw on their website that they first do some sort of testing to see what you need to work on and I looked forward to that because Im not really sure what my most important problem is or what diagnosis I might have. Ive just been feeling bad, esp when my partner and I get into a fight its very heated and I often have breakdowns even if its just a simple conflict, plus I had a traumatic experience 2 years ago that I didnt work on that much as I was mostly in survival mode till now so I knew I needed therapy to proccess everything, just not for what exactly. 

When I came, the therapists daughter who is in training talked to me and asked me what Im having problems with and I just started naming things, the traumatic experience, my overall anxiety my whole life, not being able to control my emotions (fights etc) etc and she gave me a bunch of tests mostly about anxiety and 1 for depression. I get the results and it ends up being an anxiety disorder and a mild depression, fair enough, and she told me well be working on anxiety and also emotional regulation, which was what I thougjt I needed help with the most.

After that I started going to therapy with my actual therapist and she just went on with anxiety and weve been working on that for a few months but Im not really aure about this now. Ive been managing my anxiety on my own quite okayish, whatever she advised me to do till now I have already tried and even more than she advised sometimes and now Im realizing that its not really that big of a deal actually. Ive also been reading and thinking that maybe its not actually anxiety but some sort of autism, but I dont know if I should or how to bring that up. Also realized lately that I probably have a lot of pent up anger and I have anger problems maybe that are the core of every other problem that I have on the daily basis and I should focus on that. But the thing is, she told me that we have planned topics for every session, homework and all that and after a year well do the tests again to see if its better, and whenever I try to talk about somethinf else, she goes back to anxiety and every session starts with her asking me about my interactions with people and my journey with amxiety in correlation to them. 

Im starting to feel like her daughter didnt really do a great job, maybe didnt listen to me  that much, or maybe they took what I said first that my problem was and went with it, when I think that there are bigger underlying problems that I myself am not aware of but I came there to find out. Also the tests I did are similar to things I already did online before and I dont think theyre too effective, they seem pretty general and not what I expected from a therapist and after paying quite a sum of money for it. 

Now I decided to tell my therapist about this, maybe tell her that I would like to work om anger issues more than amxiety but that would maybe require starting all over again, doing tests again etc but maybe they dont do.things that way? Maybe in CBT they expect you to come with a problem and not wait for them to find it? I have no idea and no relevant experience to know.

I dont know what to do in this situation so Im seeking some clarification regarding CBT in general and how it works, and what is the best way to go about this? What if I dont really have problems with anger and I realize that again after 2 momths of working on it? Im also really scared of any kind of confrontation and telling this to my therapist is a bit scary and Im really anxious.

Thank you so much in advance and I hope its clear what Im trying to say. Also sorry for my english, its not my first language so I dont know how to say some things and they might sound weird, but I hope you get the point.",1713120573.0,

Throughout my earlier childhood I had a lot of adverse (in particular sexually adverse) experiences, and a lot of it involved my family. It was never rape or for the motive that they were attracted to me or anything, and the reason I consider it sexual abuse (in terms of it's affects on me) is just because of the context of me being transgender (female to male/genderqueer). Some things included my mom spanking me with a thick wooden rod that even cracked before because of how hard I was spanked, often for the reason of me being uncomfortable wearing feminine clothes like panties; my now deceased grandma making comments about the size of my genital area and slapping me there for fun(?) or like in a pinching your cheeks kind of way (but obviously more boundary crossing); and also my general thoughts of wanting to be sexually abused by men because of feeling undesirable in my body as a gay trans guy. 

These are all things that have led to me today being very uncomfortable in my relationships with others, and have led me to getting into very toxic relationships, and feeling a sense of disgust towards my body that manifests in me letting people hurt me. Since I'm still currently a minor, I'm not sure if it's ok for me to discuss these sexual type topics with my therapist or if it would be too weird, or if they'd report some of these things (which I really don't want).

Some other things have been my parents promoting very disordered eating, like saying starving yourself or throwing up is good, but still providing food despite these frequent comments.

NatureGeo,Hiw to accept and reduce impact of shame?,4,1c31ufo,8,"Hi, everyone. üëã Nowadays, I am reading a book, where shame is described as the core emotion that impacts lives of gay men. While my own experiences do not completely resonate with all described examples, I started to uncover some sources of shame within me.:

Shame of not having a strong (emotional) connection with my father

Shame of being hypersensitive

Shame of craving connection and intimacy with other men (almost certain I'm gay, but remain open-minded about this)

Shame of not having a stable career and relationships

Shame about making stupid financial decisions in my 20s

Accepted shame that was projected by bullies.

I would appreciate some advice on how to open the way for acceptance and reducing impact of shame in daily life. Usually, shame manifests (not to the extreme) within me in a form of resentment of new connections, anxiety, emotional outbursts (verbal), feeling unvaluable, unheard, loneliness. I'm not very extroverted or feel a strong need to overcomenpsate. At the core, I am caring and loving, but sometimes get blindfolded by emotions and become indifferent and closed off (just like some people treat(-ed) me before).

Reading some literature has helped me to look at some of situations in my life in new ways. Discovering the power of shame has made me curious about how this emotion could have impact my experiences up till now. However, accepting and reducing that shame would probably be beneficial for improving my situation and allow growth as a person.",1713014510.0,

My therapist at the time (first session) diagnosed me with agoraphobia and PTSD ( I was groomed by a friend's parent). She has two medical condition, diabetes and the other condition where she would just sleep all the time.I started noticing how much she cancels or how late she is. And get this, sometimes she would not even tell me, I would have to ask where she is. And the people pleaser I am, I accepted it. She told me April 2023, I wasn't making any progress. Instead I was moving like a snail and had to be put on medication. This really bugged me because she wasn't even at therapy every week. Whenever I would want to share her an experience I had, she would interrupt and start talking.  

Flash forward to 2024, I think it was March. Anyways I had enough of her canceling and basically let her know she canceled over 20 times.

At the end of the day, I do not want to pay for driving lessons when I already have my license. So this session she told me that this is my fault. And the thing that b broke my heart was when I was talking about my dog, and her stool. I told her it had some blood in it, so we might need to go to the vet. And she said, well you have to prepare she is 10, she might not be here any longer. And that I need to grieve now so it won't be bad when she passes??? And then after all all of, she looks at me.

Keepmakingaccounts,Siblings romantic delusions getting validated by therapist,3,1c30fm7,0,"Her therapist is new/still in the supervisory stage but she‚Äôs not the best at her job.

My sister has delusions about one her exes. To her he‚Äôs the love of her life, perfect in every way/the perfect man, her ‚Äùsoulmate‚Äù etc

You might thing that sounds sweet but it is very jarring to hear in person. And the tone of her voice when she says it is like there‚Äôs no room for debate. they only dated for a very brief period and he broke up with her. They had not spoke in two years

She got in shape and has improved her anxiety. And all of a sudden he wants her again. 

It was delusional to think he was her perfect soulmate after a few months of dating, worse still when she said it after her break up. But now years later he crawls back and she still believes he‚Äôs perfect. And it probably sounds like I‚Äôm being a hater but it‚Äôs genuinely concerning how high of a pedestal she puts this guy on. 

And her therapist encouraged her to get back together with him. So while it‚Äôs clear to me the delusions never went away, instead of shelving them/or working through them, she‚Äôs essentially being encouraged to engage with them/having them validated.

Maybe because she‚Äôs a young woman the therapist isn‚Äôt taking romantic delusions as seriously as she should, or she‚Äôs too inexperienced to realize the compounding issues in the whole situation. Maybe my sister lies to her  or doesnt share her delusional thoughts idk.

I‚Äôm really concerned tho, because when reality hits it‚Äôs going to be harder for her to build herself back up again. Or her delusions will escalate. So I really need advice on how to support her. But also get her out of these delusions",1713010103.0,

EloquentFredGullet,Dad likes retelling the time I almost got taken by CPS,3,1c2uxde,2,"Very long and has child beating trigger warning

On my mom‚Äôs birthday and we ate at a very nice restaurant. My family, friends, and my girlfriend all sat together at a round table. My dad‚Äôs favorite topics are how I, the oldest son, used to get in trouble. To be fair, quite a few of the stories he tells are very funny. One in particular, however, always rubs me the wrong way as it‚Äôs the only story he doesn‚Äôt tell in full. He gets his laughs, It ticks me off, my girlfriend noticed I‚Äôm upset, and when we‚Äôre on the way home, she asked why. I didn‚Äôt expect it bring back some emotions I didn‚Äôt know I still had.

All throughout my school years, I was physically punished, whipped and publicly humiliated. Dad didn‚Äôt like the term ‚Äúbeating‚Äù because he didn‚Äôt hit me with a closed fist or leave me bloody, but no matter what new name he gave it, it felt like a beating. To this day I think I deserved almost every beating, because I was (some would say that I still am) a troublemaker. However, there was one time that was especially bad that I don‚Äôt think I deserved.

When I was in elementary school I did something really bad: I called my teacher a witch. Was almost home free too, but she eavesdropped on me talking with my friend on the way to the bus.

(Of course as an adult I now know it was wrong and I was just lashing out to lash out. She did nothing wrong and was a sweet teacher, even if she was rude and gave me an F for not showing my work even though I was right.)

Teacher reasonably calls my dad who is upset with me. This time, however, was really bad because he just had his own bad day. He took out his belt like he normally does and whipped my butt blue and a little bloody. Worst whipping of my life. He made me write a letter to my teacher and I thought that‚Äôd be it. But then it got worse.

I couldn‚Äôt sit down. For three classes, I was unable to sit in my chair and if I did I‚Äôd cry. It hurt too much. My third teacher, the teacher I called a witch, saw that I was in pain, asked why I couldn‚Äôt sit down, and I told her that it‚Äôs because my dad whipped me.

During lunch, one of my teachers took me to the front office to meet with these two guys I‚Äôve never seen before. My first three teachers were also there as well as the principle. They took me to this back room and asked me a lot of questions. I told them honestly what happened and how often I get whipped, which was often because I liked to talk back at my parents. 

They had me pull down my pants a bit and I still to this day remember someone in the room gasping. They took pictures and said it was gonna be ok. I didn‚Äôt tell my parents because I was scared about being whipped again.

The next night CPS came to my house. Threatened to take me and my siblings. Dad and mom assured them that everything was ok and that it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. A ‚Äúlapse‚Äù I believe is what was said. Dad blamed me for weeks about how embarrassed he was. Couldn‚Äôt look at me. It soon became a dig at me he‚Äôd say from time to time and evolved to a funny story about how I almost got taken by CPS. Gets quite a bit of laughs and he tells it often. Troublemaking son over exaggerated a butt whipping.

Some good did come from it though. He never whipped me or my siblings that hard again. It got to the point that he‚Äôd just ground us and take our doors off their hinges instead of hitting. Youngest two siblings never even got to see his belt unless he was showing it off as the only way to keep me in check. Reality is that it didn‚Äôt actually work and I continued to cause trouble up until I graduated.

My gf is utterly upset now that she has the context. Says I need to tell him off. Which I would if I were a bit more younger. Obviously I still care, but I just don‚Äôt have the same fight in me like I used to. I just make sure the right people know the real story.

I'm in my second year of a levels at the moment and feel permanently stressed and unhappy. I'm aware of issues that I have but am completely undiagnosed for anything (I suspect autism). 

I have been seeing a therapist who has been pretty useless and keeps cancelling on me. I've been wanting to work on my social anxiety which has got increasingly worse over the past year and a bit. 

It feels at the moment like at any point in my life I cannot enjoy it because I am just dreading the next social event, and there always is one. I keep telling myself to just get through this next one and then anorher one pops up. 

I am writing this before going to a party today and I feel unable to anything before. 

This is effecting my whole life and makes me question if I'll ever be able to get a girlfriend because I just can't talk to other people well.

People often talk about how easy I was to talk to and stuff in the past and this only makes it harder for me as I know I can no longer live up to their expectations.

The problems are arguably worse when my parents are around because I use them as a crutch in social situations. 

I genuinely have very few people who I can really have a proper conversation with, probably about one in fact. Although I feel this is unhealthy as my mood almost entirely depends upon him and his happiness. If he is off with me or down I feel very down myself. 

I guess I want to form that kind of connection with more people but I really struggle so am too dependent on that one person.

I'm not sure this makes any sense at this point but if you can understand anything from it I would really appreciate your advice. Should I be seeking medication? Anything in particular I should focus on etc?

But for some reason i still feel comfort in solitude and hate investing energy and time in knowing other people. I am living in a dysfunctional family,faced abuse which doesn't help me either. I still feel numb but it has improved from a year i would say. Only coping mechanism is to listen to music,watch comedy videos,journalling and going for walk.  
I literally don't have a single person in my life whom i can call my friend with whom i can trust completely and expression my emotions and happiness. I am in late 20's which is kind of difficult to even make friends.

One of those things is that I literally can't handle being viewed as ""less than"".

I think this may be a ""critical issue"". As in, I think a lot of things stem from this.

When people don't text me back for 1+ hours I assume I'm one of the least important things in their life. When I am not the best at something at my job I work day and night to be the best. At parties, if no one wants to talk to me it is a dark night for me. When my gf flirts with other people I assume I'm not interesting or attractive enough. When she immediately moves on to someone in better shape and more interesting than me I am positive that's the case.

I know this is not healthy, but, I can't help continually trying to be the best at my job, best looking, smartest, the only one my gf wants, the most interesting, etc...

Obviously I get burnt out from time to time, but honestly, being viewed as ""less than"" hurts SO much more than burnout.

That's when I felt empty and was looking for a hook up. 

I went on dating apps and matched a guy who claimed to be sexually dom and eluded a lot of dominance too. I never had such a strong sexual chemistry, longing to fee safe and protected with him, like a fantasy come true.. Butat the same time, I was deeply mistrustful and scared. We were going to meet the day after and I felt like I'm acting impulsively and didn't feel grounded at all. Next day, he freaked out when I didn't respond within one hour, he showed zero empathy, talked down on me and other guys, unmatched me immediately (narcissistic behaviors?). I cancelled our meeting and was shaken. But my problem is that I still experience the longing on and off. Those moments I have a strong urge to reach out to him and at the same time fear and strong mistrust. I also had nightmares of him. But especially when I'm in the ""addiction bubble"" I crave him and the only thing I fear is physical harm, but not the emotionalo one, then when I orgasmed I just want to stay away from him at all costs.

She is totally broken and not only does she not want to go back to work but she does not want to continue living. 

She says that her life is hell and that they are coming for her again, that something is happening and that it is not her imagination.

I have been his partner since before that happened to him and I have experienced these episodes before but never this strongly. 

What can I do? She doesn't believe the psychologist can help her because she doesn't believe it's in her mind. Is this ptsd or schizophrenia?

DeceasedThinking,Should I get a new therapist?,1,1c22se5,0,"At the beginning of the year I started DBT in a partial hospitalization program. The program itself was really awesome and I finished the program being very excited to continue. I've been in and out of psych wards and had therapists in the past, but this was the one thing that felt like I was actually making progress.

  
Because I was the only PHP, I was put on the back burner for getting a therapist, which was part of the program. Every week the residents (who I was in class with) would take time to see both a therapist and the psychiatrist. I got to see the psychiatrist and I was supposed to see a therapist, but I never got one. I asked multiple times and every time I brought it up to staff they seemed shocked and said they would see about it. I'm understanding that sometimes things slip through the cracks... I mean... I'm at DBT, slipping through the cracks is my life experience.

  
Still, it took almost the entire month to finally get me in with a therapist. On my second to last day I got to talk to her over the computer and we started my onboard process. It's pretty thorough so I was understanding that it might take a bit. I took a whole hour long session just going over my history.   
After I was out of the program though it became harder for me to get to the building because I moved away from the town it was in. I knew I would still be seeing her, but I didn't realize that part of the program was still more group sessions and that there was still a ton more paperwork to go over. So many of the residents are from out of state that I didn't think me moving away would be a problem.

  
We've missed some sessions between me not realizing the day/time and her being busy, so on occasion we've had actual sessions to catch up, but we're also still doing paperwork stuff. She asked me to come in to the office, so I went out of my way to make sure I would be able to only for the entire hour to be about going over expectations and paperwork. Again, I get it, I want to heal, but it's April and we started at the end of January (and I had been without a therapist for two months before that) and I feel like we've not even done much actual therapy work. I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong start entirely and to be honest, I'm losing the dedication to keep going because I feel like I'm not getting anything out of it. I'm not afraid to put in the work, but part of me wonders if I'm being too rash or trying to avoid a conflict where I could be in the wrong.

  
I plan on talking to her about it tomorrow, but a friend of mine also suggested maybe we just weren't the right fit. A therapist relative of mine suggested I get a second therapist just to talk to regularly and keep my DBT one for skills training, but I don't know if I want to commit more time when previously I was happy with the once a week sessions. She wants me to come in to the office more, but that's two hours more out of my day to get a ride there and back, especially when I don't drive and would have to get a bus. If I felt like I did while I was in the program, I'd probably be more willing to commit to it, but now it just seems like a bother to wake up earlier and lose more time in my day.

  
I guess I just need an outside perspective to see all the facts. I feel like I'm doubting myself in some way and then also not taking responsibility in another. ",1712905662.0,

Vegetable-Area3143,How do I tell my husband about my childhood SA by family member?,3,1c1vgm2,0,"To start I could write a novel about my childhood traumas. My father had years long affairs, often forgot to pick me up places, and definitely has an undiagnosed mental illness (bipolar or BPD is my best guess). My mother always making excuses for him, telling us not to expect apologies it‚Äôs just how he is, etc. My mother had my brother at 18 and he is very obviously her favourite child. He then had a child at 19, who is now as you could guess her favourite grandchild. We have never treated the same. He is 6 years older than me and although never said out loud we have different fathers. His sports more important than my activities, they would never miss a game of his. But missing mine was a regular weekend occurrence. My fathers family is very Catholic, I was forced to participate in various religious ceremonies while he didn‚Äôt have to go at all. Because of these divides we were never close. 

When I was 5 years old my brother molested me for the first time he, he was 12. This became and on going occurrence. We would be home alone after school which is when he would Sexually assault me and force me to preform terrible acts on him. Eventually he would come into my bed in the night and continue this for the next 2 or so years. Again I was 5. Well I knew something was wrong I didn‚Äôt know how to explain what. And he made it very clear I was to never tell anyone. 

Eventually he went to High school and we were rarely alone and it stopped. I think as a coping skill my mind blocked it out. When I was a teenager learning more about sex is when I realized what had really happened to me and how horribly wrong it was. As much as I wanted cry and scream I kept it all in. It would ruin my family, people would judge me, it was my fault for not realizing it then, all terrible thoughts I had. Braids my mother made it very clear we were to always appear happy and prefect to the world. I struggled with my mental health for years. Abused substances and allowed boys to treat me terribly in relationships. I moved out for college the second I could. 

I met my now husband almost a decade ago he I truly my rock and helped me heal and get stable in life. He knows I was sexually assaulted but I never gave the details. My parents care for our children one day every two weeks, after a Christmas blow up a couple years ago resulting in my brother calling me names and screaming I stopped talking to him‚Ä¶. I know let myself be around him too long. Our kids are not to be around him or his house. My mother keeps breaking this rule.

hollyhockaurora,Therapist hurting my feelings and making me feel attacked,2,1c1ug9v,0,"Hey guys. I'm not sure what to do. My husband and I have been seeing a couple's therapist for almost a year. Last week, I kind of had a nervous breakdown during the session because because work was really stressful, I was having medical issues, and I hadn't slept the whole night. I could tell throughout the session that the therapist was annoyed with me.  After I started having a breakdown (I have never ever broken down in a therapy session like this, btw), She had us do a deep breathing exercise which is great, but during the exercise she accused me of not doing the exercise properly. I told her I was having heart pain (she was supposed to be aware of my heart condition, but I think she forgot). I told her ""I can't, it's making my heart hurt."" She said ""Stop making excuses."" This made me really upset, and although I didn't tell her this at the time, it affected the rest of our session and I kept vocillating between crying and getting upset the rest of the session. It was a disaster of a session, which was my fault. I could tell the therapist was really upset at me by the end. I felt terrible later on for disrupting our session so much with my nervous breakdown. I thought about quitting the therapy because she had really offended me, but I decided to stick it through, because my husband was upset at me for wanting to quit just because of this one incident.

We came back this week, I was feeling myself again, but she said she wanted to sit down with us individually. She sat down with me first, and gave me a list of things she thought I was doing which were hurting therapy. First, she called me manipulative and said that I had no ability to ""own"" my problems. I asked her for examples because neither she nor my husband had ever mentioned anything like this to me before. She did not have any examples. We proceeded to get into an argument about why she could not provide more examples, and she therapisted-herself into winning this argument somehow by saying ""I don't need to make a record, it's something I've observed during all of our sessions"".

I told her that I feel like she doesn't like me since last session, and I also informed her that she had made me upset at the last session about the heart pain thing. She told me it is manipulative to bring up something negative about someone after they bring up something negative about you, and also said she would never say anything like ""stop making excuses"" and would never say anything like that during a breathing exercise.

I told her that I was feeling attacked. She said that this is just protocol; that she always terminates clients by bringing them in individually to talk to them (I believe this is probably standard practice). She proceeded to continue highlighting the issues I had and why it was causing couples therapy to not work. I tried to go get my husband to come in so that he could hear her say these bad things about me, because at this point I simply could not believe I was being attacked like this. I had never been talked to like this before.

My husband was instantly really pissed off at me for violating the therapist's wishes to see us separately, and refused to join me in my session. I gave up, and let him have his turn.

I'm not sure what to do. I calmed down and was friendly by the end, but she really pissed me off. I'm not sure what she and my husband talked about individually at all, he won't tell me. 
Do couples therapists tell their clients all the things they are doing wrong at the end, and never bring them up during any of the other appointments? Is that normal? She never ever once told me I was being manipulative, let alone not in a kind way. It was like a ""fuck you, and also I'm not going to see you anymore""

Should I be upset at my husband for taking her side? Am I overreacting? Has anyone had similar experience to this in therapy? And most importantly, where do I go from here? Do I need to break up with my husband because he took her side? Do I speak with the manager at the therapy clinic about my concerns?

Lastly, was she genuinely trying to tell me that I am a manipulative person? My dad was manipulative, and it hurts me to think that I could be. But no one, no exes, not even my husband, has ever once called me manipulative. Or does she simply not like me and was pissed off?

One more thing (thank you if you got this far) We are both artists by profession. Our jobs revolve around art, and we talk about it a lot in session. In the last session, when we mentioned the art, she said ""you guys are artists?? That's so cool!""

Our relationship lasted for 4 years. It's been 1 year and 3 months since my breakup, and 8 months since I completely stopped talking to her.

I wasn't able to do things due to my depression, but I was trying. I still miss her daily; she's in my thoughts 24/7. I barely sleep peacefully, and I barely function. At first, I was so motivated to get over it, but as time passes and I see no improvements, it's getting worse. Each day, her memories come flooding back to me. Every moment we spent together, each day I remember her betrayal, each day I hope things will be fine, each day I try to be kind to her and to myself, each day I fight the thought that she was wrong to leave me, because I still love her, and my rational thinking always gets in the way. It's like I'm stuck, and I don't know how to heal. I've tried many things, but something is holding me back. When I look at how much time has passed, my hope starts to diminish.

I really like my gf and when we started dating we were both looking for something serious that could potentially lead to marriage. I was fine with having one maybe two kids, because even though I think kids are cool, they are a ton of work and cost a lot. 

I've been doing more research and realized that even though I make pretty good money as an engineer, I may not be able to buy a home and save for retirement while raising a child. This bothers me a lot.

There is also the issue that she is about to be 30 and I am don't want her to be older than 35 when we start trying to have a family.

How do I go about deciding on whether or not to have kids ? I also might hate myself for not having any and being 44 and very financially comfortable since I didn't have kids with my wifem

To give some background information. Some time ago my mom noticed a lump on her breast and we thought it might be non cancerous but recently shes become extremely weak. She can‚Äôt even climb the stairs anymore. She can barely get up from bed. Her hands are very cold and shes nauseous, she has stomach pain, and she can‚Äôt eat anything. Every time she does she feels nauseous and she essentially forces herself to eat something these days and shes become very weak also shes incredibly yellow. Like very yellow. I was so surprised when i saw her in clear light and i couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. It‚Äôs jaundice (if thats how you spell it)

We thought it might be liver stones or something liver related so my mom went to get an ultrasound and they found out that her liver is enlarged and she also has a lump or something on her breast.

She‚Äôll go for another check up for an official diagnosis. It‚Äôs not confirmed that the liver issue and the breast lump is connected and its also not confirmed that the breast lump is cancerous but my dad who is a doctor and who also went with my mom to get the check up done says the chances are high.

Still i hope that it isn‚Äôt cancer and my mom is completely fine and that she will get healthy quickly but every time i see my mom i feel like breaking down in tears.

I turned 20 yesterday. I got kicked out of school when i was 17 and i gave up on life after that. I don‚Äôt have any friends anymore since i cut contact from everyone. My family is all i have and i love them so much even though i have disappointed my mom so much she still loves me. Shes the greatest mom i could ever ask for and i am the worst son. I regret everything i have ever done in my life.

I have been crying alone downstairs because it hurts so much i can barely take the pain. I keep imagining going back in time and doing things differently and not being a disappointment. Even though my mom has never said i am a disappointment i still feel like one because i know she wanted me to be like my dad and go to med school and shes always sad because shes scared for my future.

canada_chick_69,Couples therapy ,1,1c1mg05,0,"This is a very odd situation. My husband asked for a separation this year. We are married and were together 17 years. 2 children.  Keep in mind we are both in our mid 30's. Within 3 weeks of the separation he started having a long distant relationship with someone he has never met. I figured it was a distraction tactic for him to use to run from the heeling and problem at hand, I still think it is. 
From the start I asked him to go to counseling or therapy with me. He wouldn't. 
Now yesterday he made the calls, got the quotes, inquired about couples therapy and we have it set to start couples therapy within the next month. He seems pretty excited as am I.
I told him to be honest with his LDR about this, tell her everything he told me, just so everyone was honest and open. 
Therapy may help us rekindle our marriage (there was no abuse of any kind, no infidelity, we got along great, it was just a matter of lack of communication), or it may end up that we are just amazing friends after this. I of course want to fight for our marriage more than he currently does. But I feel having her from the start of the healing process is hindering his heeling and thoughts. 
We agreed we will go into this with no walls up, no expectations, no hindrance from anyone else. So I asked him if he was still in a LDR. He said yes. So how is that not supposed to hinder any decisions made during/after therapy? If we find better ways to communicate, how does having a girlfriend still throughout therapy, possibly help our marriage and self heeling and not hinder any decisions? 

Shouldn't we both enter this with no commitments to anybody?

I feel like those almost 2 years and all that money was completely wasted and I am in the same place than before. The talking about past experiences opened so much wounds again from the past, which led to me having almost no contact with my family.

I then took a few months break from therapy and started searching again, but I cant seem to find a therapist I like. I also can never really say after the first hour if I want to continue or not because for me it is way too short to tell if I can get along with them for a few years, but that seems like a problem on my side.

One insisted that I am autistic in the first hour and was kind of weird about it so I never went again. Another time I said because of my work I can mostly only take appointments on the afternoon, and she was like ""yeah its always a bit harder with people who work"". Then she cancelled our first session and tried to give me an appointment ealier, where I had to work. I dumped her because it made me feel like its my fault that we can't find an appointment because I have to work and it felt like she was pissed that she would always have to give me late appointments.

The thing is I really need therapy, my mentalh health is on a steady decline for a few years now, I started going to the gym and eating healthier and trying to stop smoking weed for the millionth time, but it's not enough. I want to go to therapy but the thought of spending so much money again only to find out it was all for nothing and I end up in the same point as before is keeping me from it.

I even found a therapy that is kinda specalized for the type of disorder I have but it is really expensive and my helath insurance doesn't cover it, so I would have to spend all my money on it again because I need weekly sessions.

DueAbility8751,How did you learn to deal with shame?,2,1c1ffpd,2,"I hold on to alot of shame from my past and anytime I make a decision I regret I deal with shame for a long time afterwards, sometimes years. I was bullied severely as a child, dropped out of high school because of it, got my GED, dropped out of college, got pregnant by my bf at the time. We eventually got married and had an additonal child but got divorced a year after our 2nd child was born. I have job hopped alot and quit anytime the job feels hard. I dont like to feel stupid or incompetent. I had jobs I stayed at for years but they were usually retail or restaurants,  and i always moved up quickly because i have no issue working hard if i enjoy somethibg.  
I married a great man in my mid 20s and we have been married now for 12 years. We had a child together and i stayed home with our children til our baby started kindergarten.  I have been waitressing at a local mom and pop place for the last 6 years.  I truly enjoy it but i feel stupid for being 37 and only a waitress. I dont judge anyone else that way. I have 2 coworkers older than me and i dont look at them as only a waitress or stupid. When i go out to eat, the last thing i care about is how old my server is. I just want good service. I have taken a few courses at the local community college and made As and done well. But I still dont know what I want to do, or if I would even ever leave. I make good money(averaging $18-20 hr), only work 20 hrs a week, have time to volunteer at the kids school or for my own interests and hobbies, and its an easy/low stress job. I know so many people that hatw their job, or are in debt to their eyeballs from college. Recently I got a wild hair up my butt to sign up for a dental assisting school that costs 4000. I was convinced I would feel better about myself with a ""grown up"" job. I even applied at a dental office and got the job. First class I knew i hated it. Monday rolls around and its my first day of work and I HATE it. No way i could see myself doing this forever.  I stick it out til Fri, and am crying every morning and afternoon, completely miserable. I tell my husband i cannot do this. I hate it. He seems to understand but i feel guilty for wasting 4000. I already texted my old boss and they are welcoming me back with open arms but I feel so ashamed. Shame that I hated it so bad, shame that i wasted so much money, shame that im 37 and ""just"" a server. I am so tired of feeling shame in my life. Like no matter what I do i never feel enough. Ive been in therapy for years but it doesnt seem to help any with this. 

editted to add: I care WAY too much about what others think about me. i know i do, i dont know how to stop. i put alot into how others view me, even people that arent in my circle. If this girl that i went to high school with is a nurse then i feel like crap about myself because im just a server. i dont know how to stop that either.

I‚Äôm currently in the military, and have been on deployment (yes I know I know). I just recently gotten married, and I love him. At least, I think I do. I have him in my heart, but I can also say the same thing about the other person. We haven‚Äôt got physical since I‚Äôve been married, but we met while I was coming into my new duty station. I wanted him instantly, and I got him for a ‚Äúsituation ship‚Äù for a while. 

He went on another deployment, and I went on leave to home. I re connected to my high school sweet heart, and long story short, we got married 7 months after we officially started dating. He was in another state across the map, so we were long distance. 

However, the situation ship came back, and was put on my deployment coming up. We are in the same friend group, so there was no avoiding him. I talked and we, initially, set up really good boundaries. But, after the first 3 months in, I began to get familiar in ways we used to be. I would go to him for advice and help more than my husband. I would seek validation from him instead of my husband. I would want to decline my husbands calls and be with the situation ship instead. Over time, we fell into a groove that reminded me of why I wanted him so bad. And that I used to have him, even if it was so little. 

One day we were the last two at the hangout and he admitted that he knew I had caught feelings for him- but he was too caught up in his life to fully acknowledge them. He admitted he was angry when he found out I was married, and that he should have tried more to be with me. He admitted that sometimes he thinks about starting a family with me. He says we‚Äôre so ‚Äúin sync‚Äù. I left after that bc I didn‚Äôt wanna hear more of his words.

I (m28) have been married to my wife (f31) for 5 years as of this month. Both of us came from households that had a narcissistic parent. I have a narcissistic father and she has a narcissistic mother. Over the course of our time together, we've both managed to get a lot of personal healing done :) Unfortunately, the mental scars from her mother run deep. In addition to learning everything about the hellish childhood she had to experience, we've had to actively deal with her mother reaching out via any means possible in attempts to harass her. (we've been no-contact with the mom for about a year now). My wife often struggles with feeling like she does anything right and falls into huge spirals of panic and self-doubt. I do my best to consistently offer her reassurance that her feelings are 100% valid and make it a point to never validate the awful things that her anxiety tells her. She has even said it's the only thing she feels like she hasn't been able to heal from. What can she, I, or both of us do to boost her self-confidence and start reducing the self-doubt panic spirals?",1712796100.0,
_ScoobyDoo_,Therapist brought up politics and now I'm not going back to him,2,1c13tev,8,"I started to see a therapist about a month ago for some issues I've been having, and on day 1, he brought up politics and made it clear what side of the spectrum he was on. I won't say what side because it doesn't matter what thought process he thinks and I think with regards to my post.

I kept it professional (even though I was the client) and didn't comment on it, and decided it shouldn't matter what side he was on, as he may have some great insights that I hadn't thought of, and it's good to hear from another perspective.

Well today I talked about a comment I had made to a family member that got us into an argument, and it was opposing his view point, and instead of talking about it and helping me deal with it, he decided he didn't want to talk about it because he didn't like my comment.

That seemed very unprofessional to me, and the fact that I put my feelings aside and moved on, it seemed like he should also do the same and help me process my thoughts after my argument with my family member. 

Was just curious if I'm off on my thought process here or if a professional therapist should be just that - a professional and help no matter what his feelings are on the subject matter, or if in the future I should look for someone who shares my point of view politically? ",1712802386.0,
_Infinity_Girl_,Is there some rule blocking therapists from actually helping?,15,1c0mwp8,10,"Sometimes it feels like they aren't really allowed to help. I've been trying to go to therapy for years, probably over 10 years. I've had quite a few therapists and every single one of them does the same thing. They ask me simple questions and then let me rant. Then I have to pay them. I thought going to therapy was about gaining the mental/emotional tools that you need to conquer your stress and better manage your mental illness? Is that not what it's for? I'm not paying someone hundreds of dollars a session to just let me vent. I've literally never had a good therapist and I'm starting to think there are none, either that or because I'm on Medicaid instead of actually paying them they don't want to help me or they can't help me because of some restriction. I just don't know. I've helped myself way better in the past few years then any therapist or psychologist I've ever been to.

Edit: thanks for suggestions guys! There's been a lot of hate here too but that's to be expected. It's not always true that you catch more flies with honey. Sometimes the only way I have learned something is when I pretend to be wrong or angry. Then people will come out of the woodwork from everywhere to tell me what the right answer is because everybody wants a chance to be right, over someone they think is wrong. 

That doesn't mean I lied about my experience though, and I am frustrated about it. But like one commentary pointed out, I need a specific type of therapy which was something that no one ever told me. Everyone always just told me to go to therapy and I thought there was just the one kind I guess. Not that I've been able to get a normal therapist or a psychiatrist at all, since no one has availability. But now that I have more of a focus I might be able to find something.

avacados_0303,How to get my parents to communicate with me?,1,1c134jf,1,"So I (14f) have struggled a lot in the past few years with my mental health. I started having pretty bad anger issues around 2.5 years ago and started therapy. I got diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and have been on an anti-depressant and mood stabilizer for over 2 years.  Almost 2 years ago I was hospitalized for my anger issues and especially the past year, I have learned a lot of strategies and tools to control them. I am still in therapy and I my mental heath has been pretty good but I need to work on my relationship with my parents, especially my dad. 

I feel a lot of resentment from my parents from what happened in the past few years. I have been talking to my therapist a lot about how to communicate effectively and not to get upset while doing so. I asked my dad to come to therapy with me and 5 appointments in a row he either said he didn't want to or he would cancel and he had something else to do. He finally went a few weeks ago and it went pretty well. The problem is now, and this has been happening for a while now I guess, is they do not talk to me. We will get in an argument, nothing like they used to be but we still get upset. I will recognize that we are both upset and I'll ask if we can have a conversation about this another time and they refuse to. They will say, ""If you say anything else about it again you are getting your phone taken"" or they will say we can talk about it in therapy but refuse to just have a conversation. Its like they get upset when I ask them not to do something that is a big deal (like laughing at me when I'm being serious or pretending they can't hear me). My dad will say things like ""You are the reason why we don't and will never have a good relationship,"" which really pisses me off because I am trying. We have gotten in a lot of arguments before about why I can't ask them to do something politely but they always say its because I'm the kid and they are the parent so I have to respect them but I feel that I deserve their respect too. 

So here are a couple questions I have: Should we be able to have conversations like these outside of therapy? If so, how should I go about trying to talk to them outside of therapy?

OneBaldi,"Video games me incredibly happy, but they also make me incredibly furious. ",1,1c10a48,0,"I love video games, but I can't control my anger when playing them sometimes. 

For context I'm 25, and still live with my parents. I know that most of Reddit probably would agree that im a loser, and thats fine. Think what you want. To be honest, I probably wouldnt disagree with the fact that im a loser. Im 25, living with my parents, and still throwing temper tantrums while playing video games. In reality, I probably should just end myself for how useless I am, but im trying my hardest to not do that. Most of the time, games help me relax and unwind after a long day. Most of the time they are an immense amount of joy for me, and I love them. I have no other hobbies besides gaming on my PC, and I don't want to quit. However, I can't control my anger sometimes. I've broken multiple controllers through my life, and just 6 months ago, I flipped my keyboard and it smashed into my monitor and broke it... I yell and scream when something bullshit happens. Trust me when I say, if you've ever played video games, you will know there is SO much bullshit. You die to so much random bullshit. Sometimes you die or fail at a task over and over. The constant loss is so utterly and excruciatingly painful and rage inducing. It gets to a point to where I *have* to scream at the game. My parents have recently started telling me that they hear me screaming at the game in the basement (I know, I'm a stereotypical basement dweller with severe anger problems, I hate myself too. I dont blame you for thinking im useless scum) For the longest time they've been ignoring it or haven't heard it every time. Now it's getting to a point to where I'm getting super angry too often. I try to tell myself I'm going to take breaks, but in the moment, walking away makes me more angry. I feel like I'm giving up. Like I *have* to get revenge on the game or something by getting past the difficult part, or killing the other player who killed me. So if I walk away, I generally continue to lose my shit even more because now I'm not progressing towards my goal. The thing is, I can't give up video games. It's all I have. I don't really have any friends besides one or two, and I play games with one of them. When I play games with someone else though, im able to manage my anger way better to the point to where they dont even know im angry, if I get angry at all. I have a therapist, but Lately I've been dealing with court classes because I got in some trouble a couple years back. (My anger problems outside of video games. It's a long story) So I literally don't have time to see my therapist, because I have a hefty treatment plan that I'm dealing with that takes multiple days out of the week. Hopefully soon I'll be done with the classes though, I'm nearing the end of it. What the hell do I do? I feel like I'm a lost cause.

Title. 

am autistic and I have had my fair share of difficulties with relationships. 

I am 30F, and I have always been in long-term relationships. 

Before I turned 17, I was gang raped. When I was 19, I lost both my dad and the baby I was pregnant with as he came to early and didn‚Äôt survive. 

I was in an extremely abusive relationship. This man beat me up every day, locked me up in a room with no food or water for days of if I did something to displease him, raped me whenever he felt like it. It was hell on earth. The only reason I escaped was because one day, he got bored of me, called my mother and told her that if she doesn‚Äôt come get me in 30 minutes, he would kill me. She came to get me and I never looked back. 

I was gone for a few years, but then met an ex who I was with for 4 years despite the fact that he was having affairs left, right, and center. Autistic people often have terrible gauge on who cheats on them. I think because we don‚Äôt understand the signs and are too trusting, I‚Äôm not sure, this is something my therapist struggles with understanding as well. 

I have been with my now partner for just over 2 years, engaged. We are both expats living in another country right now (which is how we met, fell in love, moved in together). We always had a lot of trust for each other and have been super open with our phones and whereabouts, we just believed it was best for us. 

He went home last Christmas for 3 weeks, and I missed him so terribly while he was gone. 

Autistic people, we struggle with separation. Especially when that person is someone who we have deemed to be safe for us, which aren‚Äôt many in the world. I slept in a pile of his clothes, and on his side of the bed so it would feel like I had a link to him. I waited day and night for him to call, and was always so happy when he did. 

Last night, a random account kept texting him on Instagram and had been for a few weeks now. He swears up and down he didn‚Äôt know who that was. 

I even helped with putting together some messages to send to that account as it was clear it was not a real user associated with the photos on that account. 

A name finally popped up and then lo and behold, she sent a photo. 

It was them in bed together. This happened whilst he was away for three weeks. The weeks I slept on his side of the bed, in a pile of his laundry so they wouldn‚Äôt lose his smell. The weeks I spent waiting by the phone for a text or call. 

My heart shattered. I am shattered. I couldn‚Äôt breathe and I sobbed for 7 hours straight. 

He has been apologizing and he swears it wasn‚Äôt more than just head, but I have been cheated on enough to know it‚Äôs never ‚Äújust head‚Äù, plus I‚Äôm old enough to be hearing stories from women of all ages. 

He has not said much to me while I sobbed because he said there is nothing he can say to make me feel better, and I am glad he is cognizant of this. 

He told me why he did this. He said it is because he didn‚Äôt get what he wanted from me sexually. Things between us have not been good sexually for a year. He is an alcoholic that becomes quite incoherent and this is scary to me. He is in AA now because I insisted on it (I have been in AA for 7 years) and I walked him to his first meeting and sat a nearby coffee shop for every day of the first weeks meeting. But because of his alcoholism, our once active and exciting sex life took a hit. To top it all off, because I am autistic, I cannot stand being touched in certain places like my legs without first mentally preparing for it. 

He is saying he will do whatever it takes to repair this. 

I just‚Ä¶.i don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶.he is amazing in every other way. I have been ill a lot and he is always there holding my hands, refilling my prescription, at the doctors office, when I have had a bad day, understanding my need to come down from a meltdown. 

I am so conflicted. I don‚Äôt know if I can ever trust him again, but I don‚Äôt know if I want to give up on us. 

I have given as much background to me and my thought process as much as I can, is there anyone here who has any thoughts on this ? Please share. 

I am currently so so numb. Should we go to therapy? Will therapy even help in this instance? 

TL;DR: I am autistic. My partner cheated on me, and he says it is because our sec life isn‚Äôt what it once was, which it isn‚Äôt because he was a raging alcoholic for a year, but with NY support, he has gotten into AA and is doing so well there. Our sex life was starting to recover, but he cheated anyway because it wasn‚Äôt fast enough for him. I can‚Äôt ask anyone what to do here because staying for leaving is my decision, but does anyone have any insights, or advice they can share with me? I‚Äôm so conflicted. Should we go to therapy?

I was just accused of manipulating my (likely soon to be ex) wife by saying that hurt and pain influences our opinions. That her opinions of me as a husband can be separate from her opinions of me as a father. Apparently I'm trying to tell her what her opinions should be.

Surprisingly she agreed to couples therapy when I pointed out that a third party could call me on any bullshit I'm spewing as much as they could do it to her. 

So. Is there a couples therapy style that calls balls and fouls? Obviously not immediately because one has to get a better sense of the dynamic.

I explained I‚Äôve worked there years never heard any issue I don‚Äôt know what they mean by cookies or other snacks etc and if there‚Äôs pastries out in the lounge for everyone which they do provide weekly I‚Äôve grabbed one or two over the years‚Ä¶  we were under the impression it‚Äôs for everyone and welcome. They provide a fridge of drinks daily for all staff and even volunteers and pto etc (who pay for this I was told but could be wrong). Now I did admit I took like 3 drinks the other day at the end of the day to bring with me (mostly to have for the work week), one water. I am willing to pay to replace these or simply never take drinks out of the building or more than one again when working? 
The guy said he will talk to them see if it can be lifted off because obviously I‚Äôm family to the campus and volunteer and do a lot no issues or write ups and doesn‚Äôt want things awkward also that I‚Äôm requested often to work there prior to this. Also that I have the highly qualified teaching degree etc. 

I‚Äôm heartbroken and embarrassed. I can‚Äôt even show my face again really or even speak to anyone about this. 
This morning the principal chatted thanked me for setting stuff up for the school all the time. 
Do you have any advice? 
I don‚Äôt know if someone saw me or it was on camera or exaggerated or what.

I can‚Äôt tell my family or everyone I‚Äôve let down.

Mammoth_Storm_8090,Help do should I get therapy? ,1,1c0ueoe,0,"Throwaway account. 

A month ago my wife and I had a very solid talk about our feelings. And it came out that during some work seminars about sexuality and such that she realises that she might now be asexual (we haven't had sex in 5 years, married for 15). It was a really good convo. She aired her fears and so did I. We both left it feeling good about our relationship. The following week I felt better. This ball of anger was gone.... But then I started dreaming, dreaming of her having sex with others, of me constantly finding anything to have sex with, toys, items looking vaginal anything (not other people though). Realizing that I've stopped hitting on her and flirting and trying to be sexual with her, holding her hand feels like a memory of holding her hand. Like I'm losing my emotional connection to her now that I'm coming to accept that sex might never happen again. Even when angry there was hope of being intimate, everything physical and flirty feels empty and pointless now. 

And my mind is now begining to feel frayed, I'm trying to reconcile what she has said with what I am. I am sexual. How can thta work? How can a couple when one is sexual and the other no longer sexual survive? I'm trying to stay grounded. Recognize what's real. I love my wife. I know this. But a connection feels severed now. An important one. 

I've suffered from depression most of my adult life (it's being managed through various means and 80% it feels just like I'm tired, 10% just waking up feels impossible, 5% I just can't go on, and the other 5% is usually very clear days), and that usually feels like clearing snow from my front walk. It's always snowing some days there is a mountain, others a light dusting. But I'm always able to clear it, even if quite slow sometimes. This feeling I understand. The snow can be moved, it can be piled and cleared. 

But the snow now feels like... Spaghetti.... It's loose and wriggly and I can't clear it. I shovel and shovel and shovel and it just slides right back. And the more I shovel it the more I notice that my shovel is turning to spaghetti. And so are my hands, and my feet. I'm starting to circle thoughts over and over and over. 

What is happening to me? Help. 

P. S. I know it's a bit rambly I'm sorry. It's as coherent as I can make it. I've tried to include what I think is important and what I think the cause is for my state of mind. ",1712777873.0,

ConclusionBig5187,ONE LAST POST AND ADVICE TO EVERYONE HERE,4,1c0kg3c,4,"I have been active here for quite a few weeks and have shared my story where I went through therapy abuse, my Therapist took advantage of my own vulnerabilities, she first crossed boundaries by telling about her private life, how her husband abused her, and cried in front of me, I was someone who cared for her, obviously because she was my T, I helped her go through this phase, sent her pancakes whenever she was upset, she asked for hugs and forehead kisses, which I didn't prefer but I was so attached to her ( because I never had someone in my life to hear about my struggles, I was emotionally and physically abused growing up by my parents and was bullied in school too, so I had trouble standing up for myself ) but yea, continuing the story, she used to message me whenever she was in trouble, but then started taking advantage of me once my therapy was over,

ghosted me whenever I came up with issues or messaged, didn't pick up calls and never returned my money( which I gave her bcz apparently she had an issue with her payment), now later through texts, I get to know that she had cheated on her  husband once, now I started to see the redflags, still I believed that she is okay, but here comes the trouble, i used to so not like it, cuz i hated her red flags but again i was emotionally attached, plus the intimate moments, cuz i have never been so intimate with someone. 

But yea, i posted on few subreddits about what happened and they told me to report her, which i didn't cuz i didn't want any revenge but few weeks later, wrote a big paragraph about whatever the issues were, guess what she blamed me for all of it, how i was the one who caused these troubles and then brought out some of my past traumas saying that i am the one who is wrong and should be ashamed. I realized that each of the believes i had for her, her red flags, narcissistic behaviour was completely true. I ended up the conversation with her and blocked her.  
The reason I am writing this post is because I thought of myself as a person who cared, someone who put efforts, and now with was returned to me, i see the carefree guy inside me just vanish.

 I want you guys to never ever make this mistake, Please, you guys do experience attachment to your T alot and value your therapists, its a good thing, I used to feel good too after the sessions that were professional. But just because a therapist is good to you, its because he/she is good at his/her job, not because he/she is a good person. NEVER CROSS THE BOUNDARIES, work on your mental health.

I wish nothing but the best for you all. Whatever happened with me, its fine, World is cruel, and god has its own ways. I am happy that this is over finally, No more stressing over someone, and at least i learnt to stand up for myself and value my self worth. I just hope the love I had for her, comes back to me in someway or other in future, But that's about it, I will delete this reddit account, and start a new life, less toxic and good for mental health. Happy to share this journey with all of you.

Much love, hugs

myaltbitch,My friend needs help and I don't know what to do,1,1c0bdvy,0,"I have a friend who's going through a really hard time right now. His dad passed away earlier this year, he's physically disabled, his mom is in pretty bad health and he has a younger brother he's almost completely responsible for. On top of all that he comes from a really poor family and is only able to go to college thanks to a full ride scholarship he stresses about being able to maintain the grades for.

He's been posting long vents about the state of his life, but backs off and insists he's fine whenever my friends and I express concern. He refuses any kind of help unless absolutely necessary and even then will only ask for very minimal things. He's also always been kind of a workaholic but it's gotten worse, anytime he's doing something that's not ""productive"" he laments the fact he's wasting time and needs to get back to whatever it is that needs doing. He hasn't burnt out yet but with the way he's burning the candle at both ends I'm afraid he'll hit a breaking point.

I'm not worried about him trying to off himself, I think he feels too much responsibility for his family, but I am worried he'll end up working himself to death. I know him well enough to know he won't accept therapy or counseling unless it's forced upon him and with how much he does around the house and the physical health of his other family members I'm worried something bad might happen if he's gone for an inpatient stay of any kind. 

He recently left our group chat and we haven't had correspondence for a few days. This isn't an uncommon thing for him to do when he needs to focus on exams or something, but with circumstances the way they are right now I'm really worried about him. 

I have no idea what to do, how can I make him get help? Do I even have the right to make him get help? Should I stage an intervention? I'm completely stuck but I can't watch him do this to himself anymore.

What do I do?",1712718423.0,
EfficientSquirrel832,Sexual addiction or dysphoria?,10,1bzshe0,7,"Below is a post I‚Äôve made in the past, but am looking for more professional advice. For the record: I am actively seeking an appointment with a qualified therapist, but am just curious what folks on this medium have to say. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I apologize for the throwaway account. I am trying to maintain anonymity while I figure this out. 

So I have dealt with a healthy amount of ‚Äúdysphoria‚Äù (I only use quotes because I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what it is) for as long as I can remember. At least starting as young as 8. I remember laying in bed wishing I would wake up a girl. I don‚Äôt even know where it came from, I hadn‚Äôt used the internet, or had influences that would stimulate that thought‚Ä¶ I could be misremembering. But I remember saying to a friend in elementary school that I think it‚Äôd be better to be a girl, again, probably minimal stimulus to affect those feelings (I never dressed up or acted feminine). When I was a preteen I found online pornography and other subsequent activities. I later found niche porn regarding gender swaps and the like that became my go to for years. It‚Äôs still a ‚Äústruggle‚Äù for me 15+ years later. I go months without indulging it, but end up viewing for several days, find resolve to quit and last a couple more weeks-months. 

Some of the other indications I experience are regarding sexual activities with my wife. I cannot reach an orgasm, or even become aroused without picturing myself as a woman. I often close my eyes and try to act as though her long hair is mine, her breasts pushing against my chest are mine.. the sheets brushing against me as women‚Äôs clothing, etc. Sometimes my wife calls me sexy, which I encourage, and I find it arousing because it‚Äôs a very feminine term to me. I will often wear her clothes (which I find very sexually exciting) when she‚Äôs not home and have been nearly caught a few times by her and by family when I was younger. Still, nobody knows. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about this or what it means‚Ä¶ whether it‚Äôs a sexual issue or one of gender dysphoria‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really know where to go with it. To me it feels like a curse, because culturally, it‚Äôs an impossible choice. My wife and family could have a small chance of acceptance, but I know how the reaction would be. I can‚Äôt imagine the things that would be said about me to my face and behind my back. I literally don‚Äôt know how I would deal with it. I often wish I could run away and cut off all ties, then transition in secret and restart as a woman, not letting anyone know about my past. I love my wife far too much to do that.  

I carry immense guilt because of this and my LDS church upbringing (I served a mission, hold callings, etc), generally I stay involved in the church because my wife believes, and familial and social pressures. I recently have been going to pornography-adapted 12 step meetings about this, and may continue to do so, though I struggle to see the point sometimes.

Overall it has not impacted my life except for internally. I get depressed and anxious, independent of the dysphoric feelings, but the dysphoria worsens it a ton. I‚Äôd say I am happy or content about half the time. There are aspects of manhood that I strive for and am excited/challenged by, but I can‚Äôt get passed these weird feelings I have. I will often wish I could be a beautiful woman I see on the street. ‚ÄúHow much better would life be if I was her?‚Äù A question I ask myself much less frequently about men I see. My life so far is good, but it can be depressing and I hate myself for the feelings I get, but I‚Äôve managed into my late 20s. I‚Äôve kept it secret to this point, what‚Äôs another 60 or so years (I say while inwardly doubting) I don‚Äôt want to have these feelings forever, but what choice is there? Does this sound like genuine gender dysphoria? If I did transition, what if I regret it years later and detransition? This coming from a guy who‚Äôs afraid to get a tattoo because of the seeming finality of it(I‚Äôm going to do it at some point for sure).

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
I hope I made this coherent, it‚Äôs probably pretty scattered. I look forward to parsing through this with a therapist, but can‚Äôt get my mind off of it in the meantime. ",1712670098.0,
keyiwantskele,i‚Äôm going to apologize to the kid i‚Äôve bullied. is this how i should‚Äôve approached him?,2,1c04eo7,2,"Back story (the post i made 2 days ago): I‚Äôve always teased this guy in my class and force him to give me homework answers or help me cheat a test. He‚Äôs a quiet kid but really nice. No matter how mean I was to him, he‚Äôd always smile and help me out and speak nicely towards me and everyone else. He was just easy to pick on. I have anger issues and so I easily get mad, and im just realizing i only take my anger out on him. I even remember this one time in third grade, he was ‚Äúannoying‚Äù me so I started to yell at him but all he did was hug me, which made me even more mad because I didn‚Äôt want to be seen as ‚Äúweak‚Äù. He doesn‚Äôt even act scared around me. Like when I tell him to give me anlassers to homework, he would just do it casually without any visible fear. One time, I was hugging my stomach because of period cramps and he noticed. Later that day, there was a tiny stain on my pants and he offered me his sweater. Being the idiot I am, I yelled at him and ran to the nurse. I feel so messed and I feel like a jerk. I feel so guilty but I dont know how to approach him or apologize. Please help me. What do I say? How do I approach him? What do I do if he doesn‚Äôt forgive me?

Update: I really want to apologize to the guy (we‚Äôll call him x). After I posted the backstory separately, I added him on snapchat, went to school, and then I completely ignored him at school. When i came home from school that day, I saw that x added me back. The next day at school (yesterday), i ignored him again. Today, i started to message him on snap so i can apologize. So, here‚Äôs what the conversation looked like:

 Me: ‚Äúx‚Äù ‚ÄúI jst wanna ask if you can meet me under the bleachers tomorrow at track(track & field) during warm ups?? i wanna tell you something there and id rather do it in person so‚Äù
X: ‚ÄúYeah it‚Äôs alr‚Äù

Did i approach him the right way? I know i was being shtty to him and you guys probably think im trying to become the victim here after that post, but it‚Äôs really not that. i really do want to apologize and im gonna start to leave him alone if things turn out badly.

For a little over a year now, I've lost the spark to do my job and it's getting worse. I've started not to care what happens whether I get promoted or not. I can barely focus at work. I look at my tasks and it just feels like a huge overwhelming thing. I've started looking for other stimuli while at work. Nothing is interesting here anymore. I love my job though, I don't understand why I'm having a hard time doing it. Why can't I focus. I am supposed to be in-charge of an entire project now but I'm thinking of asking my supervisor to transfer me back to my old team because I have nothing, no energy to do this anymore. I was chasing the spark that's why I agreed to do this but now, it's all gone. I had plans for this project and now I can't see them. Everything is muddled up, I'm not sure if I can see anything now. 

It was bad before. It's horrible now because I lost my puppy. I've only had this puppy for approximately 21 days but I was incredibly attached to them and their sibling puppy that came with them. I tried to save the puppy and spent so much money trying to save them but they still died last April 4. After that, I was just coursing through life, barely there. I am behind of many tasks and I want to do them but at the same time I'm not sure why I can't do them. 

It doesn't help that my mum and dad keep arguing about the construction around the house. Mum keeps mentioning that I shouldn't have spent so much on a dying dog like it doesn't hurt to be reminded of it.

Everything feels like a monumental task and I can't do this. I don't want to do this. I want to do this but I can't. It's like there's a lead on my hands as I do my work and there's lead here too as I type this. I don't quite understand why I wanted to save that puppy so much. I don't understand why I can't work properly. I don't understand why I can't focus. 

I just want everything to stop. I've never been so attached to a dog before, it's been days but being reminded of my dead puppy makes me incredibly sad enough to move me to tears. 

Today, I was going through my photos and I know it was random but google photos sorted my videos one where my dead puppy was alive and playing around and the other of them dying with an IV attached near their paw. It's so messed up I ended up crying all about it again. Nothing is the same ever again.

So I took a gap year after school in hopes I will get into a good uni, but I fucked up the exams and now it‚Äôs just looking bad.

I never tried to do that again, I don't really discuss this my friends because who would want someone‚Äôs emotional baggage when they have things going on in their own life, right? 

Maybe from last year, I got this strong urge to hit my parents, ofc I will not act upon it if I want to live lol. I sometimes even think about how nice it would be if I didn't have any parents but that's just ungrateful and selfish thinking.

I know my parents are only human and i should forgive them, but this has been happening again and again and I don‚Äôt think I have much forgiveness left in me.

This has also somehow impacted my academics too, I have been in a slump for a long time. I just can‚Äôt study anymore, and it has been impacting my results which make my family mad. 
So if anyone can help me get out of this slump and give me some advice, I would really appreciate it.

bixquick33,Is this normal in Therapy,1,1bzxbsa,0,"Wall of Text, Sorry.

I haven't been in therapy for the last year, but had a great relationship with my therapist for 3 years prior. For the past 6 years I have wanted to move from my hometown across the country just to explore the world. I have a wife and kids. My wife does not want to move because we don't know anyone, she thinks I have idealized a place to live and it will fail to meet my expectations, and believes I have come up with in my mind some sort magical pill of moving will fix my depression. All she keeps telling me to do is to go back to therapy. I really don't want to. I just want to know if you y'all think I am irrational about it.

My first two years in therapy were great- we went through alot of my childhood trauma. I was diagnosed with ADHD. He helped me in finding my footing as a person, I grew to be more confident and self assured. However I could not shake my depression and the one thing that always kept bringing me down was I hate the city I grew up in and still live in. My wife and I had moved away for 2 years and I never wanted to go back. We did because we had a suprise pregnancy and she wanted to be near her family. 

My therapist went through the whole let's find things you love about where you live, the list is short. Alright things you hate, the list is long. What are your favorite activities how can you do them more. Essentially how can we make you like where you live. The more I pursued my favorite activities the more depressed I got, because they weren't available 90% of the time. By the end my therapist while working through was like you just need to make peace with living here or you just need to move. 

I eventually stopped seeing my therapist because I didn't know what else to talk about. Anything that mildly annoyed me became a big issue in sessions because I didn't really have anything else to work through and that was one thing I could think of. Like stupid stuff like how my coworker was loud with their stapler one time or my kid spilled applesauce on my pants. 

Now I got a job opportunity to move to city I have want to move to for 6 years and my wife thinks it is a terrible idea and wants me to go back to therapy and work through why I can't be happy where I currently live because she believes I will eventually become as equally as depressed as where I am now. 

Am I being irrational about our move? Is therapy really going to help me change my perspective? I honestly feel like if I don't move that I need to give up all my dreams, desires, or wants because they literally aren't coming true. Like I have to become something else to be happy where I am because currently who I am will not be happy here.",1712682303.0,

untalentedplant,Can't let go from a break up/ex,1,1bzwl2x,1,"i was in a relationship with this guy for 2 years but we broke up almost a year now, however even though i try to maintain no contact with him, it kept breaking. early months before he would also reach out but not as frequent as i do, but i did try the best of me to maintain the no contact.

the month october, he was set on letting me go because he's aware that he can no longer commit to me and still unsure whether he wants me gone for good or not. i found closure to that and i managed to not reach out to him for two weeks nor the desire. but about the mark of 3rd week no contact, he messaged me and conversations happened, i expected it to last only for that day but he was texting me first for days. i got an overwhelming feeling why he does that since he's still unsure whether he wants to commit or not but he did say that he missed me and would want to try again.

we kind of started being together again, but secretly from our friends since they knew we broke up and don't have a good image both sides(?). although, i think we were kind of trying better for each other and the relationship we were trying to build again.

however, during that time, we had a big fight about his friend that is a girl, they were going to gym together alongside with a mutual friend, but sometimes it would be uncomfortable to me because of the lack of boundaries he has with the girl and vice versa. i tried not to get it the best out of me since he paid for that membership before talking to me and we weren't really public with each other's friends that were together again, i tried to be so understanding with our situation and i'm aware of how bad it is, but this was our last fight that we had as a couple.

looking back at it, i was and maybe still insecure about that incident, he's still hanging out with the girl but one of our mutual friend says he doesn't like her nor the girl likes him. they both just don't have boundaries although i'm not saying girls and guys can't be friends, but i think it's kind of disrespectful how they act with each other while im still in the picture/still hurting for the loss of the relationship.

this happenings made me so disorganized and dysregulated that sometimes i still contact him again, although i already done one month no contact with him but i think im struggling to let go or finding it hard to accept that he was really done with me after having that fight with his female friend. i hate him and i sometimes miss him, i question myself often if i accepted that the relationship is over, yes i do, but i don't know why i still reach out to him and talk, i know a closure isn't necessary and i do try to prioritize my well-being, i do help myself, asked for a help in my school's counselor but their therapy style didn't work for me, it made me more anxious.  i think im a person who relapses, i don't know what else im gonna do, im worried that i'll never get over this.",1712680436.0,

I have noticed that many of us, myself included, have tried to go to therapy or may have been interested in doing so at some point in our lives

It has mostly become something of a last resort when everything seems hopeless and you feel absolutely down in the drain. 

The reasons usually are the stigma or the sky high rates or plain and simple procrastination.

plukhkuk,Addiction or a coping mechanism?,2,1bzol27,0,"I am in the process of getting therapy - theres a bit of a waiting list where I come from for the free services and I can't afford to pay for private. However, I have a question that's been bothering me for weeks now and I wonder if anyone here could shed some light.

I always enjoyed reading books - fiction and non fiction alike. With life being busy as is in the last few years I didn't really read as much as I'd like... maybe a couple of books a month.

However, in the last 6 months something changed... I read multiple novels every week. I read ALL THE TIME when I'm not working or doing chores but also when I should be working or doing chores. I stay late at night and read. I wake up and before I even get my coffee I read. I read while I do other things if possible. I have a e-reader and I hold it/have it with me almost all the time. Its just whatever the story I'm reading is just so much better than anything else I could be doing in real life. Better than working, cleaning the house, spending time with my family.

I have some issues and I've always been an avoidant type of person, usually running away from my problems, putting a 'physical' distance if possible. But I feel like some things/situations can't be avoided in that way and so I think reading and getting lost in the story is how I'm pitting the distance between me and the real world.

I think it's just a coping mechanism but in the lat few days I started to think that maybe there's an element of addiction to it?

We fought on my passive aggression, stonewalling and many miscommunication things.

At the end of it all she reached out after NC for many weeks and I flipped out. It revealed my responses to things like this that even happened in a new relationship 

Therapist said this was ‚Äútrauma‚Äù. My reactions after being done in that relationship are being overdramatic, distrusting, and overthinking. I sounded like a crazy person but more importantly I‚Äôm playing games. My intentions mean for something, but my actions sound like the opposite. it‚Äôs overdramatically done, attention seeking, when i get close to what I want I shut it down and verbally say I want the other thing when deep down I do want that.

Recently I have been having severe nightmares and night terrors.
I have surreal dreams that I sometimes can‚Äôt distinguish from reality. 

I‚Äôll wake up in my room, exactly like how I left it and will hear demonic whispers and sometimes screams. I will be frozen in fear and unable to breathe, thinking that it‚Äôs real. I‚Äôve been prone to sleep apnea and sleep paralysis since childhood so they dreams are very real.
I‚Äôll then wake up, still unable to breathe but able to move. I get so freaked out by these dreams I shake and have to breathe for a moment.

Other dreams will be people I know in my life yelling and telling me I‚Äôm an evil being and that I have to leave and chase me away or taunt me.

Other times I‚Äôm still in my room and there‚Äôs something terrorizing me. Either yanking my blankets off, hissing in my ear, or crawling on top of me and stabbing me on my sides.
I never see what the creature is and only know it‚Äôs a dream when I wake up and see that my sheets are not placed like they were in the dream. I usually sleep still so they usually stay on top of me. 

What is this? I feel like I‚Äôm going insane. I feel like I‚Äôm going to turn into my aunt. I‚Äôm so scared.

anyway- i go into the session and start explaining about the breakup. there were some things that he said that i felt were really.. accurate i guess, like saying how he thought i had some codependency issues/issues with self worth etc but then he started (unprompted) talking about God and how i would make a good wife? 

i honestly remember thinking that it felt really sexist because he kept saying things like ‚Äúit‚Äôs a man‚Äôs nature to be less connected‚Äù and saying how things my ex did and how he was distant was ‚Äúman‚Äôs nature.‚Äù and then he kind of continued and went on to tell me that i‚Äôm exactly what a man wants in a wife and that i‚Äôm the perfect like tender, submissive wife (he actually said this) but that men, my ex specifically, don‚Äôt realize what they have because they aren‚Äôt ready for that kind of emotional connection. these ‚Äúwife‚Äù comments went on through the entire session.

then he started talking about God and how i need to have ‚Äúprophetic edge‚Äù ?? and quoted two bible verses to me about how i shouldn‚Äôt seek out love and how i should ‚Äústumble upon‚Äù it. he told me that when i‚Äôm actively looking for a partner they can sense like my weakness and sense that desperation for connection and take advantage of it.

that‚Äôs just some of it but the more i think about it the more it honestly bothers me because it wasn‚Äôt what i expected. he did say some things that i felt were insightful but idk. he also repeatedly made comments about how he wished i was dating his 25 year old son and even said at one point he wished he was my dad. i just feel really weird. is this normal?",1712612753.0,

Tluon,Should I do therapy?,1,1bzg4oh,2,"Hi Everyone. I am a 25M, unsure whether I should get therapy. My life, overall, has been complex. I didn't live in a happy family growing up. My dad never loved my mom. I sometimes still remember the vague memories of being hit and not being able to walk for a weekend for simply leaving the TV on in one of the rooms. My dad never wanted kids and always made it clear he didn't want me and my sister to be born. Over the years, I managed to get past this trauma by meeting new people and making new friends. I find comfort and support in others, especially around positive experiences. The more positive experiences I had, the more confidence I gained. Essentially, I am the ""flag-bearer""/""motivator"" person in my group of friends and cohort (back in college). I even took the courageous step of being my class commencement speaker, which I never imagined myself doing. However, after I left college, I experienced a lot of harassment (both verbal and physical) at work from some of my former bosses. It traumatized me as a growing scientist.

I fell into a hole and felt utterly isolated and lonely. I remember from one of my former workplaces that I broke down and cried during lunchtime before quitting the following day. Thankfully, I have a lot of friends from my past and workplace to support me in my life and help me move on. Since then, I have been doing well in networking and talking to others professionally. I have also supported some of my friends through their careers and personal lives (finding new jobs or dealing with loss). Seeing my friends happy made me happy. However, privately, I accepted that I was bound to a life of suffering. My experience with my family and work made me think I deserved to suffer. I am never going to be happy. For me, happiness means self-sacrifice. As long as I see others I care about are happy, even if I suffer, I am happy. Utilitarianism is everything to me. I don't love or care about myself.

There are other things that I don't feel comfortable talking about in this post, which leads me to my current belief. But it's a lot for me to process right now. I have also thought of dating for the first time, but I don't think I will mentally be ready for one, nor will I ever be in one. I already accepted it like that. I am still unsure where my final career path will be, but I was considering politics/government or pharmaceuticals.

Intrepid_Eggplant_10,what do i say to a potential therapist?,1,1bz3j5j,2,"I‚Äôve been trying to convince myself to reach out to a therapist for months. I think I‚Äôm maybe, possibly, at the point where I can get myself to do it. I know I need to, but I‚Äôm just scared of being judged and feel (am) undeserving. But at this point therapy is a last attempt to fix myself before, well, you know. The doctor that prescribes my antidepressants and my family both think I should be in therapy, fwiw. 

I‚Äôve been in therapy before (which never really worked), but I‚Äôve never had to reach out by myself because I was either a child or assigned to someone short-term by the college clinic. I don‚Äôt know what to say, in an email or a first conversation or whatever. It‚Äôs absolutely terrifying to think of what they might think of me if I say the wrong thing and embarrass myself. I‚Äôm somewhat aware this isn‚Äôt a healthy mindset.

I‚Äôm diagnosed with GAD and depression and a couple related issues, but I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs something deeper wrong with me. I think I have avoidant PD or something similar. But I‚Äôm not traumatized. I don‚Äôt even know what kind of therapist could help me; the DBT, CBT, etc. therapists I‚Äôve seen in the past have been fairly useless, and I‚Äôm prone to hiding the full truth from people anyway. I feel too guilty to seek out anyone who claims to specialize in trauma, because I don‚Äôt have that and someone else definitely needs their help more than I do, but therapists who just do depression/anxiety have just made me feel worse. 

I‚Äôm sorry that this ended up being more of a vent than I intended, but what I‚Äôm really asking for is basically an email template that makes me sound reasonably normal while also indicating why I‚Äôm reaching out and *not* making me sound pathetic and like a privileged brat inventing their problems (which I probably am, but I don‚Äôt want to come off that way).

Till now I can‚Äôt find what it was or what it must be called but my story with a man was really different and I can‚Äôt get over it until now so please help me So let‚Äôs start : I am 21 student and at the beginning of the last September I was accepted as a part of student research committee of our college and the supervisor of the committee who is fifth stage medical student messaged me about my experience and We met many times with the group he really loved me cuz I truly worked hard and he put three of us as organizers of the committee me and another girl who truly love research and she is really beautiful with a boy. The supervisor has a very very high IQ and like there‚Äôs nothing he doesn‚Äôt know , he is like an idealistic scientist really smart really good at everything and too stoic at the same time , handsome and really good at psychology and everything .¬†

  


¬†So one night we started to chat like he become too close we were talking and talking with non stopping I don‚Äôt have any idea how it started but imagine for the first time we chatted for about 17 hours just normal chats about life , friendship , finding out each other with time passed he started telling me the naughty things that he has done for example sleeping with a woman who was 10 years bigger than him while he was only 14 and he told me that he is working for Central Intelligence Agency of the country and he is doing very scary works as he is really good at programming hacking and IT stuffs and here he make me trust him with days passed it changed to phone calls calling me for 15 hours only talking talking talking like we haven‚Äôt leave anything to say but we still have much things to say ,

  


¬†he first told me about his true love as he has a gf and he promised her that or she or no one else and I told him the secret of my life which is I have a bf who is not from my country and he is a doctor and it has been three years we are together but that time we broke up we fought t to be more specific ) and I started crying but he acted as he was providing a really safe space for me as I can say anything with no judgment and he was really good at human behaviour and day by day he opened me up about more harder thoughts he truly knew everything about me the trauma that I saw in my childhood , the assault that happened and much much things in a way no one knows things about me as him , and once he called me and said I love you and I want to be with you , ok I am no denying but my heart was beating fast oh my god the way he tried to become close to me the way he made me feel special, but how can we be together while he has smn else ?

  


¬†He changed while his words he said we won‚Äôt be together 99% we can‚Äôt reach together as his lover is really religious and he doesn‚Äôt believe in religion and btw he started putting nihilism in my mind as ruining all religious principles and mind washing truly he was giving me euphuism of love in a very magical way and Sexual part started as he become close to me ans more open he wanted to sleep with me‚Äùin my community it‚Äôs a taboo‚Äù

  


¬†and he started convincing me but I didn‚Äôt have any sexual tension toward him like I wanted him to be my friend but not sex but like he convinced me in a way he said lemme sleep with you once and then will marry you and started convincing convincing until I agreed cuz I loved him blindly and unconditionally many nights he were making sexual stories about us many imaginations that truly falling me as it‚Äôs true he was reaching orgasm but I wasn‚Äôt but last night I fell and it‚Äôs my first time like I felt a sexual tension toward him and I wish I didn‚Äôt after that he said it was only whole School of Pyscotherapy and that time I died and it was like a knife on my heart for the second time I gave a man another chance and it was only a lie a therapy for what to learn what ?¬†

  


God why do I deserve this ? It was only three weeks but I was addicted to him in a way I has been six months about that he said it was a therapy but even a day didn‚Äôt pass without honking about him he fell me and left me every night I am crying suffering like he was saying I am reactive but he did everything please someone tell me what to do ?After that he changed whole of his words as he is very good at gaslighting once I fought and told him a narcissist he said U r nothing more than a dumb and Hulu are not qualified enough and even he puts me away from the committee which was my dream to learn and grow and he started doing the same thing with another girl these days while I am suffering so please any help any suggestion I am trying to write part two but till now tell me describe both of us.

Summary of my crisis below, if you want to skip that part you can scroll to the ‚û°Ô∏è to get to the jizt of my post. 

In short, mine and my partners relationship is on the line.  My partner wants a child at some point in life, I am leaning on a no. For me at least currently there are more risks than rewards.
We both love each other dearly and don't really see a life without us. 

This is putting a strain on us, especially myself. I've never felt this bad, never had these bodily symptoms of depression etc. 

This crisis has also triggered several more, I'm having a huge crisis with my general life. 

I'm 30, I hate my job and never seem to find a workplace I like and that doesn't eventually end my employment due to the company wanting to save money. 
I don't have any life goals and no real direction. 

I've pretty much lived on autopilot the last years. 

What I thought was my passion, traveling might just be a coping mechanism I have used to escape my everyday life and job. 


‚û°Ô∏è Okey, recap done. 

So I am feeling desperate, I feel like I need guidence and help to sort my feelings out. What do I really want in life? How do I become happy and content? 

These 30min sessions I get once a week feels just not enough for me, so I'm looking at other options and figured that getting away from my everyday struggles and to focus whole heartedly on myself for a few days could be helpful. This would also give me the experience of traveling without my partner and that in it's own could be insightful. 

Does anyone know about any therapy retreats or similar that could help me? 

I'm basically looking to be guided through my thoughts and feelings for a couple of days as I am having a hard time doing it on my own without a meltdown

I'm feeling quite lost at the moment, I have a job that I don't like and feel like its a dead end as I unfortunately am not really qualified to go into anything else or have the passion to join another job.

I don't have many friends and have lost quite a few of them because of me being way to dedicated to my job and never going out after highschool. I tried communicating with new people from my highschool but that also didn't go well as I didn't have many interests to be friends with them.

I really wish I took a gap year to think about what I wanted to do with my career after highschool but feel like thats too late.

Recently, I've had to undertake surgery that required me to have a month fully off work. And it made me really think how lonely I have been (and how much I hated my job...) 

I was actually quite happy during that time off and sad at the same time. 

Recently since my return (working from home) my new boss has been micromanaging me and believes I no longer do enough in my current role. However I feel the same as I feel like I can't keep up with the demand anymore. It's way too much and its impacting my mental health. 

I am really tempting to quit as I feel like I can't do this job anymore. But I'm not sure what to do after...  Keep in mind I am studying as well at the moment but a course I want to do.

Should I toss my job in before I get fired and travel, or should I continue working with my job until I get fired? I am 20 years old.

I no longer feel that I‚Äôm in a safe space and I‚Äôm not sure if I should search for a new therapist at this time. The situation was that I went out to dinner after I put my kids to bed and when I retuned I found out my mom had a few glasses of wine - I was incredibly upset at the situation - but the kids were asleep and we were out for 2 hours max (this was the first threat after I shared this with him because I was worried my mother would relapse into drinking). The second instance I had to leave my house for an hour and when I came back my mother had started drinking while alone with the kids (relapsed for real this time - but it was the first time that ever happened while with my kids). The therapist threatened CPS again before I even finished my story that I am in the process of hiring a nanny because I now understand she has a real problem and this behavior is unacceptable. So not only am I mourning the relationship and the betrayal of my mother right now, but I also feel betrayal by the therapist. I have a lot of wounding around growing up in an alcoholic home and the thought of someone thinking I would do the same thing to my kids is extremely hurtful. I myself don‚Äôt drink just FYI. Would you switch therapists? 

Edited to add: Just want to remind people that people are in this group either because they are therapists or looking to get better. Although some things that were said here were hurtful - I am strong enough to be able to handle it - that might not be the case with other people in this group. Just be careful because you do not know how fragile someone‚Äôs mental health is who might post in this type of group.

obsession? attachment? clinginess? hyperfixation? idk what to call it but something like those, anyway i'll get to the point. there's this person who's one year older than me i have an obsession on. i'm really clingy to her because i sort of see her as an older sister and she helped me get through one of the lowest points of my life, but this obsession's been going on for i think around 6 or 7 months? 

it got really bad that it got to a point where i just became really creepy, for example if i know she's somewhere in school, example the canteen, i would purposely go there just to see her, like i'm not gonna talk to her or anything i just wanna see her IT'S SO CREEPY and were not that close that were like BEST friends but we talk a lot so there's that. 

i also tend to overthink everything she does and it's like my entire world revolves around her just cuz i became really clingy to her and stuff, and for example everytime i'd spend time with her in school (cuz we mostly just talk through text rarely in person) i would replay those moments and i could clearly remember everything that happened and it's so weird idk why i do that

of course i also try my best to give her space and respect her boundaries too, but sometimes i just forget that and i really really hate that i'm clingy to her because at this point its kinda ruining our friendship and it's ruining myself too. 

i get panic attacks frequently and most of the time, the trigger is usually because of overthinking something that she said/did. deep down i know that there's some logical reason behind what i'm overthinking and i'm just being irrational, but my thoughts keep making me focus on the negatives. even if theres a less than 1% chance the negative thing will happen, it's what my mind is 100% sure will happen because theres still that tiny chance it will

i know that it's really bad, getting a lot of panic attacks over a person isn't healthy but i don't know how to seek help and where to start, or even if i could afford it. can i receive some advice from some of you guys if possible? advice on my situtation or advice in seeking help, any of it. any advice is really appreciated, thanks!

Where did it all go wrong?
Lacking in self love 
Filled with hatred of myself
Will I ever recover?

Nobody has ever been as happy as I once was. The pain I‚Äôve felt for 7 years has ruined my perspective. I am no longer happy, the love I give others still isn‚Äôt enough, for I lost love in myself. I‚Äôve been beaten, raped by people I called family, abandoned by ones who loved me. I was so alone, I was so unhappy for years. I tried to cover it up with outside love, but they left too. For my love wasn‚Äôt enough, and my mind was too much. Yes of course I still had the love of my family, lucky enough, but it wasn‚Äôt good enough. Something about loving me after once being abandoned by them made me angry, uncomfortable. I let it fester and build, dragging me further everyday. Then one day I finally broke, took everything out on the people I loved the most, over and over, day after day. When they left was the day I realized I no longer loved myself. I spent 7 years believing I did, but it was all covered, it wasn‚Äôt real. 

Today marks the first day of truly loving myself. I have to say, it‚Äôs amazing. I have never had so much happiness, I feel unstoppable, energized. I feel like a kid again, I‚Äôve been given another chance at life. Today is the day I started living, and I stopped looking in the past. I hope to share this to people who need to hear it. The pain I felt for 7 years HAD ruined my perspective.

They‚Äôd just left a relationship after a year long separation and started increasing the level of intimacy in our chats. Telling me secrets about themselves sending me screenshots of men on bumble that shared my name, saying they keep getting reminded of me in other people. I‚Äôm m 26 and single and felt really confident in myself at the time and so I asked them out, and was politely declined. 

I then said something to the effect of ‚Äúthis is still an important friendship to me, I‚Äôd like to maintain it if possible.‚Äù And got told off in a very harsh way. Demanding I explain my rationale, saying I was dumb and reading too much into things, that I moved on too soon after her break up and must have just been waiting around for that, that I‚Äôm a stalker and that i‚Äôm ‚Äúnot in the right shape to date her anyway.‚Äù

We haven‚Äôt spoke since. The finality of it has really hard on me. I‚Äôve been angry depressed the works but the whole thing just feels so wrong. I keep spiraling, trying to find away to either blame myself or get so angry that I want to reach out and tell her off. I feel like i‚Äôm out of my current therapists depth. People keep telling me I dodged a bullet, and I know somewhere that this is true, but I keep seeing their username in old friends lists and watching it disappear has me missing the friend I used to have.

I feel unlovable. This, I call it an itemized rejection, has happened a few times now. I don‚Äôt really ask for the feedback i‚Äôm just told that I am inadequate in some way like I‚Äôm. Being done a favor.

I recently decided to try to reach out for help again because my depression is just getting worse as time goes on. I will admit it has been a rough start trying to keep my appointments. One time I missed the bus, another time I was dealing with some withdrawals from medication. The most recent one my therapist was out for the week. I guess it happened one too many times because they called to ask me if maybe I wasn't ready for therapy. I said that I still wanted to try, but since my therapist is only working until May they offered to start me with someone else. I agreed and they said the front desk would call me to schedule with someone new. I haven't heard a peep back since then. 

They also referred me to someone who can possibly give me some extra help, like casemangent.

So I went to my first therapy session bc my bf found out that I started to ""scratch"" myself really bad bc I was feeling stressed and I told him and also to my therapist that I was doing it bc I was feeling overwhelmed by some uni stuff, and yeah i started bc of that (probably) BUT i feel lika that it is not the main reason of this behaviour, like there are other things that i don't know how to explain and also that I don't know how to express myself to feel understood....  I feel like i did not express myself well and that i just like, got locked on one topic.

So my first session only focused on how to deal with that uni stuff that made me start to scratch myself, but i didn't feel like what my therapist was telling me was helpful bc it was only focusing on that uni stuff. And also i did not make any improvement from my 1st session, at all, and i barely tried to ""not to"" scratch myself again so i am ashamed bc i feel like i didn't put enough effort and that the therapist may be mad or dissappointed at me if i tell them the truth. And also I am  still ignoring that uni stuff so I didn't make any improvement from my first session

Hi- I (30f) have been in the ‚Äúmental health game‚Äù over half my life now. I started when I was around 12 and started self harming. Since then I‚Äôve been in and out of therapy, psychs, even a stay at an inpatient facility at 15. The thing is‚Ä¶ after all this I still feel unwell. I can‚Äôt even count how many therapists I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúthe first session didnt vibe so cya‚Äù person so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm only seeing hundreds of people once. I typically give them a month before I decide I absolutely cannot work with this person. I‚Äôve done genesight testing (incredibly unhelpful) and I‚Äôve also tried god knows how many medications. I‚Äôve never had a provider tell me a diagnosis beyond general depression or anxiety. I‚Äôm at a loss on what to do. I‚Äôm on Medicaid now currently on waitlists but it feels like if after over half my life I haven‚Äôt gotten anything but feeling dependent and hopeless on this system I should just quit. I‚Äôve quit for a couple of years at times but I always end up trying to go back to a therapist or psych eventually, only to be put through the same exact rigamaroll including the same exact medications that gave me bad side effects or I felt did absolutely nothing. From my time at an inpatient facility I absolutely will not go back to that (assaulted by patients and staff, watched one patient get a TBI during my stay when she came back she was a veggie) I don‚Äôt have hallucinations or psychotic episodes. Regardless I‚Äôd lose my job if I went inpatient. And I‚Äôm married so I can‚Äôt be on disability. It seems like literally everything is working against me and the system is almost set up so people like me fall through the cracks. What  I supposed to do?

Do I continue paying money I don‚Äôt have to play this game? Keeping myself in forced poverty so my Medicaid doesn‚Äôt get taken away?

Do I give up and accept I will never be happy? I‚Äôm willing to try shock therapy if that‚Äôs a thing anymore. I don‚Äôt qualify for much due to my SI and tendencies though. And that reason there makes me feel like it‚Äôs set up so that folks like us ‚Äútake care of ourselves‚Äù instead of siphoning funding.

*edit - I wanted to include that the therapy offered to me in the past was emdr, cbt with worksheets/homework, and mostly just talk therapy. I think I end up hogging the session with my talking but I have so much to get out. I‚Äôve never felt ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù after a session. It feels like I must get worse to get better, and I‚Äôm terrified if I get any worse I‚Äôll lose everything. To me, losing everything is a fate worse than death.

Few days later, I went through something bad in my family, was frustrated, so I called her seeking some advice on it, and again she didn't pick up, and then I thought okay maybe she is busy, but later texted her about the problem, later she again told me to call her and she again didn't pick up, and then I messaged her again and now she started ghosting me again, not replying to texts, no clear as to why she didn't pick up, same cycle as it used to happen before I went no contact, but this time after, I had the courage to tell her how I felt about her, and wrote an honest review about the relationship, straight up then blocked her, and now I can finally say, its over, this whole boundary violation started on August last year, and 8 months past, i finally feel alive at least, she made me sick, she used to manipulate me so much and then used my own vulnerabilities against me.

NatureGeo,How to fix social disconnect and resentment?,1,1by8vr3,6,"Hi, everyone. I (M36) seem to experience a condition that I call social disconnect and resentment. 

In my younger years, I was bullied at school and failed to establish social connections with people of a similar age. I was more emotional compared to other boys, analyzed a lot, and became a bookish child. I also started to resent others as a coping mechanism and would avoid various activities. I developed some sort of shyness around guys I found cool. Something I wanted to be and yet resented. The world of science was a major relief. 

My parents were loving and supportive on a surface, but there was still some emotional disconnect with them. They clearly wouldn't reach deeper levels to help me feel more safe. There was also a lot of criticism and harsh communication about small things. 

In my twenties, I tried to be more social and yet still would feel like I don't connect well with most pairs. 
For a period of time, I was a part of a larger group of friends (met everyone through one common friend). There was drama in the group and also constant and subtle belittling of me and others by the same common friend. In my early 30s, I've decided to move on from everyone (some of the friends also got married). 

Now, in my mid-30s, I sometimes still experience social anxiety. At heart, I want to break through and connect with people again, but I often put myself down, and avoid going out when I feel bad inside. Whenever I try to connect with new people of a similar age, I hear them remark that I follow a lifestyle of an old man or appear too shy, etc. I also sometimes catch myself daydreaming about a clone of me, who is more brave, social and doing things I would dream to do, but instead sit on the couch and loath myself. I still get criticism from family for being a hermit, and they probably have a point. I sometimes feel like doing things and then block myself because of how I bad I feel or perceive my looks during a particula moment to.find excuse to not go outdoors. I also seem to have become a loner and resent social connections (fear of not being undersood or not being on par with someone, who interets me). I'm more social online these days and have noticed that people would move on after 2-3 days.

How to break through this bubble and start living more? I'm afraid I will be an old man quite soon and with no real experience of living.",1712508105.0,
Principle_Sharp,How to have a more healthier attachment style?,3,1by1cuw,2,"all my life i‚Äôve attached myself or pieces of myself to the social groups i‚Äôve been apart of and chased relationships to feel better about myself.

It‚Äôs been really hard to get past this attachment and see her move on because of all the things it made me feel about myself and i recognise low self esteem has played a part all my life in attaching myself to others for validation.

EnvironmentOne6753,Therapist told me to be more masculine? ,10,1bxtjkb,33,"I (19M) am seeing a new therapist (40 F). I am working on attachment issues. I was recently in a very abusive relationship (both physically and emotionally) and was talking about how I never would stand up for myself and would always just apologize and assume the responsibility of everything. She started talking about masculine and feminine energies, and how I may think acting feminine is comforting and approachable but really it is confusing to other people. She went on to say that oftentimes men with feminine energies end up with masculine women who tend to be angrier and sometimes violent. 

I at this point told her I was bisexual and pretty effeminate (like- as a style choice, it is what I am comfortable wearing) And she back tracked a little and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a gender or sex thing‚Äù but how else could I interpret ‚Äúmasculine and feminine energies‚Äù

I‚Äôm not gonna lie- I‚Äôm wrecked about it. I don‚Äôt attract a lot of people (especially women) and the things she said seem like they could be true.

I have a good life, a job I enjoy, friends and family, a good future, a bright life. 

I struggle with my mental health a lot and I find it difficult to be alive sometimes, but I function fine and I'm able to enjoy things. 

When people ask me if I'm happy my immediate answer is no, probably not. Or no, I hope not. I hope I'm not happy because if this is happy, then it's not good enough. I want to feel better than this. But I'm not sad or anything. I just don't feel happy enough.

But what if I am happy and I don't know it? I don't think I would know what happy felt like. And I rarely actually feel sad, I just struggle with relentless stress.

vmpybun,how to tell my therapist that i haven't been 100% honest? (tw: harmful behaviors),3,1bxut6t,4,"

i have been seeing my therapist for about a year and a half. she knows i have mental illnesses (SAD, GAD and major depressive disorder) and severe trauma but she doesn't know the extent my mental illnesses affect me. 

i've told her that when im anxious i bounce my leg and bite at my nails and when im depressed i cry and it's difficult to get out of bed. but thats just the surface level of what happens. 

when im anxious i bounce my leg and bite at my nails, yeah, but i haven't told her that i bite my nails to the point where it brings pain and even sometimes i continue after the pain. i haven't told her that i pick at my skin until it bleeds, or that i bite layers of skin off my lips and the inside of my mouth. i haven't told her that when im depressed that i just go without eating until my body is practically screaming at me to feed it, i bite myself to muffle my crying so i dont bother my family, etc etc. 

its a very scary thing to admit and tell someone about and i never figured out how to tell her. and honestly the only reason i want to be vulnerable and tell her is because these things are starting to happen more frequently and outside the comfort of home (at school, in stores, etc). i cant ask for help because my anxiety takes away all my ability to do so (aka i cannot speak to my teachers or anyone besides the people i live with and very few friends) and when in public i cant get away from the factors feeding into my anxiety. 

i've tried medication, i've tried deep breathing, i've tried anything i was told to try and nothing has helped (unless you consider being so exhausted from the medications that you sleep through the whole day as helping) idk, i've been looking into PSD's (psychiatric service dogs) and i personally feel like one would be beneficial for me but i don't know because what if i don't need one?

CheezeyNuggets,How to tell my therapist I think im autistic??,3,1bxtljj,1,"So I finally started therapy again last September. I like my therapist, she's nice- late every session- but nice. We started doing sessions over the phone so I haven't met her in person yet, but it is an option.

Anyways, I once brought up to her that I had thought I may have BPD (which I have now learned is a very common misdiagnosis for many other issues) and she just kinda told me 'no'. Which I totally get! She was honest with me and let me know that she was skeptical about it and encouraged me to learn more, but she also simultaneously put the idea down over time. She mostly implied that it was just hormones and puberty because I'm a teen (just turned 18 btw)

She's very glad I want to start processing my trauma, even suggested EMDR, which led to watch some videos. I am a chronic YouTube watcher, I will admit, but I do not watch anyone that isn't licensed or formally diagnosed on the topic of health. C-PTSD came up in these videos and I got curious, so I did a little research on it. But- I came across a video that talked about C-PTSD and Autism. Now I'm seriously considering being autistic after like 2 days of researching and watching videos T0T)/

But I'm really scared to ask my therapist when we're just starting to work on my trauma. I feel like I'm rushing my therapy or that she's gonna think I'm a self-diagnoser. I don't WANT to be Autistic, but from what I'm seeing and reading, I relate so much more to Autistic people.

So should I wait to tell her? How should I say it so she doesn't think I'm faking(?)?? My next appointment is on Monday ; -;)_

inshadesofcool,Is it insane to not get over a friendship that ended 2 years ago,2,1bxud3v,2,"My ex best friend who I cut off about two years ago keeps showing up in my thoughts almost everyday. The reason I cut him off was because he used to be completely rude towards me and that deeply hurted my insecure/low self esteemed 15 year old me, not to mention that he would gaslit me/get mad at me for stupid reasons where he wont text me back in a long time. And I would believe I was the one messing it up.

When I told him about it, he never changed his ways, so I cut ties abruptly, which lead to him never speaking again to me/acting in ways I would believe I was the bad guy. 

I assume we were both sad about everything and he never reached out to me and neither did I, because I guess I was a bit harsh in the way I kicked him out of my life, I was caught up in the heat and I may have hurt him more than he did. I realized this 3 months later.

His friends hated me, so I completely forgot for a period of time about what he did wrong, so I believed and thought that I was the bad guy and that my reasons were weak for the kind of mess I made.

Besides everything, I‚Äôve never had this type of connection with someone before, so I believe this may be one of the reasons why I keep stressing myself about this. Also we never took the time to speak deeply in person about everything that happened, he just apologized to me for the first time 6 months ago at the party of one of the friends we keep in common, and some apology sent by me almost a year ago.

I am freaking out because in those past small conversations he told me twice he didn‚Äôt want to be friends again, but I‚Äôm always thinking about how we could reconcile, inside me there‚Äôs this huge hope we will meet again sometime, even if he has pushed me out before. I even believe theories made up in my head where I assume he makes playlists in spotify to communicate with me, since we bonded over music. IDK what to do this feels super unhealthy!!!!!!!!!

so i am in psychoanalytic therapy since over two years. i can't change my therapist because its very hard to find somebody, even the waiting lists are full. yet i feel so overwhelmed with him or rather - underchallenged, idk. we talk nicely each session, but every time he tells me ""yeah your ED has underlying causes"" and i'm being like dude just tell me what it is then, i feel like he knows actually what is wrong with me and he is playing hide and seek with me until i find out. i feel like i am missing out on something very obvious which makes me feel¬†**so**¬†stupid.

the therapy does not have any direction, we rarely proceed with the topics and i feel like my therapy session is just ""chilling"" for him because i don't have any ""real"" problems (compared to his other patients) and this is why he is ""keeping"" me.

i am so stuck, i don't want my life to proceed like this. but i also cannot change my therapist, i am so overwhelmed with everything. but something HAS to change. i hate the way i am so much every day. also i am a huge over-analyzer so talking and analyzing everything in the sessions acutally isn't really helpful to me.

I¬†*know*¬†that my problems are low self-esteem and being scared of talking to people. then i told him i started going to dance classes to build my confidence which has actually helped me(!) a lot to feel better on those days, but then he told me that this was just another coping mechanism to run away from what i was ""really"" feeling.

Like, what? I think I have a point if i don't like myself when i am laying on the couch chilling all day and if dancing/getting out of my comfort zone gives me self-esteem. i feel like he tries to talk me into things that i actually am not, i was so happy with dancing but now i don't know if i should proceed as it is ""jUsT anOther wAy oF runNinG away"" because i really really just wanna get better. but WHAT am i supposed to do if everything in his eyes is just running away from my problems? don't worry, I asked him that. then he answers with his usual ""there are underlying reasons for how you are feeling.."" as if i should know and as if i wouldn't tell him but honestly,

Lets say i practice the same amount of guitar as someone else and the other person is still better then me despite practicing the same way and the same amount. Wouldn‚Äôt that mean that the other person is just more talented? Lets say is give my all at school and i study, study and study but other students are outperforming me with no effort. Doesn‚Äôt this actually mean they are smarter than me? If there is a guy that is popular with women and never had any issues getting girlfriends and im 24 and never got anybody to like despite me trying to be the best person i can be. Doesnt that mean he is just more lovable than me?

I just dont understand how anybody could see anything positive in this situations. Im currently starting to stagnate with my therapist because he constantly trys to convince me that there is a more positive way of looking at things but i dont see how it would be possible to see anything positive in such situations.

I believe my low self opinion is justified. My therapist trys to gaslight me into believing other wise but why would 24 year old virgin who is below average in every regard have a high opinion of himself? Of course you could say i could change things about my self but i already tried my best and it still wasn‚Äôt enough and even if i could change things the fact that it took me so much longer than other will always make me feel below other people 

Even if i could get a woman to like me in a few years i would still feel inferior to all the man who got relationships since they were 16 and never had to do any self improvement to be lovable enough. Because working an eternity to get into just 1 relationship doesn‚Äôt make me feel any good when other people have a mountain of relationships by simply being themselfs. Even if i got into a relationship i would constantly wonder why she is with me when there are better men out there. I also would be envious of her previous partners not because of slut shaming but because i also want to have a high body count, i also want to have relationship experiences with different people. But actually this paragraph is completely meaningless since i already tried to be the best version of myself and it still wasn‚Äôt enough to get someone to like me.

So why would someone like me see anything positive in those situations? I think psychology gaslight itself into believing that its just a matterof perspective but some existences just suck. I tried everything and it wasn‚Äôt enough and even i could change anything i would still feel resentful about the fact that it took me so long and that i have so little experience.

Ive never been so in love with someone my whole life (ive been in 2 two year long relationships B4 this) and i dont know where else to talk about this without my friends calling me crazy. I can admit i am crazy for wanting a girl so bad that had problems with her father and never seen a healthy relationship, but I TRIED SO HARD to make things work because things seem to have been going so smoothly until it wasnt. 

First date went by, and ive been on plenty of dates and i can tell you right now that this was the best date ive ever had in my entire 22 years of being on this planet. We were together for about 5 months when things just turned sideways and now she was afraid of commitment, and intimidated of starting a future and officially settling down in fear that I can end up like her father or someone that doesnt treat her right. Now all the little things riled her up to use as excuses to try to leave me which eventually it worked at my brothers 26th birthday party in a cabin she decides now is the perfect time to break up with me. 

I cant believe my brothers birthday vacation/party was gonna be one of the worst days of my life. We talked after because she called me crying on how she wants to fix things, but after realize she really isnt ready and its best to give her space and she offered me to stay as a friend, and I know i cant just be my exes friend, so i told her i am okay with waiting as long as you go to therapy and we focus on our selves. During the 2 months of this she proceeded to break the no contact almost every 2 days with the first comment being ‚Äúis this leading you on‚Äù‚Ä¶.. YES IT VERY MUCH IS. For those 2 months i was the crazy one staying there as she was slowly pushing me away every phone call and even told me ‚Äúyeah as of now, living this single life is what i plan on doing.‚Äù

I couldnt take it anymore mentally. I had a friend from the military come back in town and he told me (just like every other friend) that im stupid and crazy for staying in this ‚Äúno contact‚Äù thing when shes just pushing me away. I was drinking heavily for almost 5 days straight with my friend to ‚Äúcelebrate‚Äù and they told me almost every time i would get super drunk and cry and always brought her up and realized how insane i was becoming. The 6th day we go out to a popular local bar and i find a girl that i knew in highschool and we were hitting it off to the point where my mind was pushing away from my ex finally, and just focusing on being free and when this girl grabs me to kiss‚Ä¶ my ex was at the bar watching everything go down.

I walk up to my friends to let them know im getting another drink with this girl and they told me that my ex was here and i didnt believe them until i saw my phone. Angered messages were sent at me and i was so pissed off because WHY WAS SHE MAD AT ME WHEN I WAS BEGGING FOR HER FOR 2 WHOLE MONTHS!! I even misread messages of hers (her saying she got my friends number and how shes with him) because i was too drunk to see straight, and out of anger that made me take this girl home and sleep with her. We talked the day after that night and she cried to me showing messages with her friend saying how shes going to try to fix things with me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. it hurts so much knowing i was a day away from being with the girl i thought i would die with. WHY WASNT SHE TEXTING ME, WHY WAS SHE TEXTING HER FRIEND WHEN I BEGGED FOR ANY FORM OF REASSURANCE, I WOULDVE NEVER EVEN PROCESSED BEING WITH SOMEONE ELSE IF SHE JUST TOLD ME ANYTHING ABOUT WANTING TO TRY WITH ME AGAIN.

Believe it or not we still tried things again after that but it had became too toxic where one little thing turns into a big argument to where we leave each other for what I thought was the last time. I was officially trying to move on now, but i was most definitely still in love with her and unfortunately was even getting attached to the toxicity (which is where i knew this is not healthy). A week has passed by and I go out to a friends house and come home late after having a good time trying to focus on myself finally‚Ä¶. 

Its 2am and i get a long message from her and before i can read it she deletes it thinking i blocked her and of course i respond. It was her saying shes been crying all night thinking about me and how she wants to fix things. Of course delusional me was actually happy because yes i missed her, but she tells me that she went on a date and she ended up reaching the point of her sleeping with this man but stopped it instantly cause she started to cry about how much she misses her ex (she showed messages as proof). Idk how to feel anymore, she couldve just never texted me, i get it she wanted to try to fix things but it took her less than a week to end up trying with another man SOBER and instantly reaching that point. 

She was in my car begging how she doesnt want to lose me, and before i could finally leave, i left my car lights on and my battery died and i slept in my car and she refused to leave the car so she brought me a blanket from her house and we fell asleep in my car while we waited 2 HOURS for AAA (it was 4am). i get it i cant be mad, i technically did the same thing, but ouch it hurts knowing she apparently ‚Äúmissed me‚Äù while doing that when she wasnt in my mind anymore when i did it. I dont know how long it will take me to move on from my first ever toxic relationship. Im very crushed now cause theres a girl who wants me back but also i cant go back knowing she did that‚Ä¶ or can i? Idk anymore. I dont know what to think anymore ive been so depressed ever since this final incident, i love her so much that i still want to try to fix things cause i guess were even right‚Ä¶.. If anyone reads this i really need help & could use any advice please.

Which me and my brother would be in the same room playing a video game but hear our mom scream and throw shit at our dad.

To which my brain thought it was about us and this was early 2000s we didn‚Äôt have much money for headphones or shit like that because of our mom, our grandparents weren‚Äôt any better never really letting us (mostly me) express my emotions and hell never even really letting me hug them most of the time and saying stuff like ‚ÄùI‚Äôll give you something to cry about‚Äù and never calling my brother out for all the torment he put me through (One of the worst is shoving me in a dog crate and pushing me down stairs) 

My only real saving grace was my nan (mother‚Äôs mom) as she would not only save me from most of the terrorism my parents started up but saving me from all the borderline neglect from my other grandparents, the only other time I‚Äôd be free from my grandparents is at school while others had fun I‚Äôd just sit somewhere and cry. 

The worst part of everything is whenever I would see my mother she‚Äôd be with a different guy after splitting with my dad 2 separate times and one guy was the absolute worst choking her a few times before I finally heard it and stepped in at 9 years old he was 30 something!

All this to say, I guess I have some raw spots around being unloveable and rejection. 

I'm in therapy and we're working through self-soothing. One balance I'm not sure of is when should I be self-soothing without bringing up those feelings I'm navigating with my partner vs when should I include him. Tonight, I got to the point where I started crying when he wasn't around and wondering if I should approach him or self soothe. 

Relationships go through easy and hard times. We've been in a patch the last week where things feel a little more distant and I'm also super hormonal. All of that is making me wonder if I'm loved by him and feel alone, but I know a lot of it is just because of my raw spot and the shift in my emotions due to my cycle. We talked about the distance a bit tonight, and then when he left the room for awhile to tackle a few things, I tried to self soothe but ended up crying. He had no idea it was happening and I just cuddled my dog while navigating feelings. 

My question is - is that the right approach? Not going to him made me feel alone, but going to him makes me feel like I'm not successfully self soothing like I'm learning in therapy. ",1712374078.0,
,what's going on here?,2,1bx3mg9,0,"okay so this is likely going to be a somewhat long post but i don't know where else to turn right now! i need some advice on how to proceed in this situation. i will try my best to summarize & simplify this story but there's a lot of context here so bear with me.

personal info: 24 yrs, female
location: united states

so back in the fall of 2023 i was due for a physical with my primary care doctor and i had scheduled my appointment for the day before thanksgiving because it was literally the only available booking that wouldn't require me to take a day off work. well, i got a call that my provider needed to cancel my appointment and i had to reschedule. i found out that because there was nothing available for a while, and it was nearing a full year since my last physical, they would not be able to continue prescribing my adhd medication (adderall). i could not get another appointment in time, so i decided to take my records to a different provider that i'd seen off and on for various things over the years and get things set up with him so that i could get my medication. this doctor is a small practice and has more flexibility in scheduling appointments (sometimes they can get you in same-day) so i thought this was the best option.

i should provide some context here: i have been diagnosed with several mental health conditions that i am currently managing with a few medications that my previous primary care provider (let's call her dr. amanda) had prescribed. like i said, this other doctor (let's call him dr. patrick), had seen me off and on for years but didn't prescribe any of my daily meds and was not where i went for my physicals and whatnot. however, around 2018, before i'd started seeing dr. amanda for any mental health related card, i had been in a rather difficult phase and my mom & i had seen dr. patrick with some of the concerns, hoping to get some advice on what to do and how to proceed. my mom had recommended him.

it was at this 2018 appointment that we discussed some of the issues i was experiencing and i expressed that i was concerned these were symptoms of adhd or depression (or both) and dr. patrick felt i did not have adhd, but instead bipolar disorder, and recommended a psychiatrist to follow up with. i went to a few appointments with this psychiatrist (who felt i had borderline personality disorder) and in the end i never got a clear diagnosis or any treatment plan so i stopped going. eventually these issues came up during a regular appointment with dr. amanda and she started me on lexapro in 2018 for depression & anxiety symptoms.

over the years, we tweaked and modified my medication plan without me really getting a clear diagnosis but with certain additions and dosages i began to even out. in march of 2023, i finally went to another psychiatrist for my issues and took the brown executive function screening and was diagnosed with severe adhd, combined type. according to my brown scale report, i scored in the 99th percentile and exhibit symptoms of both inattentive and hyperactive adhd (combined). with this information, dr. amanda started me on adderall. it was a huge improvement and my life rapidly improved.

by fall of 2023, i was taking the following medications and dosages for my mental health:
- escitalopram (lexapro) 20mg
- buspirone 20mg
- adderall 20mg

all of these were prescribed by dr. amanda and i was doing well. i only needed to change doctors because of the physical requirement for my adderall and the scheduling difficulties. so in december i returned to dr. patrick for a physical and asked that he begin prescribing my daily meds. at this appointment, dr. patrick seemed surprised that i was taking adderall and remarked that he would continue prescribing it although he didn't like it. i brought along my brown scale report and all my notes from dr. amanda. we actually decided to increase my adderall to 30mg because i mentioned having some relapsing symptoms during the day and noticing a possible decrease in its effectiveness since starting at 20mg in march of 2023. i felt good about this. after discussing the adderall he told me he wanted to take me off of lexapro, and said he didn't think it was doing anything anymore (i've been on it since 2018). he said you can get used to it and we should taper down to 15mg and gradually reduce my dosage, so when i left that day i started taking 15mg instead of 20.

at my follow-up appointment in 1 month, i mentioned that i was concerned that maybe my moods had been a little unpredictable and that i felt like i was more irritable and depressed in the evenings when my adderall had worn off, and i inquired a bit more about why we needed to stop my lexapro. he said we would reduce it down to 10mg and that he felt like ""something else was going on"" but didn't elaborate much. at this point i began to feel uncomfortable about the whole situation and was concerned about this change, but i went along with it.

i had another follow-up appointment a month later which i called the office and canceled before time, because it was becoming too expensive to make the appointments and pay for my medications. each appointment was billing around $175 and my adderall alone (even the generic) is around $140. since the end of december i calculated spending $718 on doctor visits and prescriptions alone. i also felt wary of changing my medication further, so i called and explained that my insurance wasn't covering the visits and that i needed to wait to come back because i couldn't afford it right now. i was very polite.

the next time i called to refill my adderall (you have to get a new rx every month) i asked if i could use a different pharmacy because it was less expensive there. the receptionist told me that was fine and later that day i went to pick up my adderall and they didn't have it - they were out of stock. i called back to dr. patrick's office and told them that the other pharmacy didn't have any adderall in stock so could they please send it to my usual pharmacy. they told me they would give it to him and it would be ready after 5 pm. i went to the pharmacy and they didn't have it. i couldn't call back because they were now closed, and it was a friday! i had 2 adderall left so i skipped saturday but i had a bad day and needed to get some work done so i took one sunday, and then the last on monday. when i called on monday, dr. patrick's office was closed, and they are also closed every tuesday. i had to skip my medication on tuesday. i sent a message to my doctor through their website and later got a reply that was somewhat standoffish, saying that he had already sent this prescription 3 or 4 times and asking what pharmacy i had ""finally"" decided to use. but i finally got my adderall on wednesday.

fast forward one month. i have called back to dr. amanda to try to go back to her because the situation feels uncomfortable with dr. patrick and i'm concerned i won't be able to get my medication when i need it. they tell me they can't accept me back because they're not taking new patients, and i suppose me requesting my full records kicked me out of their system. so i am trying to find a new doctor in the meantime. this brings us up to this week. it's wednesday and i have 3 adderall left and call dr. patrick for my refill and the receptionist says okay we'll send it in. i get a call back from their office saying that he cannot fill this prescription because it has been 3 months since my last appointment in january and he needs to see me every 3 months. i told them i needed this refill soon and was able to schedule the appointment for the next day after work.

but the thing is, it hadn't been 3 months. i was confused and felt weird about the situation so i looked and my last appointment (when he reduced my lexapro the second time) was on january 28th, and this was april 3rd. 3 months from january 28th would be april 28th. since it was inconvenient to schedule the appointment after work, i called back and told them there must've been an error because it hadn't been 3 months and asked if i could reschedule for later and go ahead and get my refill. i was put on hold when the receptionist came back, i was told that it wasn't that it needed to be 3 months, but that dr. patrick had written on my last prescription that he wanted to see me back before my next refill. i was confused but said okay and left the appointment.

i went home and looked at my pill bottle and didn't see anything on there about it, and i didn't have the bag / label that it comes in anymore, so i called the pharmacy to ask if maybe the note had been printed and i threw it away without noticing, and they told me that there was a note in the system from dr. patrick, but that this information is not printed anywhere on the label or anything received by the customer. they also didn't tell me verbally when i picked up the last refill. what really bothered me about this is that i had spoken to them on the phone several times when getting this refill - so why didn't they tell me this on the phone? i didn't find out i had to come back until i called. and why did he need to see me? i am starting to feel very confused and uncomfortable at this point because i had reservations before about decreasing my lexapro, and he didn't really listen to me or explain why, and then i had to postpone my appointment for financial reasons, but now i feel like he is holding my adderall hostage until i come back for an appointment.

anyway, i had my mom come with me to the appointment and it was very awkward. my mom asked some questions and tried to help me speak up about my concerns, and we were very polite and respectful. when she asked why he felt i needed to stop taking my lexapro, he told us that lexapro treats affective disorders like depression and that he felt i had a mood disorder. he said that it would be better to replace the lexapro with a mood stabilizer. he referenced his notes mentioned symptoms i had described in 2018, but he also said some things that i did not relate to, like staying up and going without sleep, which, if anything, is the opposite of how i am! if I could i would sleep all day. i generally sleep way too much when i'm not on my adhd meds. i tried to express some of my reservations and concerns, and honestly by the end of the appointment i was more confused than before. i didn't really even want the appointment, but was forced to go because i needed my adderall. we ""agreed"" to wait to continue reducing the lexapro until i am off work for the summer (i'm a teacher) and he is going to continue prescribing my adderall now for 3 months.

at this point i'm just looking for a new doctor because i feel like all of this is happening to me, against my will. i have lost a lot of money and now feel like all these issues are being dredged up again. mood disorder? what? i am so confused. i didn't want any of these changes. i was fine with my lexapro before, and i didn't have any side effects or issues. i don't understand why he wants to change things and i don't understand why he thinks i have a mood disorder. obviously my symptoms are too much to explain and this post is already too long - but i don't know what any of this means or if this makes sense. my parents seem to trust dr. patrick but they don't really understand either. can someone chime in with their opinion? is he doing the right thing and am i just overreacting? should i continue to search for a new doctor? i'm feeling very confused and unsettled about all of this. sorry for the extremely long post. i didn't know how else to explain things without leaving out something that might be important.

My mom was passing through town and stopped to have dinner with me. As we are sitting down at a restaurant, she tells me that she has something she wants to talk about with me but I can‚Äôt tell the rest of the family (all immediate family members and extended family). She proceeds to tell me that she recently got some scary news about her health. She has to have surgery to prevent further damage. Without the surgery, the issue will worsen to the point that she develops cancer. I also want to note that the surgery is endoscopic with a pretty short recovery time. The worst part is one week of a liquid diet afterwards. She tells me that she doesn‚Äôt really want to have the surgery though because it doesn‚Äôt fix the initial reason she went to see the doctor. Because it‚Äôs not a simple fix, she wants to skip it altogether. I tried my best to reason with her that the surgery doesn‚Äôt sound as bad as it could be and that she has a new grandchild to dote on.

I‚Äôm not religious so I didn‚Äôt respond to that and instead asked her why she wasn‚Äôt telling anyone else in the family. She said she doesn‚Äôt want everyone pressuring her and telling her what to do.

PainInHerBones,"Heavy Crying, Inability to Directly Talk About ""My Problem""?",3,1bwpx6b,1,"In general, I'm a pretty cheery person with a high mental baseline. I don't sad-cry very much and I think I'm pretty happy, especially now at this stage of my life.

However, when I go into the therapy session, I chit chat about the week's happening in a good mood, laughing, bragging even about how great life is, and then segue that into talking about ""my problem"". I can't directly talk about it, in real life, though I can talk about it in text online anonymously. I speak in riddles and euphemisms to get the point across, and it's super embarrassing. Then, when I start talking about it, I start crying. Like, h-heavy. crying. <gasp>. where I <sob>. S-stop e-every <gasp> two <sob> words. I can get through the session, but I usually go in and out of that heavy crying state as long as we're talking about this particular topic.

I mentioned ""my problem"" on the intake, and sought him out specifically because he's an expert in the area, but I only talked about other things for the first two months because I couldn't broach the topic. How do I get over this? He says the best thing I can do now is keep coming to him, or another safe person if I ever find one, and just keep talking about it until I eventually get more comfortable... but I've been doing this since September and have only gotten maybe a little better about it. 

I love my therapist and I really appreciate his insight. I have made a lot of progress on my problem and while I struggle to do the homework, it's easier for me to actually do than to talk about.

Some recent examples of this: my uncle died last summer. 

I was really close with my uncle I stayed at his house with my cousin all summer long my whole childhood. He would alway refer to me as his second son. When I found out he was about to die. I felt bad for my aunt and my cousin. I guess I felt sad but I distinctly remember not feeling sad enough about it. I never once cried. I was really more or less okay. Sometimes I remember that he‚Äôs not going to be at the next family event and that makes me sad for a moment but that is all. This was someone I knew for almost 30 years and I was close with and overall I feel like his death didn‚Äôt affect me much and that makes me feel worse than his actual death did.

From this January I have different therapist and I've been thinking about my former therapist. We ended our sesions because she has a baby but I get this anger inside of me because I think I have been manipulated and used. She was my first therapist and works at SFBT therapy, I didin't know what to expcept, I just wanted to get help. At that time I wasn't aware that Im a fucking people pleaser, I go in 100% and then when somebody hurt me just a little Im gone because I always get manipulated by somebody from my birth. At the first sesion I remember I told her I don't want to dissapoint her and she said that is my therapy and we'll work on my problems together.


Couple of months go by and I've made a little progress, I open up more and more, Im more confident. One time I commented something about tarot cards and crystals, that Im curious about that stuff but Im not sure if its real and she go really REALLY deffensive, I immetiadely shut down and let her speak, the air was thick and suffocating. Second time I was not feeling mentally well, everything felt grey, I had pessimistic attitude. I told her that I had really bad thoughts when I was in high school and she just looked at me and said in threatening voice ""Now I shoud call mental institution, do you want that?"" it was insane I didin't have this thoughs NOW but when I was 18 years old. And the she said whithout emphaty in her voice that I always take one step forward and two steps back, something switched im me from now on I was hiding my true feelings more and more, I was acting just to fit in into her world and it worked, I just wanted to be accepted, one day she invited me into her studio when she organises various spiritual workshops (yoga, astrology, gongs, numerology, chacrotherapy) and I got hooked into that. Im not spiritual person but I'm curious about this stuff and when I said that she always said that im not ready to understand it and I felt stupid because of that. It goes like this for about a year, I spend more and more money on the workshops and her theraphy in the meantime she ask me if I can babysit her dog I agreed because I got free sesions for that.¬†


Sesions morph from theraphy to paid friend talk. When I told her I can't go at one of the workshops because I've been strugling financially I Heard that I just got to work on myself and money will come eventually. One time I went to chacrotherapy and I remembered that I was SA so on next sesion I told her about that and other stuff from my chilchood (bullying, beating, mental abuse), she listens and says that my spirit choose that situation so I can grow and I should forgive the persons who did it because when I do that our spirits will heal.

As time goes on I finally got a feeling that we are going nowere with this but I was teeling myself that it has a meaning, that I have good mood so theraphy is working.

Then december last year comes and she gave a birth, and our sesions ended but that's not the end of the story.


Some weeks ago she called me and asked if I wanted to be a part of her and hers partner holistic festival, I thought it was great opportunity to learn new things and I agreed but Oh Boy I regreet it.

When her partner is looking for artists first he looks at what number of followers individual has, to me its dissgusting to look at a person's value through the prism of followers. After each meeting I feel mentaly drained and frustrated because I really want to help and honestly I don't know what do they want out of me, everyday I thinking of quiting because I do it for free.

I live a very unhealthy and sedentary lifestyle. And it shows, as I‚Äôm currently standing 5‚Äô11 at 243 pounds. I‚Äôm rather unattractive, I don‚Äôt have a sense of style and I come from a mostly unsupportive and unloving home that has slowly stopped caring for me. My 3 siblings are all adults and I as the youngest child am the only one left living at home. My parents hate each other, and are basically strangers who don‚Äôt sleep in the room as each other, constantly argue, and reciprocate absolutely zero love towards each other. And now, both of them are basically too consumed in their own lives to care for their son. I got nothing for my 15th birthday, nor was I given anything for Christmas. And even now, we still aren‚Äôt actually throwing a party. Both of them are gone most of the day, my mom is god knows where with men (it‚Äôs been an open secret she has been cheating for years at this point) and my dad is at the bar all day presumably also with women. And then there is me, alone in my room. 

I would describe myself as rather smart, and I have a knack for history. I‚Äôm also pretty funny I think, though most of my comedy is just self deprecation as a form of defence. It just so happens to be entertaining to others I guess. 

I think I want to get a job, save, and move out as quickly as possible. I plan on either joining the clergy or becoming a history teacher. Though I‚Äôm not sure how foreseeable either of those are. I am generally an insecure and shy person but I think I just hide it well.

She and her kids (my 2 nephews, and 1 niece) are very supportive of me, and I often find myself spending long periods of time sleeping at their house to escape my home life.

I have problems in communication with people because of the Choleric type behavior. Specifically, I tend overreact and overanalyze what others said.

I am reading self-help books for the last 10 years, trying to change myself more towards Melancholic or even Flegmatic type, because people like the calmer personalities more...

But it doesn't change in the core, my main behavior patterns stay the same. All what I got is a skill to pretend to be calm and patient, but I am playing a role, not changing.

When I take SSRI in the winter period, they make me very Flegmatic, very calm, and people like me more. But I don't want to live such a life always taking SSRI.

Is it possible to change? Should I keep pretending and be unhappy or should I be myself and don't care about people? But then how can I socialize, without causing friction?",1712309982.0,

1.) I find her to be very friendly and personable, but I‚Äôm not sure that I connect with her to a point where I feel safe and comfortable with her. This is more of a vibe, which I can totally look past as just me being uncertain in a new environment. 
2.) I find her communication to be lacking, which is something I really value in this type of relationship. I find myself constantly chasing her down to confirm and schedule appointments. I emailed billing requesting receipts and no one ever responded to me. I reached out to the therapist when I was having a tough day with my son via email looking for guidance and received an email essentially telling me to examine his sleep schedule and his diet. 
3.) I‚Äôve only had one parent-only session so far and was expecting more coaching on my end to help navigate issues at home. I understand that a relationship needs to be established, but I‚Äôm just not getting much of anything I can do to help at home beyond a book that was suggested.

Superwholock_14,Should I try to see my old therapist?,3,1bw4lxn,0,"So in my early adult/post college life, I saw a lot of different therapists because I moved jobs/states a good bit and then I was using a community health therapy center and I somehow went through 3 therapists in 2 years because people kept leaving the center. It takes me a very long time to connect and warm up to a therapist probably because I just felt like it was annoying having to start over all the time because no one was in it for the long haul.

Anyways, the last therapist I had at the community center I was super attached to. I finally felt connected and like I could share my dark, scary feelings and show emotions in session, but then she left to do inpatient psych at a hospital. Her leaving was absolutely devastating to me and I spent our last 8 sessions crying the whole time because it felt like my breaking point. I was in a super dark place, a close family member of mine had passed, I was transitioning to a new job, and a few other things had happened and I was basically in crisis during the season she told me she was leaving. She was also the first therapist who spotted my adhd symptoms and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you have severe anxiety, I think you have raging untreated adhd that has built up for 26yrs‚Äù. So I was also having panic attacks daily when she left and was waiting for a testing appointment for adhd. I was seeing her 2X/wk and I‚Äôm honestly embarrassed by how upset I was when she left. 

Since she‚Äôs left I‚Äôve tried 2 different therapists the last year and a half and just haven‚Äôt connected well with either. I‚Äôm about to try a new therapist next week, this one specializing in late diagnosed adhd. However, every so often I get the urge to see if that therapist ever goes back into outpatient therapy and it just so happens today I saw where she started with a new company. I really want to start working with her again, but honestly I‚Äôm so embarrassed by how I acted our last several sessions. I worry she was sick of me by the end and wouldn‚Äôt want to work with me again. 

Since she‚Äôs left, I‚Äôve made a lot of progress. I got the adhd diagnosis, started on meds for adhd, weaned off my anxiety meds, still have some anxiety/depression but no where near as bad.

Flypike87,What's the point,1,1bwaspd,0,"I have struggled with mental issues all of my life. My father passed away from cancer when I was 7. I was born an old man so I knuckled under and started helping my mom help take care of the farm and my little brother. Obviously it wasn't right of my mom to allow me to feel that burden. With almost 37 trips around the sun I have come to understand my mother has her own issues and it would be inappropriate for me to place blame on someone that was struggling herself. It can't be easy to be a 27 year old widow with two little boys to take care of while battling your own demons.

Sorry for the diatribe. A few years ago I finally reached a point were I felt I could ask for help. Since then I have spoke with a about a dozen different therapists, mostly on the phone. Four of them I spoke to for multiple sessions. I only every felt somewhat comfortable with one of the therapists which I seen 12-13 times over 4 months. The last time I seen her she told me she was changing companies and I would have to find a new therapist immediately. It was probably for the best because I never received a treatment plan or any guidance from any of them quacks. It was just listening and ""understanding""!

Kind_Ad_3187,How can I overcome my insecurity over my intelligence?,3,1bw3fnd,2,"I usually start to notice this in really only one kind of situation: I‚Äôll be scrolling social media and I‚Äôll be reading what people have to say. It could be a comment on a news article, or even a group of people discussing some aspect of religion. It doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôll read what other people are saying and think things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never have thought of that‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything interesting at all to say here‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a harder time than usual to understand what‚Äôs even being said here‚Äù, etc. 

I‚Äôve also noticed that I‚Äôve been compensating for my perceived lack of intelligence by burying my face in books on subjects that interest me. I suppose the thought is that if I just educate myself on the sort of topics I‚Äôm reading about online, then I‚Äôll naturally be able participate in these sort of conversations and have interesting things to say like other people do. 

But things haven‚Äôt worked out that way. Yeah, I‚Äôve gained a lot of information on some topics, but all I seem to be able to do with this is parrot it back. When I observe other people talking, I see them actually put forward their own genuine thoughts. They read what other people say and immediately respond with thoughts of their own. With me, I parrot, it takes me ages to think of things to say, and if it‚Äôs on a subject I haven‚Äôt read about extensively I‚Äôm just paralysed (because I can‚Äôt resort to parroting). 

It‚Äôs hard for me to overstate how awfully this is making me feel and how it‚Äôs affecting my behaviour, but here are some points:

- there‚Äôs something like a self-fulfilling prophecy going on here. During these online discussions, I‚Äôm constantly in my own head - judging myself and feeling awfully. I‚Äôm evaluating every single one of my thoughts to see whether it‚Äôs intelligent enough to be sent and whether other people will perceive me as stupid if I send it. It‚Äôs paralysing. I usually end up saying nothing and just observing other people, which confirms my suspicions that I‚Äôm too stupid to say anything interesting. 
- intelligence has always been tied to worth to me. I feel like I‚Äôm right at the bottom of the social hierarchy because of all of this.
- I don‚Äôt cry often - probably once every few years - but today I cried so much after thinking about this whole thing for longer than usual. It happened after I was sitting on one of these online conversations again. I must‚Äôve sat there in silence for over an hour, mentally beating myself up the entire way. 

Look, I know all of this is insane and that this post probably reads like the words of a madman, but Jesus Christ I needed to vent.

Let me explain, I've always been aware that everyone should have their own opinions and beliefs, and truthfully, others' beliefs had never affected me before. I knew it was just their stance. But for some reason, at the beginning of this year, I've been obsessed with seeking answers to what I believe. I was a Christian, but seeing comedians like Tim Minchin mock and present valid arguments against Christianity and God, and seeing people agreeing with him and rejecting religion, made me feel bad, so I abandoned my religion but not the idea of God. I sought to adopt a more rational stance on God, deism. I searched for answers that would satisfy my beliefs. After a day of tranquility, the next day I would search for any refutation and I would find it, which generated more anxiety and led me to join a deist subreddit in search of answers to that refutation. I found them and once again felt tranquil. But again, the next day, I felt the need to know if someone had already refuted deism or had stopped being a deist, and so the vicious circle would continue without stopping, not letting me think about anything else. I don't know what to do; I feel like I'm being influenced too much by people and internet artists rather than my own belief, because I know I'm not smart enough to accept my belief as valid and I feel the need to depend on others' opinions to validate what I believe and whether it's rational.

I want to firmly believe in what I believe, God, but I feel greatly affected by people who oppose me, who criticize and mock what I believe. It also affects me to know that people easily give up on the idea of God, and the number of atheists is growing rapidly, leaving no room for me as a deist because there will always be someone on the internet mocking and criticizing those who believe in some kind of God, like Minchin, saying it's more probable to find extraterrestrials and intelligent life than a creator of the universe.

I have really bad social anxiety, I know my thought patterns, I know these are intrusive thoughts, I know where they come from, I know they aren't logical. Yet it feels like my therapist wants to focus on these aspects. Trying to get me to ""come to the realization"" that they are illogical thoughts, that they come from a deep rooted need of validation and fear of being rejected due to how my parents treated me.  
I know all of this, that's why I went to therapy!!!! Yet it feels like I'm just being told everything that I already know. I'm not even sure what I want at this point. I mean, I want to get rid of these horrible thoughts and feelings I get whenever I'm around people, but I don't even know what that looks like. I don't want to spend an hour just being told to ""practice square breathing"" and ""learn to identify these thoughts"". Like, it feels like nothing that I'm told in therapy is new. I've literally not come to a single realization, not had a single ""a-ha!"" moment. I've known everything that I've told my therapist and everything my therapist has told me for a long time now. Again, that's why I sought out therapy.  
I hear and see people talking about how therapy helped them realize things about themselves, and how it brings up a lot of emotions and feelings, and how they figure out the root causes of the issues for them to try to work through. The only thing I've figured out from therapy is that I really hate the emotions wheel.  
Like, it'd make sense if I consciously thought I was undeserving of love and I was worthless, and because of that nobody actually wants to talk to me and secretly hates me. Therapy would obviously be good in that situation, help you work through those issues and figure out that you aren't unlovable and worthless.  
But what about me??? I know logically that's not the case, and I truly believe that. It's just whenever I'm around people my body doesn't care about what I actually think and believe. I'm not going to come to some realization that people don't hate me, I KNOW THAT. Again, that's why I went to therapy, because I know people don't hate me but for some reason my body decides to mess with me and react as if they do whenever I'm around someone.  
Like, I don't typically go to therapy while I'm in the middle of having a nervous breakdown, so I typically think logically and rationally and therefore nothing I'm told is a revelation to me.

Based on the problematic patterns I've seen in myself and on events in my childhood I assume that I mostly likely have a (comparatively mild) pre-verbal trauma which is at the core of my issues.
I believe that I am already pretty self-aware and I try to logically fight my dysfunctional patterns when I can but that alone hasn't been enough.
Hence I'm skeptical that talk therapy (CBT/Psychoanalysis) alone will change much (also it's said to be rather useless for trauma).
Thus I have been planning to directly contact a specialist for pre-verbal trauma and ask for an explorative session (I guess, idk how this works).
I'm hoping that by this I can avoid just treating (some of the) symtoms - the healthcare system in my country likes to give people just some generic short-term behavioral therapy that doesn't go deep.

And after the intake questions there was this really awkward period of him just trying to get me to like talk? It was kinda strange ngl. He was expecting me to just talk about everything? 

He was like well usually how this goes is client talks and therapist listens and like obviously you know? But I'm not the type to just ramble on about my problems I keep everything in which is one of the main reasons I sought out therapy lol. Then I kinda wanted to avoid another awkward gap so I asked how long he was a therapist and he told me his experience which basically a few years. Maybe this isn't a good fit? He's a nice guy but I'm very self aware and I know that of I don't have structure or of I'm not being asked I'm not about to just spill my life naturally idk? I was under the impressions the therapist would use the intake questions and more so follow up on them like so you said this... do you think you might know why this problem has arised? You know like that?! 

Then he was like well next session I will do a depression questionnaire in the beginning if that's OK with you I said yes. My main concern tho is my self esteem not really depression so I feel like this might not go anywhere?

I would never have put a ring on her if I was unwilling to accept the risk.¬† But this stings way worse than I thought it would.¬† We started trying to have a baby back in 2016 when she went off birth control entirely. After years of it not working, we knew something wasn't right, and last year decided to try a round of IVF.

Her numbers were not very good even going into it and it was very risky. ¬†We only were able to retrieve one viable egg, and although it was successfully fertilized, it ultimately failed. ¬†Her IVF doctor was truly a brilliant man and suspected her remaining ovary had begun to shut down. ¬†Further testing from her gynecologist confirmed what we were afraid was true. ¬†She had been officially diagnosed with Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) and had begun the transformation into menopause. ¬†It would be impossible for us to have our own biological children, and if she did not treat the condition with replacement hormones, she would likely die in her 50s.

So there it was, written down, finite, finally forcing us to abandon all hope. She is obviously still going through the stages of grief... mostly anger mixed with guilt. ¬†Anger towards me, the situation, God, the universe, whatever. ¬†Guilty for the fact she can't give me what she knows I so longingly wanted. ¬†And what do I feel?¬† Pure, seething hatred.¬† Not at her‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt place it.¬† Some days it‚Äôs so poisonous I could burn down the world. ¬†All I know how to do is to re-direct it as pure energy into something, anything more positive.¬† I am 35-year-old man who loves his wife like no other person on the planet but wanted kids since I was a kid. ¬†Drifting in and out of the painful conscious I now embody. ¬†I don't know who I am anymore. ¬†I'm not sure I know who we are anymore. ¬†My marriage is on the rocks. ¬†My final dream has crashed down before my very eyes like a nightmare made of glass come true. ¬†I am forced to live each moment at a time. ¬†I can't look too far into the future anymore without feeling an impending, omnipresent dread. ¬†Sleep deprivation and nicotine have kept my conscience clear. ¬†But I know I cannot lose the woman I love so much.

For anyone out there who has ever gone through something like this... please... what the fuck am I supposed to do? ¬†I feel like I have two guns pointed at my head instead of just one. ¬†I am already in therapy, and so is she. ¬†It sounds clich√©, but I think I probably am suffering from an existential crisis, and some days, I just can't see through it. ¬†Help me, please.",1712194589.0,

thekookypal,Therapy options for marriage plus ADHD,1,1bvq908,0,"Hi all. I‚Äôm looking for help. My husband was diagnosed with ADHD last year. I had suspected for a while and researched quite a bit about symptoms/behaviors. He was really struggling and so I sent him some of my research and suggested he get evaluated, which he did and then was diagnosed. He has also always struggled with depression and anxiety. 

He got on medication and has reported it has helped him tremendously at work. 

So now I need help. We have a daughter and are expecting our second in about 5 months. Before kids, I was able to compensate for a lot of his ADHD type behaviors (inability to manage time, object permanence, general executive functioning). I also feel like his behaviors have gotten worse/more exaggerated after kids (which also happened to coincide with COVID and more phone use). 

With kids, it is too much for me to do by myself and continue to compensate for him. I feel like sometimes his inability to focus/organize results in dangerous situations for our daughter when I leave them alone and that we‚Äôve simply been lucky nothing has happened. I am terrified at the thought of ever leaving him alone with 2 small children, but I sometimes travel for work and it‚Äôs also just not fair that I shouldn‚Äôt ever be able to leave him alone. I know plenty of people successfully parent with ADHD. 

I am trying to find the best options for either some sort of adult behavioral therapy he can do or if there even exists a marriage counseling type situation where the counselor can address both our communication and tools for managing his ADHD at home. 

I just don‚Äôt know exactly where to start - are there key words I should be searching for? Should I just be searching for general therapist and then look to see if any of them specialize in adult ADHD? Would a therapist in this type of situation also work with me to understand how I can help/change the way I communicate to make him more successful? 

Anything else I should be considering? 

He is open to therapy. He has gone to therapy in the past just for generalized depression, before his ADHD diagnosis. He was the one that actually suggested marriage counseling last year, but beyond suggesting it he never actually booked anything for us. So now I‚Äôve decided to get it done and find a therapist/counselor.

sad-cloudz,Can you recover repressed memories?,4,1bvf1pi,0,"tldr; When I was 7, I asked a boy to tie me to the bed and tickle me. I want to know if I learned to do that because it may have been done to me by the man my mom cheated on my dad with. Can I somehow recover those memories if it was a traumatic experience that I had suppressed?   


When I (23f) was around 6 years old, my mom was having an affair while my dad was overseas (airforce). They worked it out and are still together to this day so all is well in the end. I remember a handful of interactions with this other man (call him M). I remember that he had a wife and daughter around my age. My mom would take my little brother and I to M's house while his family was away, I remember sleeping in his daughters bed overnight. A couple of key memories that I can recall:  


1. My brother and I were taking a bath and playing with bath toys at his house. I don't think I was very comfortable with the man because he came into the bathroom to check on us or hang out with us, I'm not sure, and I remember feeling weird about him being there. 
2. I once left his house with this cute anime girl card collection (pretty sure they were his daughters) and I was so obsessed with them on the ride back to my house and they disappeared after that. Makes sense now why they disappeared.
3. My dad packing his stuff and leaving while my mom begged him to stay. I just remember crying in their bed scared, I was resentful towards my dad for leaving us because I didn't know what was going on. He came back the next night.
4. M gave me a hardshell princess backpack for my birthday that I opened at my 7th birthday party and my dad snatched that shit out of my hands and threw it in the trash. Once again, resentful because I didn't know why. 

When I was about 19 I ended up mentioning to my dad that I remember. My mom still doesn't know that I remember. My dad ended up telling me that he put a key logger on our computer and that is how he found out my mom was cheating. She would talk to him in Tagalog (my moms language) so my dad had to show it to his Filipino friends to get it translated. She would refer to him as the equivalent to her ""master."" Shit was sad but I'm glad he could finally confide in me about it because I have always felt so sorry for him growing up. He also mentioned that my mom actively tried to turn my brother and I against my dad. But with him constantly being deployed there's no way that would've worked, he was my bff who I never got to see so of course I idolized him and wanted nothing more than his presence in the end.  


Now to get into my actual question: can you recover repressed memories? I always credit certain sexual fantasies to a situation that went down at my 7th birthday party (also, it just now occurred to me that my dad tossing my backpack and this little incident happened on the same day). I was in my little princess dress and remember crushing on this 12 year old. I went into my room with the lights off and he followed me in. I told him to tie my hands to the bed (they weren't really tied, I don't remember what we used but it was loosely wrapped) and to tickle me. It was really innocent at the time but now I look back at it like, I had to have learned that from someone??? A part of me wants to think I walked in on my parents doin kinky shit and I thought my dad was tickling my mom??? Or... if it had been done to me by M. That's my biggest concern. I don't even know how to begin to figure out the roots of that little incident but it hasn't been sitting right with me lately.   


Could I have just simply come up with that idea on my own? Are kinks a learned behavior or are they something we are kind of ""born"" with? Is it possible that I was sexually assaulted as a child and I just can't remember?  


And yes, I do still love my mother but we didn't have the best relationship growing up and I credit that to my resentment towards her cheating. We'll never be close and she was never a loving mother but she provided what I needed to survive and things have been better since I've been out of the house. I will never shake the feeling that my dad deserves better, he is my best friend and sometimes I wish he didn't have to put up with her toxic ass for so many years. But I know he loves her and he just wants things to work out and I respect that. ",1712207460.0,

Then she had a pretty long talk about how I always avoid her and any discussion of feelings so she couldn't really have known.

There‚Äôs a small part of me that wants to connect to my younger curious self, but the fears are hardwired into me. 
Advice? How to not let trauma dictate my desire to learn, to grow? I always have the fear that it‚Äôs too late, and that I‚Äôve been left behind. I don‚Äôt know as much as my peers anymore, which wasn‚Äôt ever an issue, until I became insecure about feeling too stupid to have curiosity in the first place.

orneeee_,Does therapy actually work?,8,1bv4ate,10,"Listen, I'm a teenage girl and almost all of my friends go to therapy. In my main group of highschool we are five and I'm the only one that doesn't go to therapy.

Sometimes, when I open up to my friends about some of my issues and problems at home, they all listen carefully and are very understanding, but they end every sentence with 'you should go to therapy'.

It makes me kinda mad ngl, but I'll never say it to their faces, I just nod and say 'yeah, sure'
The reason why I don't think therapy is that important is because all of them go, but all of them seem to... not really get betterr? One of them actually try to commit s*icide last year (she's all right now, thank god) but she had both a therapist and a physiatrist, plus medication, for a while.
My other friend has been going for almost a year now, and although I'm not the one to judge her improvement, she definitely still the same girl, with the same mental issues, making the same mistakes, etc.
Lastly, my third friend doesn't really respond to her therapist messages, said at some point she was gonna drop therapy and then two weeks later had a session. It just seems very unstable.

I understand everyone is different. I'm not hating on my friends because I love them and I also have problems  (like any other person tbh) but I really don't like when they recommend me to go to therapy because it doesn't seem like it help them a lot either, it seems that they just say it to remember me they all go to a professional and not me, like it's helping them when in reality they still make su*cidal comments sometimes and still make the same mistakes. Like, what is therapy helping you with exactly??? talking to somebody?? I'm perfectly fine talking to my friends and my family sometimes, I don't see the reason why I should pay to talk to someone that's actually not going to help me.

Again, I'm not hating on my friends, not am I saying I'm better than them or anything like that, I just really don't think therapy is helping them as they say it is. They all act the same as they did even before therapy.

Idk, I'm sure therapy is good but it doesn't convince me. I wanna hear stories of therapy actually helping people so I can get another vision and expand my opinion on the matter.",1712178391.0,

DiscountEmergency635,Spirituality as psychiatry and cultivating the gifts the universe gives you. ,1,1bveawb,0,"Spirituality as psychiatry and cultivating the gifts the universe gives you. 

We have an idea of ‚Äústability‚Äù in ‚Äúsociety‚Äù as a picture of mental health. This stability is defined as uniformity and perfection. Perhaps order should be defined by harmony. We are imperfect beings in an imperfect world. What if I were to suggest a fluid mind is a healthy mind. 

From birth we in the western world are indoctrinated in to a way of life that worships abundance and feints scarcity. This philosophy is unharmonic with our nature, and in following it, society has lost its conscious contact with the all encompassing energy of the universe.

This has created a society of spiritually sick people. For most people this sickness only manifest itself in minor ways that society sees no issue with, but in people diagnosed with mental ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù this sickness has earth shattering consequence. 

So what do we do? 

My goal is to reform religion and what that means in the context of humanity. Removing all ancient egos/traumas in search of the truth about the universal energy that unites us all. Enabling us to properly use spirituality as psychiatry and fully unlock the potential power of the human mind.

Shes known to be a big personality, and sometimes a lot to deal with.  To preface, she did not have any friends during high school, was actively hated on/bullied in high school, we are her first real friends, and she doesn‚Äôt pick up social cues AT ALL (she thinks shes on the spectrum, but i think she just is narcissistic) (i say that because she was tested twice and both came negative, she is gonna get tested again. either way she‚Äôs narcissistic for other reasons lol).  Our friend group has become accustomed to this and gets it. We had some bumps in the beginning of the year, but it‚Äôs been fine since then.

Until after spring break. 

My close friends, 19M and 19M, are over a lot. They both had a romantic things with girls our first semester, but now are just single and not looking for anything. My roommate, first semester, would try and cuddle them while we watched movies on our TV and this would make the two boys very uncomfortable. They don‚Äôt feel that way about her, and actively try and scoot away when she makes advances on them. I confronted her about this last semester and she claimed it she felt it was normal because there were girls that did do that with them (that being cuddle, girls being the people they were interested in atm). I told her that the relationship was a lot different, and just because someone does it with someone else doesnt mean they want to do it with everyone. She didn‚Äôt love my answer, and seemed to take it personally and got a little upset. BUT she did stop her actions, and the dynamic with the boys became a lot better. 

We thought we were over this, but after spring break her behavior started again. 
Shes not trying to kiss them or anything, but will place her hand on their thigh, put her butt uncomfortably and obviously close to them, and will just attempt to be as physically close to them as possible. Yes, obviously they‚Äôve said something to her about this. They are both a little soft spoken and generally try to avoid confrontation, but after me confronting her once they thought it‚Äôs be fine to mention it again (in case she forgot). When one if them did mention it to her, she got all mad claiming that they didn‚Äôt like her and think shes disgusting. They don‚Äôt want to confront her again because they claim she‚Äôll just have the same reaction again. My friend old me that if it happened again he was worried he was gonna have a panic attack. They both avoid her, and be kinda snappy to her now. 

Shes finally catching on that they have an issue with her. She just claims they‚Äôre being sassy with her and annoying. Instead of asking whats wrong she just becomes very sassy with them at all times. 

I don‚Äôt want my friends to be uncomfortable with her and I don‚Äôt want to lie to her about not knowing. What shes doing is really messed up, and the same thing happened to her and she called it assault.

hungrylikethewolf4,Was my experience normal? Should I get a new therapist?,0,1bv6t7s,0,"I have had 11-13 sessions so far with my therapist from betterhelp. Today I had a session. My therapist always saids hello and ask ""how are you?"" and so I answered ""I am fine/okay/neutral"". I told her I am hesitant on saying I am well even though today up until that point was going well. She said it helps to cheer on the little daily things, even if they feel unimportant, because it gives you motivation for the next thing. I said I understood how that could help but I struggle to do that because for the last 2 years I have cheered on mediocre things and then I find myself 2 years later wondering why my life is mediocre and why I have felt so unfulfilled. So now I have a harder time cheering on daily things because I don't want to settle for things like I usually have done. I gave an example on how in the past, i'd say I am having a good day and let it get to my head and then kinda relax and not do anything else for the rest of the day. Versus what I do now is remind myself the day isn't over yet until the end so I don't just get carried away by the label I give the day, half way through the day.  


My therapist then gave an analogy of a good and bad teacher. That a good teacher can be one that is demanding of you but it motivates you to be a better student and a bad teacher can be someone that makes you feel bad about not doing enough. She told me to try to be like the good teacher. She asked me if I understood the analogy. And I explained to her that logically I did, but I also told her that that good teacher in her analogy would probably have the opposite effect on me, that I'd feel crushed by the weight of their expectations and my perfectionism would kick in and I'd be stressed doing work/studying. And that obviously the bad teacher would make me feel guilty in the analogy.  


So she told me she wants me to think about what kind of teacher would motivate me and then extract the information and figure out how I can be that person for myself. I told her I'd give it some thoughts. She said something that made me think that it might be something she wanted us to talk about in the very same session since we were only 20 mins out of the 45 mins into our session. But she said ""no its for hw, i am going to give you time and ill be here if you need me"" and since it was only 20 mins in the session, I was thinking she meant while on our call, there will be silence while i think and she gives me the time, and that we would talk about it since she would be there for me since our session wasn't over. However, I was wrong. She said ""okay thanks"" and I said ""okay"" while waiting for more talk and then she said ""okay, bye"" and I saw that our session ended.  


I spent 20 mins trying to gather my thoughts/feelings/courage to message her expressing how confused I was left and shocked that our session ended so early and that I misunderstood her and thought it was something we'd do in our session since we were only almost half way through. I also expressed I actually had things to ask/talk about with her. She messaged me back within half an hour, but by then I was too emotional to talk. I was emotional because I had a conversation with a loved one and they suggested that I didn't do my part in the session and that i might have some fault in it, that upset me a lot plus feeling very uncomfortable engaging in further conversation with my therapist.... I haven't responded since (its been 2 hours).

At first I was in it for a few years straight and the last seven years it has been on and off.

I had a two year stint between 2021- early 2023. I started to feel like I no longer needed it and used to be happy when my therapist would take a week off. I decided to stop for this reason, asking to go down to once every 4-5 weeks.

My God I was no prepared for what happened next. Within a few weeks I started to really struggle with my anxiety and self regulation. Within about six months I signed up to a short course of free CBT via the NHS through what is called ‚Äòguided self help‚Äô. It did very little for me.

I reached out to my therapist and asked if we could start again, and within a few months we did.

I‚Äôm now three months in and the difference to my life is noticeable. Friends and colleagues commented within the first month that I seemed to be a lot more settled - despite them not even knowing. I feel as well that I‚Äôm doing some particularly good work because of the time I had away from therapy.

However - even though I‚Äôm on a reduced fee, it‚Äôs still not cheap. I would really like to get to a stage where I‚Äôm not giving away 300¬£ a month on therapy. However, I don‚Äôt want to do that at the expense of my sanity.",1712127183.0,
GroundbreakingBet154,Words I wish my dad would understand.,1,1buvfii,0,"You don't  get my feelings, no matter how many times you say you do. Divorcing mom doesn't help heal the family, and you didn't protect us from any hurt as you said.

Maybe the wound is too new.  I remember telling you I can forgive you for \*so many things\* but, I can never forgive you for walking out on us. And the whole process of you walking out on us took less than a week. Unbelievable. How is that preventing us from pain, when we never had time to talk about it? I brought up speaking about it.

Mom and I begged you to stay, but you left. How do you think that makes us feel. I haven't even gotten to the juicy part.

I don't doubt that you are hurting. You never see me, your son, you only text me once in a while. But its almost like you left and you don't care. It breaks my heart.

I haven't even mentioned once what makes you the maddest. The sole fact that you cheated. And that it has happened twice. I told you it is repeated behavior, but you said repeated behavior is ""everyday or every month, not two times in your life"". How does that make me and mom feel? I'll tell you: not good enough. Despite being the reason why you do the things you in your life dad, it still feels like I am not enough for you. You left. You cheated. You lied.

But somehow, when mom and I wanted to talk about you cheating, it was always ""why are you ganging up on me"" and ""I can't stand being the bad guy any more"". What a meaningless excuse. It hurts.

He's 30 now and still lives with me and my parents. He was mobbed in school and didn't get over it in spite of getting therapy over multiple years (he's still in). He is unhappy with his life (his job or lack thereof, his incapability to form meaningful friendships or relationships, the dating market, his choices, and the family). He only talks about his problems and wines every day about how hard it is for him and how society failed him and such. We support him very much and try to help, but apart from comforting him and giving advice every day there's not much we can do. Clearly he would need to move out but he's emotionally dependent on us.
 For years my mom and brother have been fighting regularly, and I as a 12 year old went between them often, because my dad wasn't always there. At first it was ok, but I got more and more stressed, so I opted out and let them do their thing. 
I have a certain pressure on my chest at night often and feel sad and don't get air so well. That has to do with other problems in my life I feel like, but today, after another fight, I got this feeling in the day and it struck me unprepared.

My problem is though, I have this belief that any therapist I go to will not truly care about me or my feelings or what I'm going through, instead caring more about the money I pay them to talk to me. I feel that if they don't care, I'm just wasting my time going to them and it isn't worth going at all.

So I‚Äôve found myself in counseling. I experienced a very traumatic event in my 20s and part of the way I had to cope was to separate my present self from the girl who was hurt. When I look back, maybe I‚Äôve convinced myself we really are not the same even though I know it was me, I can‚Äôt put myself there. I refer to that person as ‚Äòthat girl‚Äô or ‚Äòher‚Äô. I feel like I could work through the trauma safely without needing to connect it to me. 

Of course the therapist says that my past, present and future self are all me and that I shouldn‚Äôt refer to ‚Äúher‚Äù. Even though she understands why I‚Äôve done that. 

I feel like if I can read about it, then maybe I can process or accept that it‚Äôs something I shouldn‚Äôt do. If there is a name for it. The only thing I could find was Multiple personality and I definitely don‚Äôt have that!

I made it to where I am today because I left that girl behind. So being told that my current anxiety and depression is due to unresolved trauma is very upsetting because it‚Äôs something I never ever want to revisit or deal with. If I have too, I prefer to talk about her. What happened to her. Closure for her. Not me because I currently am not suffering.

Initially he became really nice and was like it‚Äôs ok i can understand and u are a virgin id wanna take that burden and we can be just friends and me being dumb felt guilty and continued talking to jim ‚Äúas a friend‚Äù but he never stopped he would get really disgusting with extreme fetishes and alot of times i would end the call on his face, i told him that i really don‚Äôt wanna be rude and idk why but he was really good at guilt tripping me bcz everytime i would be like this is it he would become really nice and apologise anf make me feel bad. 

He had pure hatred for women he wanted to
Abuse me he said everytime i say no to him it makes him more horny and he wants to hurt me and i should be a good submissive girl and multiple times i tried to run from him but he told me a sob story about how women have been bad to him and he was emotionally abused by them and he is lonely and he feels connected to me and telling me that if i leave he will kill himself, that he is crazy.

I was in a very weird situation, finally i was like this is getting too much bcz every insecurity every painful thing i shared witj him he used to use that thing to degrade me when he use to get horny (my grandfather‚Äôs death, my medical condition, me being a virgin and wanting to not sleep witj men bcz of my trauma (I wasn‚Äôt raped but close enough for alot of developmental yesrs of my life by multiple men and women) i told him that i‚Äôm scared of sex and want my first time to be with my husband bcz I don‚Äôt wanna risk getting traumatised by penetrative sex aswell.and i sttill tried to be nice and be like i‚Äôm not over my ex (thought that would be a red flag for him)

He would always act compasionate but as soon as he would get horny he would talk about forcing himself on me and shoving the pointed end of heels in my ass and alot more abusive stuff like making sure I don‚Äôt breath.

Honestly i was numb, i felt trapped, i was scared, i said no as much as i could and i cried multiple times infront of him to leave me alon, then one day i got the courage and i tolf him that I don‚Äôt care and i‚Äôm not going to give him an ounce of attention and if he wants to stay he can as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù which i was sure he would never and i stopped all communication witj him‚Ä¶he tried to emotionally blackmail me he tried to make me feel bad for him but i was done and severely depressed ‚Ä¶ after cutting off all contact he came back saying that i make him horny that thoughts of me don‚Äôt leave his mind and i gave no response to him.

Teal_tree42,"I am trauma bonded and I love/hate it.....no i hate it.....only love it a little....no, all hate......only sometimes a little bit of love",2,1buj1gm,1,"I have been drawn to you since page 1. Let's be real, the book couldn't even start without you, you are page 1. Your charm, your sincerity, your honesty, your good looks. You make me feel alive. A part of me that is. You make a part of me feel so, so alive. This part gravitates to you, day in and day out. This part dances with insomnia to the tune of you. This part is always reaching for you..... but you know how to stay just out of reach. You let me get close enough to smell your aftershave, close enough to graze your soft grey tee with my fingertips, close enough to feel your warm breath caress my neck, but far enough away to constantly crave your presence. Just the thought of you is enough to make me stumble.  
 Our deep, careful conversations left me thirsty for a year. Your absence left me to ponder what could have been. Are you the one? Is this fate?  
I reached out after a year of no contact for clarity, at least that is what I tell myself. The truth? I'd pay you to live in my mind. You're familiar and comforting yet unknown and exciting. I can't resist you anymore.   
You give me that intoxicating, present, careful attention for an hour, then I watch as it dilutes over the week until all I am left with is the daydreams of your presence and the haunting of your absence. When I least expect it, I get my fix and I drop everything to suck every ounce out of that high, neglecting myself and my other relationships.  
I know what this is. I have known all along, but the highs have been too high, why ruin that with the truth? But it's time.   
You remind me of my father. A man who made sure to leave me deprived of his love, affection, and connection. He was frugal with his approval but made sure I never forgot the taste. The momentary praise, support, and attention left me itching for more. I would desperately reach for his approval, only to run hopelessly into his cold, dry, wall. I'd be left with the wound of his absence that lingered for weeks, months, or even years. Aching with his disdain, his neglect, his discontentment. Despite this wound I would chase him religiously, displaying perfectionism, people pleasing, and complete submission, not realizing the more I chased him, the farther I got from myself.    
So, this isn't love. This isn't butterflies. This isn't even a crush. This is a cry for help. A cry for help from a part of me that was continually denied consistency and effort when she needed it most. A part of me that is reaching for you in an attempt to recreate this relationship and ""make it right"". In an effort to write a different ending. An effort to finally ""heal"" and end the story.   
 I revisit my child self and I can see it clearly now. Everything. Consistency and effort are two things I have neglected myself over the last year. This past year has provided a new meaning to inconsistent and in the face of so much uncertainty, I have been fearful of putting in effort, in all areas of my life.   
So that part of me that craves you so, so bad, is actually just crying out for help. Crying for the consistency and effort that she has been denied for so long. ONLY I have the power to provide that, and ONLY I can rewrite this story.    
This book may have started with you, but it can only end with me.",1712116377.0,
Ok-Gain-3486,When is it too late to undo the damage done to a child due to neglectful parents?,4,1bugymh,2,"Ok. So my parents have been super neglectful towards their children, including me. 

My father had been absent (due to work or otherwise general absence) and didn‚Äôt have much role to play in my life. 

My mother was super abusive towards me. She used to secretly beat me as a form of punishment, verbally abuse me. This pattern continued up until I was in my 20s. But she stopped hitting and all coz I once physically retaliated. Now up in my 30s whenever we are together, I‚Äôve come to realize that she also has a habit of purposely do things, behave in a way and ignore my requests to irk me. 

Since I get triggered easily and get mad at her because of her repeatedly doing what she does, she uses that to villainize me in front of those who are present in the room (including my dad) 

My dad is aloof so he doesn‚Äôt form opinions of his own. He‚Äôd believe whatever is told to him. So you all can guess what he thinks of me. His philosophy had been to ignore everything and turn a blind eye until he sees me lashing out on my mother, because as their child I shouldn‚Äôt be doing that with my mother. 

Alright back to my mother, she never believes her kids. Once there was a woman, house help, who was stealing from our house (she emptied out almost everything) and when I brought it up and asked my parents to fire her, I was thrown out of the house instead. 

Anyway, so now I have a brother who very very young. He‚Äôs just 10. I had been taken care of him since he was born but I had to leave the house when he was 4-5 for work and leave him with my parents responsible for him. 

He was a very curious child with proper social skills and I made sure that I didn‚Äôt repeat my parents pattern and was more like a free range parent. 

I had also raised my sister and I‚Äôd say I got lucky coz she turned out amazing and capable of making the right decisions in life and reading people correctly to save herself from any problems. 

Because I was thrown out of the house, I was forced to yet again leave my brother in the care of my mother. I‚Äôve come back to live with them for a few days and I see her neglectful patterns continuing. I can also notice the negative impact on my mother because of this. His social skills are not as good as they were when was younger, he has cognition problem (he was very good at studies and now his grades are going down), there is no curfew for him. When I complain about this or highlight where they are lacking, my mother dismisses me on the ground that I‚Äôm always stirring drama. My dad still ignoring everything. 

I‚Äôm not successful in my life and I see how my mother‚Äôs role in my life impacted me and left me as a wasted potential. Although I am trying my best to settle in life asap. 

My sister is still doing better than me but not as well she can. 

Now my question is if I take my brother in at the age of 12 or 14 can I undo all this damage from then on? Or will it be too late? 

There are a lot of other things that my mother does like having affairs and what not but I guess that‚Äôs not very important to elaborate here. 

Edit: I made sure that I don‚Äôt let my siblings be beaten my mother or even verbally abused. So that‚Äôs a positive sign.

helianthus_0,How do I trust a new therapist after losing four of them? ,1,1buk3rb,1,"Hi. I‚Äôll try to make this brief. 

I‚Äôve been in therapy, off and on, for 14 years. I struggle with eating disorders, depression, autism and dermatillomania. 

I‚Äôve had several individual therapists, either outpatient or while in an ED treatment program. 4 I had to drop for insurance reasons or because I discharged from ED program and couldn‚Äôt see them outpatient, one wasn‚Äôt a right fit so I moved on and 4 left for various reasons. I‚Äôve also had multiple outpatient group therapists leave because they got new jobs, moved or as one put it ‚Äújust don‚Äôt feel like doing this anymore.‚Äù

My second time in ED treatment, I was put with therapist P, who left the facility half way through my stay and I was placed with another therapist there. Not a big deal, as this therapist knew all about me from treatment team meetings and group sessions. 

My third time in treatment, I was placed with therapist N, who also left halfway through that stay because she got another job, and a promotion, at another facility. I was happy for her and again, not a big deal for the aforementioned reason. 

Then I was seeing J outpatient. He left the therapy group he was with to take a corporate job and was no longer seeing patients. I was oddly resigned, neither happy nor sad. 

A few years later, I was seeing S outpatient, a therapist connected with a treatment center. I was working really hard with her to recover from an anorexia relapse and avoid another stay in a treatment program. Then she announces she‚Äôs quitting to do private practice, won‚Äôt take my insurance and even if she did, she‚Äôs at least a 45 minute drive, one way. 

I was pissed and so hurt. How dare she leave me when I needed her! It‚Äôs like I finally realized the time and incredible emotional toll it takes to unpack all of my history, my complex relationship with my mom, how my brain works, all of that. And I‚Äôd have to do it all over again! I sat in her office and cried and yelled, suddenly so angry at her, at my other therapists for leaving, at myself, at the damn world. 

That was three years ago. I still have issues, unresolved mental health crap and I‚Äôve known for a long time that I should be in therapy. But I don‚Äôt know how to trust another therapist to stick around for longer than 3-4 months. If I start seeing someone, I feel like I have to decide wether to keep them at arms length, don‚Äôt go through the emotional labor of revealing a lot because they‚Äôll just leave (then why go to therapy at all?), or talk my ass off, reveal as much as I can in as little time as possible, so I can get as much out of therapy as I can before they inevitably leave.

Cubzlee,T-Rex arms 100% Nerodivergent or everyone? And is masking conscious?,0,1bujigk,0,"I've been doing T-Rex arms since I can remember and I thought I had kicked the habit, but recently I've noticed that I do it a lot again. And I really want to know if it's something that nerotypical people do subconsciously as well, but I'm having a really hard time finding information. 

It's also unclear to me if masking is something that people who are diagnosed with autism/adhd do consciously or subconsciously? Because if it's subconscious and I have autism/adhd then it would mean that the frequency of my t-rex arms has not increased because of stress, but that my noticing that I'm doing it and getting uncomfortable with it is increasing (because of stress/lack of energy). As in if I were to be overworking myself would that then make it harder for me to mask subconsciously?

It's really important to me because I don't have to confidence yet to find a therapist and go long enough to find out if I have autism/adhd or not. I often feel like it won't matter if I get a diagnosis because I don't know what I would even do with that information, so I just don't.

Lost_Throwaway5334,My therapist told me I‚Äôm mean to my husband for wanting to rather be left alone during panic attacks than accept his help,7,1bu074w,3,"Not sure what I want from posting this, I just feel so defeated and worthless. 

I‚Äôve been struggling with PPD, anxiety and self worth issues for a year now, and I‚Äôm in therapy. My husband went with me for one of the sessions.

I felt that he was scared during one of my panic attacks, and I feel like I talk very harshly to him during those, and he feels helpless, and doesn‚Äôt know what to do or how to help me. I don‚Äôt either, and when he asks me (during the attack) I get frustrated and tell him to please leave me alone or do something else rather than help - as I‚Äôm too anxious to be able to explain to him what he could do. I‚Äôd ask him to google it, and he‚Äôd tell me he‚Äôd rather hear from me what I need in the moment. This is why I brought him with me, to help clarify for myself and for him what he could do during those events.

Thing is, I don‚Äôt know what he should do that would help me, and if I knew what would help, I‚Äôd probably do it myself? I‚Äôve asked him to just listen to me without trying to problem solve, but he says he just can‚Äôt do that, and has to ‚Äúactively fix it, or not help at all.‚Äù

When we were at our joint session, I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do when all he does it ask me questions and demands answers while I‚Äôm hyperventilating, I‚Äôm not an expert on this and can‚Äôt help him and myself at the same time‚Äù 

My therapist went over this with me, and told me that it was a very mean thing to say, and that anyone offering help should be accommodated and welcomed, even if they‚Äôre not doing it right, because the attempt alone is better than being ignored while in pain. She went further with it, and asked me how I feel about being such a mean person, and whether or not I feel like he deserves better, and I agreed with her, both that I‚Äôm a bad person and that my husband deserves better.

I think that me struggling with how generally ashamed I am of myself, and my self worth issues, make it a very difficult situation, because she just confirmed that I‚Äôm as mean as I‚Äôm afraid I am. She did ask me if I thought the feedback was too harsh, to which I lied and said it wasn‚Äôt, and that she doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a bad person overall. 

So what am I supposed to do now? I‚Äôm already so quiet and avoidant and such a people pleaser that I feel like breaking at the possibility of disappointing people, so how am I supposed to talk to him during these panic attacks? He won‚Äôt let me be alone either, and will literally break down the door if I‚Äôve locked myself away to have a panic attack alone. ",1712068267.0,
Ok-Gain-3486,When is it too late to undo the damage done to a child due to neglectful parenting?,1,1buefy8,0,"Ok. So my parents have been super neglectful towards their children, including me. 

My father had been absent (due to work or otherwise general absence) and didn‚Äôt have much role to play in my life. 

My mother was super abusive towards me. She used to secretly beat me as a form of punishment, verbally abuse me. This pattern continued up until I was in my 20s. But she stopped hitting and all coz I once physically retaliated. Now up in my 30s whenever we are together, I‚Äôve come to realize that she also has a habit of purposely do things, behave in a matter of and ignore my requests to irk me. 

Since I get triggered easily and get mad at her because of her repeatedly doing what she does, she uses that to villainize me in front of those who are present in the room (including my dad) 

My dad is aloof so he doesn‚Äôt form opinions of his own. He‚Äôd believe whatever is told to him. So you all can guess what he thinks of me. His philosophy had been to ignore everything and turn a blind eye until he sees me lashing out on my mother, because as their child I shouldn‚Äôt be doing that with my mother. 

Alright back to my mother, she never believes her kids. Once there was a woman, house help, who was stealing from our house (she emptied out almost everything) and when I brought it up and asked my parents to fire her, I was thrown out of the house instead. 

Anyway, so now I have a brother who very very young. He‚Äôs just 10. I had been taken care of him since he was born but I had to leave the house when he was 4-5 for work and leave him with my parents responsible for him. 

He was a very curious child with proper social skills and I made sure that I didn‚Äôt repeat my parents pattern and was more like a free range parent. 

I had also raised my sister and I‚Äôd say I got lucky coz she turned out amazing and capable of making the right decisions in life and reading people correctly to save herself from any problems. 

Because I was thrown out of the house, I was forced to yet again leave my brother in the care of my mother. I‚Äôve come back to live with them for a few days and I see her neglectful patterns continuing. I can also notice the negative impact on my mother because of this. His social skills are not as good as they were when was younger, he has cognition problem (he was very good at studies and now his grades are going down), there is no curfew for him. When I complain about this or highlight where they are lacking, my mother dismisses me on the ground that I‚Äôm always stirring drama. My dad still ignoring everything. 

I‚Äôm not successful in my life and I see how my mother‚Äôs role in my life impacted me and left me as a wasted potential. Although I am trying my best to settle in life asap. 

My sister is still doing better than me but not as well she can. 

Now my question is if I take my brother in at the age of 12 or 14 can I undo all this damage from then on? Or will it be too late? 

There are a lot of other things that my mother does like having affairs and what not but I guess that‚Äôs not very important to elaborate here. 

Edit: I made sure that I don‚Äôt let my siblings be beaten my mother or even verbally abused. So that‚Äôs a positive sign. She has never abused my sister and I see her punishing my brother but only due to studies and that too to the minimum. But I haven‚Äôt been able to prevent her neglectful patterns beyond that.

asceticalstudy,does the gender of the therapist have any real effect?,4,1btyeix,21,"ok so some context, I know the title probably sounds really sexist.

I'm 17M and considering starting therapy due to some issues that I have personally not been able to resolve myself.

I have found that it's easier for me to talk to women about stuff like this than it is for me to talk to men, but there are some issues with me that I feel uncomfortable sharing with a woman and feel like a guy could understand better because it is something he would have in most probability experienced himself.

Is it wrong of me to think this way? does the gender of the therapist really matter, do male and female therapists operate differently or talk differently?

Essentially the crossroads I'm at is I either pick comfortability over a broad spectrum of topics but not be feel comfortable with some key specific topics, or that I be kind of uncomfortable with everything but be able to talk about everything.

I don't think therapy will work if I'm not completely forthcoming, but I'm scared enough as it is since this is my first time going, and the country I live in kind of stigmatizes getting mental help.

NotQuiteUncleIroh,"I (23m) kind of feel like an Uncle Iroh character to my girlfriend (21f), and it‚Äôs hard",2,1bu16i5,0,"I‚Äôll keep this relatively short because I don‚Äôt know how important many of the details are.

My girlfriend has been amazing to have by my side, we‚Äôre coming up on one year next week. But she‚Äôs been through a lot of trauma in her life (including csa, not from her parents), and her upbringing and relationship to her family has kind of piled on to her and it‚Äôs coming to a head now where she doesn‚Äôt know her identity.

When we first met and started talking, I learned that she can get triggered and endured some mild verbal abuse anytime I made her super anxious (maybe more than mild but I interpreted it mildly since I could tell that she didn‚Äôt mean everything). This still happens from time to time but one thing that I find myself very good at is perspective taking. I can tell she‚Äôs anxious and having a panic attack, and I just happen to be the person in the room. When she calms down we build the rapport back up quickly and things get better.

She feels that her family doesn‚Äôt love her. Having met both her biological parents and her step mom, I can say she comes from a broken home, but I also think that her parents try to love her but don‚Äôt know how. She‚Äôs told me I‚Äôm the first person to teach her unconditional love, and while at first she didn‚Äôt believe it existed, now she‚Äôs more agnostic about the subject. I suspect that her parents gave her similar treatment to how they were raised, and she‚Äôs trying to break the cycle but by doing so is deconstructing both her religious beliefs (which she‚Äôs actually done very well with) and her upbringing (which is much harder). I persistently remind her that it‚Äôs okay to be sad, that you don‚Äôt have to be ashamed of yourself, and that I will not give up on you. Frankly, I don‚Äôt know where the relationship will go, and that scares her. I don‚Äôt look very far into the future, but she needs to know that she will have a life. She‚Äôs told me that she never suspected she‚Äôd make it this far. She‚Äôs in college and I‚Äôm kind of the only home she has, but I still live with my parents because rent is expensive. 

If you‚Äôve seen the show (which we‚Äôve also been watching together), you might see a lot of zuko in her. And I feel like iroh. And I always get stuck because there‚Äôs stuff I know she needs to hear from a therapist, but not necessarily from me. I do my best but it‚Äôs very difficult. We both have asd although our forms express themselves outwardly very differently. 

The hardest is when we‚Äôre in public. Her mom taught her to always mask in front of other people, I‚Äôm one of the few people she doesn‚Äôt mask around. Now from my experience, I have not had problems with not masking in public, like it has brought me no harm. But to her the neutral is still a negative. Her mothers approval was always conditional, and sometimes conditional on something impossible. She‚Äôs trying to fight the feeling that people don‚Äôt like her, because she was raised to believe that pleasing the most people is what gives you honor and self worth. This is hardest with my extended family. She finds it strange that we all like each other as a default. My family treats her nicely, but sometimes people in my family are weird and socially awkward, she interprets that as disapproval of her even when I insist that it‚Äôs not the case, because in her family acting nice to each other is a way to pretend that you like people, it‚Äôs not usually genuine. 

The hard part now is that she has a $50 dollar copay for each therapy session with her insurance. She‚Äôs barely making anything right now with her college job, and the therapist she currently sees just doesn‚Äôt quite scratch the itch of one of her old therapists (this one has a practice but they don‚Äôt take insurance). I just feel like that puts a lot of pressure on me, because I have to be both a kind of mentor figure in addition to a boyfriend.


I realize that she‚Äôs still maturing (as am I) and I don‚Äôt want to act like I‚Äôm perfect. I do love her and want what is best for her, regardless of what happens relationship wise. It just kind of feels like I have to carry the emotional weight of two people on me and I don‚Äôt exactly know how to proceed. (I‚Äôm in the middle of switching therapists and i stop myself from talking to people I love about it because she‚Äôll be humiliated if she finds out I did, and I respect her privacy, even though I trust my loved ones enough to empathize with her.)",1712070733.0,
H0telTrivago,Anxiety Making Job Transition Extremely Difficult,1,1bu65ry,0,"I haven't worked for an employer for 4 years, I've been occasionally freelancing remotely and mostly working on private projects. The point is that I am NOT accustomed to working for someone else for 8 hours straight and 40 hours/week for months at a time. I will soon need to transition to a full time job at 40/week and am incredibly anxious about whether I can handle my anxiety. The 8 hour work days 40 hour/weeks that I consistently worked 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago are long past and so I am not conditioned for that anymore, especially a work day for someone else and not myself. Over the past 4 years there have been many days where I've worked 8-16 hours per day for 1-2 weeks at a time with little issue but again in those instances I had control over my schedule.   
  
My anxiety stems from not wanting to feel trapped if I suddenly begin experiencing an anxiety attack. When that happens I need to stop and be alone for 5-10 minutes and I can process it and it will pass, but if I am amongst people the anxiety attack will continue and grow in intensity. I have emetophobia and that is the root of nearly all of the anxiety. So, when I experience any anxiety or an anxiety attack I will begin to feel nauseous and when that happens I worry even more because of the emetophobia and then it turns into a vicious cycle that feeds itself. 

I think I need a position where I have autonomy and control of my independence. For example, ironically, I could handle managing a store or a team especially if I had a private office, but honestly do not think I could handle running a cash register for 8 hours straight. 

Looking for ideas and solutions to help the transition. Ideally working part-time/full time in a remote capacity would be the best transition to gradually rebuilding my conditioning, and I could move on from there to in person.

ghostofflorida,How to seek affordable therapy ,1,1bty2s3,2,"I‚Äôm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I live in Ontario where OHIP is a thing but mental health is very much a grey area. If anyone knows what it‚Äôs like to be depressed, then they know just how hard it can be to search for help.

I need help knowing how to find something affordable but obviously effective. There‚Äôs a lot of emotional damage from over the years, and for the most part I was doing okay. I think I‚Äôve just reached that point where my coping mechanisms are not enough and my subconscious is eating away at me. I‚Äôm currently in university, and right now I can feel myself giving up.

Subject_Permission,"I‚Äôm (31F) really struggling with how perfect boyfriend‚Äôs (34M) ex girlfriend is, and the reason they broke up. Worried I‚Äôll self-sabotage this ",12,1bta8wh,10,"

I‚Äôve been with someone for about 7 months now and he‚Äôs wonderful, we get on well but I can‚Äôt shake the shadow his ex girlfriend casts over me. 

Before anyone suggests, yes I have insecurities issues, yes I am in therapy for it. I do not blame my boyfriend at all, these issues are entirely my own. But it doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt still difficult to deal with.

My boyfriend speaks very respectfully of all of his ex‚Äôs and just women in general, and I‚Äôve seen that as a big green flag. However, when we first started getting to know each other, a few months prior to dating, he told me about his ex after a few drinks at a party. In his own words, she is an incredible woman, intelligent, successful, beautiful and confident. She is also absolutely stunning, Victoria secret model body, naturally tiny and gorgeous. 

But alongside the characteristics and appearance, they also shared a very deep sexual and intellectual bond (again, his words) and were madly in love with each other. He told me that he‚Äôd never connected with anyone else on that level before, and what they had was very special.

I‚Äôll add he wasn‚Äôt still in love with her, they had broken up 2 years prior to us meeting, and he‚Äôd had flings with other people since. She only came up in conversation at a party because we were talking about mutual friends we have - his ex is a friend of one of my friends). 

We then went on our first date together a few months after this conversation and hit it off, but it‚Äôs always been in the back of my mind. I think he probably regrets telling me how wonderful she is, because he‚Äôs since learnt I struggle with my self esteem. I‚Äôve held back with him in ways I haven‚Äôt in previous relationships, especially during sex. 

A lot of people are inclined to say things like ‚Äòbut he chose you, not her‚Äô or ‚Äòthere‚Äôs a reason they aren‚Äôt together‚Äô but it‚Äôs not quite as cut and dry as that. He doesn‚Äôt want children (I don‚Äôt either) and his ex does. They didn‚Äôt split up because they grew out of love, or clashed with each other, or no longer had things in common. They didn‚Äôt hurt each other. He ended it because he didn‚Äôt want her to miss out on her dream of having a family, she knew it was the right thing to do, and they parted ways amicably. So the only reason he‚Äôs not with her is because she wants children, it doesn‚Äôt exactly make me feel any better or her shoes any smaller to fill. 

Like I said above, I know these are my own insecurities that I need to work through but it really is eating away at me, especially as I‚Äôm starting to fall for him deeply. But in the back of my mind, I can‚Äôt help but feel completely inferior to everything she was and what they had. We get on really well, there‚Äôs a connection, but is it as deep as theirs? Do we click on levels he hasn‚Äôt with anyone else? Is the fact I‚Äôm childfree the only thing that makes me stand out over her, whilst she is prettier, more successful, more intelligent than I? This is what is going through my mind :(

I get that it‚Äôs important to remember that someone is with me, but it still hurts to consider that even when that‚Äôs the case, the relationship and myself will never measure up. I just don‚Äôt know how to reconcile this in my mind and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to self sabotage this.

I haven‚Äôt brought it up because I just feel like it will sound pathetic, and it also isn‚Äôt his fault at all, so he doesn‚Äôt have to, and i wouldn‚Äôt expect him to deal with the issues that have manifested in my mind. 

TL;DR - feeling insecure and triggered by boyfriend‚Äôs perfect ex and the circumstance in which they broke up, struggling to reconcile it in my mind. ",1711993379.0,

We had several joint sessions and a few one on ones. I  think the therapist does not have an accurate read on the situation, so the advice feels more frustrating than helpful. I also feel like the therapist has given me conflicting advice at one point I was told I'm enabling bad behavior in the other person by trying to keep the peace and caving to what the family member wants. Now when I didn't cave to something I'm being told I should be kinder or even apologize because the family member wants me to even though I didn't do anything wrong.

So my question is when do I trust myself vs when do I listen to the therapist? I think the most recent advice is like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound, which just ignores the real problem. However, I'm very much a follow the rules type of person, so the idea of saying a professional is wrong and I am right isn't something I've been able to process very well, I keep doubting the whole situation.

Not sure where to start but I‚Äôm (F) in my 20s and I have a little sister who is a bit younger than me. Our parents got divorced around 11-13 years ago ( I can‚Äôt really remember rn).

I have almost no memories of my childhood. I‚Äôm not sure if my memory is correct, but in our old place the door to the room where my sister and I lived in had a hole ‚Äúput‚Äù in it. And I know for a fact that there was violence in the house, but don‚Äôt know if I or my kid sister got beaten (we did get spanked or hit with a belt etc, the minor stuff ig) I do remember a fight between our parents where he assaulted her and she fought back. 

Now, let‚Äôs talk about what I need help with. 
Facts are: my biological dad left us after the divorce, and the country later on. In the beginning he received visitation days and every 2nd weekend from the court to spend w us. As you might expect, he didn‚Äôt use it or when he did, he would ‚Äúallow‚Äù us to sleep in, to skip our hobbies and sports, sit in our phones the whole day or watch TV. When he left the country, we saw him every 2-3 years visiting him there and even then, we got shipped of to his mothers and spent alsmost every time all 3 weeks with our grandparents. He was visiting occasionally, since he is such a great father‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
More facts: he never payed child support. 
He never wanted to spent time without us because ‚Äúour mother would have time to herself and might go out with someone‚Äù

In the last couple of weeks and months I discovered some very very horrifying facts about him and the relationship our parents had. It goes from gaslighting our mom, manipulating her to stalking her even after (!!!!!) the divorce to physically assaulting her to breaking in her new place and to things where my fingers are shaking right now and I cannot type the rest of it

He returned back to our country kind of spontaneously and had been living here for almost 1 1/2 years.

Tomorrow we are meeting again (I don‚Äôt live in the same city as he does) 
I was thinking of not letting him know my cards (yet) and ask for his point of view. But honestly I‚Äôm scared and I‚Äôm not sure if I should take more time to think things through or if I should straight forward show him all my cards? 

What should I do and how could I maybe confront him or so? ",1711973526.0,

I don't want to harm myself I'm just exhausted and want to be better.
I say something they misunderstand and hours later strangers are showing up at my door and calling people that have no idea about anything related to this.

throw7847,What type of therapy would work for me!,2,1bspwb1,5,"I will try to keep this brief, I‚Äôm looking for a new therapist and I‚Äôm struggling to decide what therapy approach would work best for me to search for as I feel like I have a wide variety of issues I want to address. I‚Äôll list them:

1. Trauma from a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship from ages 15-17

2.  Some health anxiety, I believe starting from the loss of a friend due to cancer at age 6 (I say ‚Äúsome‚Äù because I‚Äôve done therapy for this specific issue and that helped a lot, but it still comes up every now and then)

3. Emotionally unavailable upbringing, leading to current issues with my parents and expressing emotions in general

4. Some really difficult friendship betrayals that I feel have hurt my ability to make and maintain friendships 

5. Pretty serious depression and anxiety

6. Almost positive I have ADHD (runs in the family, I have all the symptoms, etc)

Let me know if you have any ideas for a type of therapy that could help me address very specific issues without feeling like I can‚Äôt branch out to other topics. Thanks, and hope you‚Äôre all having a great night!

34 now, she‚Äôs spent a lot of her life taking care of her mom and siblings financially. Never lived her own life, even now a huge chunk of what she makes, at least a third to a half, she gives to them.
I know this is very common all around the globe. My curiosities are, about what kind of impact has this had on her development?
Whenever we talk about it, I think she gets very solemn thinking about the years she‚Äôs spent or lost taking care of them. But I‚Äôm not sure.

Sprout_Msp,I can't trust people or believe that they are actually being nice to me or supporting me,1,1bsov53,0,"I'm in 4th year /Year 12 /12th grade in Ireland and for the first 3 years of school I was very quiet and only talked to a small amount of people in my year, So since everyone else was so much more social and got on better with everyone, it seemed weird to them that I wasn't ,so they obviously thought I was weird and a  few people were bullying me a bit for it and nobody did anything to help and nobody understood why I might not talk so they found it funny aswell 

But I did have a few good friends however that I did feel comfortable with and I sent one of them a video of me messing about at a punching bag that included me farting towards the camera (as a joke ,it was not in any sort of weird way)
But that person sent it to another friend and he sent into a big group of people 
That I knew and another one of my friends showed it to loads of people in school (including the bullies) so that basically made everyone think I was double the amount of weird 
Then I argued with them about it and in the next few days we were in another group with another set of people from soccer and I asked who had seen it because I didn't want many people to have seen it and then the friend that sent it around sent it into that group aswell and I was already getting bullied at soccer aswell so it was the same story as school 

I'm still friends with those people because my area is so bad that there doesn't seem to be anyone else thats nicer than them somehow and there's 100% not anyone in my year 

However I know for a fact I am 100% normal compared to everyone else now and almost everyone SEEMS to be being nice to me to a certain extent but they could be still joking 
An example of this is that I've started making music and I released my 1st album recently and a good few people said it was good but a few if them were clearly joking so i don't know if most people are also joking just more subtly

And my friends are all bad friends aswell they're always making fun of me specifically and being pr¬°cks to me all the time 
They're such bad friends that I wasn't even comfortable dancing At our year's ball when they all were,So I stood beside them because I was to self conscious that they'd say something 

I wish I could have shortened all that down but this all seems significant to the story

Girlfriends complete switch up

I ‚ÄòM20‚Äô and my girlfriend ‚ÄòF19‚Äôhave been dating for almost 3 years. Our first year was amazing, we did everything together, never really fought, had great date nights, had a healthy sex life, anything you could have wanted. 

I‚Äôm very sorry for how this post is going to read as I‚Äôm just trying to get all of my thoughts out and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll make much sense. 

I paid for everything, as she didn‚Äôt want to work. (This is still true). I am comfortable with this. 

Whenever she is upset about something I listen comfort her, when I am upset about something I am told that it was actually my fault to begin with. 

Once year 2 came around she started complaining that we don‚Äôt do enough dates, yet when I asked her to do something she would always say no, or would that she‚Äôd rather stay home which was fine.


She also almost completely stopped wanting to have sex and said this was because she just didn‚Äôt really want too anymore. Sometimes, and I mean rarely, we will have sex every 3ish months, but I do all the work. This is not a lack of communication or lack of me trying to please her, as I go down on her literally every time we‚Äôve ever had sex (never reciprocated). We still kiss pretty consistently. 

She decided that she didn‚Äôt like to spend too much time together and felt that she needed more personal time, which I accepted and agreed too. 

Recently she‚Äôs been arguing with me over some of the most outlandish stuff, and I normally just give up and just say she was right and I was wrong. She also acts like it‚Äôs my fault that we are arguing and she rarely takes any accountability for her side. 

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I feel more like a guardian than a boyfriend, and I‚Äôm just very frustrated with how it‚Äôs all changed. I love her, and I can‚Äôt imagine life without her, and I always make sure to tell her that, but I‚Äôm so tired of feeling like this.

I still think we have a good relationship 75% of the time. 

I‚Äôve cut off nearly 90% of my friends for her and I struggle now to make new ones. I‚Äôm worried that if I cut her off I will have nobody, and I don‚Äôt really have hobbies anymore too get back into friend groups. 

I am terrified of being alone for life. 

Is there anything I can do? Anything at all to help turn any of this back to what it used to be?  

Sorry for the long post, I just don‚Äôt know who else to turn to.

We had so many ups and downs I can‚Äôt keep track. He hurt me and I hurt him. When I hurt him, it was too much for him, and he broke it off this November. 

I became like a mother to him. He was always at my house since his house and mother (his father was out of the picture) felt unsafe for him. We told each other everything. 

I cheated on him repeatedly. I am a horrible person for this, I know. I hate myself for it. I did so because of my own insecurities and flaws, nothing was his fault. He had his own imperfections, but he tried his best and did all he could for me. The circumstances of the cheating don‚Äôt matter. He forgave me the first time and cut contact with me the second time he found out. As he should. 

I am in a new relationship now (started two months after we ended things). 

I love my new boy. But I think about the first everyday. 

I can‚Äôt get him out of my head. I dream about him most nights. We were in love deeply and I can‚Äôt believe he will remain angry with me forever. I believe he can never trust me again. I mean he said ‚Äúmaybe in the future if you have friends to vouch for your trustworthiness and if the world brings us back together‚Ä¶‚Äù

Is there a sector of therapy that touches on immense grieving before death? I have been going through this since I was 6, and it's still nonstop. I've seen PTSD specialists, ASD specialists, and have talked to therapy and psychologists about my fixation of the fear of their death. None had answers to calm things.

Anonymous_Crowie,"Even though I objectively live a ""good"" life, I hate myself and sometimes, my life. How can I start liking myself and changing my life for the better?",3,1bs1wzt,1,"Hey everyone, 

  
I live a solid life. I'm an international student at a prestigious university on a scholarship, and I came here on scholarships and hard work through high school and even middle school. I have good friends that I spend quality time with, and while I don't have a partner, that doesn't bother me that much. But I'm disgusted by myself. I was finally able to start liking my body a bit more as I entered college, but even that is falling. I feel like I have no self control and I cannot do anything right. I feel like all of my peers are better than me, I hate my dorming situation so it feels like a prison, and I'm battling an addiction (I'm a functioning addict, not drugs). I want to start liking myself, getting my shit in order, and actually live a life I'm happy in. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes I get hit with waves of depression, and I just feel existential dread in my gut. I just want to sob and cry and curl in a ball, escape from my responsibilities and my life. Sometimes I'm disgusted by myself so much the thought of myself nauseates me. I want to be able to stop these, so I was looking for advice.

&#x200B;

I should add as background that I had a pretty bad life so far before basically the sophomore year of high school, and while I was going to therapy for it, I stopped it because I was mocked by my parents. I was basically bullied severely my whole life until then, both verbally and physically, to the extent that sometimes I was beaten nearly every day, and my bones were broken. I'm functioning in life well enough that I can participate in society, but I feel like I'm just waiting to break down, and disappear from this world. And this makes all of my achievements seem smaller in my head as well ‚Äî if I've come so far but I'm unable to escape from these demons, does what I have achieved so far even have value? 

&#x200B;

So I want to fix my shit. I'm trying to go sober from my addiction, and I want to improve myself in other areas as well. My living space in my dorm is severely disorganized because I have OCD, but about cleanliness ‚Äî so many things in my dorm I don't want to even touch. It's better now than at the start of the year but it's still bad. I also have a bad relationship with my roommates because, and I have to face this, I was a bad roommate at the start of the year in terms of cleanliness. I've gotten my shit together a lot more now, but now because of the history every small mistake is pointed out. Anyway, I just want to have good relationships with people, fix my stuff, etc. ‚Äî what can I do?

silvara45,How do you know if it was your schema-informed false self or your authentic self who made critical decisions in the past? (Confusion after therapy sessions) ,3,1brxc0o,6,"Hi all, a bit of a context before my question: I‚Äôve been in therapy for 5 months and  I have strong failure schema as well as unrelenting standards schema. I started therapy because I had a lot of anger towards my mom who has late stage frontotemporal dementia. My therapist said I was enmeshed with mom for years but then once I moved away, this was unravelled. But because we had trauma bonding due to domestic turmoil and difficult divorce mom went thru with my dad, this enmeshment was very complicated. I eventually noticed the codependent relationship I developed with her in my early 30s and l started to feel lots of anger towards my mom who always presented herself as a victim.

Other part of the reason I started therapy was I hit midlife pretty hard, was feeling no joy or excitement in my life, especially professionally. I‚Äôm a tenured professor but have always questioned my career as I do not feel like I ever love it as much as other academics do. I like teaching, but don‚Äôt feel like I really enjoy research. Recently, after many therapy sessions it bothers me that I might have got really into school from an early age not because I loved learning, but I wanted to please my parents, mostly my mom. I was the golden child in the family, and though my parents never forced me to study or pressured me to perform, they always prioritized school work and critiqued my older sister for not paying attention or focusing on her studies. My mom was also a perfectionist and had a lot of anxiety while we were growing up. She was controlling too, but I knew she loved us. She cared about us and took care of us, but she imposed on us lots of her own needs/wants as well. 

Deep inside, I feel like I‚Äôm not as much of an intellectual person as I wish to be. I totally broke bad in college but still ended up getting into a master‚Äôs program and then phd with scholarship in the US. Fast forward, today I still feel inadequate, want to write or speak better but dont want to do the work for it. I do not enjoy isolating myself and reading/writing for days. I just want to be that well versed person who has knowledge on various topics and who can eloquently express themselves, but I personally feel very superficial intellectually. I still feel so out of place in academia at the age of 42, feel like I‚Äôm  an imposter. All my sense of worth is tied to being intellectually strong, but deep inside I feel very superficial intellectually. I‚Äôm a naturally fun loving, social person with a good sense of humor and athletic abilitities.

I have no idea who I am or what I would like to do outside academia, but have this nagging question: did I choose an intellectual path because of a false self I built during my childhood? Who would I be or what would I do if I had space to express my genuine self? Or was being into school my genuine interest?

If not, what assessment does measure whether or not Rogerian methods are appropriate?",1,1bs38su,1,"Some diagnosis/problem background: I have comorbid ADHD and PTSD.

I've had a psychotherapist 7 years ago who defaulted to the non-directive Rogerian methodology, and I did not like it at all. Nothing was accomplished in the 12-15 or so sessions at the time.

More recently, I have been seeing a psychiatrist for medication management and a different psychotherapist for EMDR. My experience with the EMDR psychotherapist has been much better. Still, I figured it may be a good idea to spend $2500 on MMPI-3 and MCMI-4 testing.

So I ask therapists and patients/clients here on Reddit: what can the MMPI-3 say about the appropriateness of Rogerian methods? I'm the neuro-divergent type who doesn't like Rogerian approaches, but I'm curious to know if MMPI-3 can say anything about that? Maybe it will cause me to reconsider?

GreatGooglyMoogly28,Would you recommend switching therapists?,5,1brhb6g,0,"Last year, I began seeing a psychologist for anxiety, depression, and intrusive thoughts related to my sexuality, the latter precipitated by the pandemic. While I realize self-diagnosing can be harmful, reading about HOCD resonated with me, as its symptoms coincided with my struggles over the past few years. (Currently, only GAD is on my record; the existence of OCD tendencies was merely broached as a possibility.) Furthermore, I have experienced some degree of trauma from childhood bullying and years of emotional abuse inflicted by my dad. My past trauma wasn't the primary reason for seeking therapy, though it undoubtedly influenced the development of present issues.  
  
Nevertheless, despite attending over 20 sessions with my psych, I don't feel like much progress has been made. When recalling the goals we established at the beginning of treatment‚Äîalmost one year ago at this point‚Äînone have been fulfilled, in my opinion. Considering I'm paying $200 for appointments every other week, taking baby steps *at best* is frustrating. In fact, during a recent visit with my psychiatric NP, she suggested finding a new mental health provider after I mentioned my concerns to her.  
  
Since my psych was my first therapist, though, I'm unsure if switching would be the best decision. It's difficult for me to discern whether I'm dealing with an incompatible T, misunderstanding how therapy works, and/or overanalyzing the situation lol. The fact that I like her as a person and have some rapport with her doesn't help matters, either. In any case, I'm willing to learn from knowledgeable folks here.  
  
As of the writing of this post, we are in the middle of exposure work. I was relieved to find someone who had experience administering what's deemed the ""gold standard"" for OCD treatment. Together, we developed a hierarchy based on my triggers & obsessions and began addressing the least anxiety-provoking stimuli. To my chagrin, however, this exercise didn't begin until nearly six months into therapy and isn't continued during every session. Instead, other issues are often discussed for the duration of our time. If I inquire about ERP being ignored, her response is generally, ""We'll work on it next time."" Shouldn't ERP be tackled in consecutive weeks, or am I mistaken? Moreover, she doesn't always have her copy of my exposure hierarchy readily available. I've been asked multiple times to decide which item I wanted to address next due to her misplaced paperwork. Perhaps this is standard practice, but having to recall what is *supposed* to be a pre-determined list wastes time and is bothersome.  
  
As a side note, I once alluded to reading about ""pure O"" online, while relating it to my experiences. Her response indicated confusion, implying that the concept didn't exist. Eventually, she claimed that I must have been ""symptom searching,"" thereby blaming it on the health anxiety I sometimes exhibit. Sure, I can be prone to excessive googling, but her comments surprised me. (Please know that I am not dismissing her qualifications!)  
  
In addition, one of my major qualms with her therapeutic process is the lack of tangible solutions. I realize that her job is not to give advice, but I wish her feedback wasn't limited to ""How does that make you feel?"" and ""Why do you think that happened?"" Guidance is seldom offered, if at all. When starting therapy, I assumed maladaptive thoughts and behaviors would be challenged, and coping skills for anxiety provided. The former has not materialized, and her sole recommendation for alleviating anxiety is meditation. Even the instructions I received for that were incredibly vague. Whenever I divulge wanting to learn strategies for managing stress, she merely smiles and remarks, ""That's what we're here for.""  
  
Likewise, our sessions are unstructured, which I've gradually concluded that I dislike. At times, the full hour is dedicated to my response to the introductory question, ""How are you doing?"" rather than the concerns I would prefer to undertake (e.g., ERP). Attempting to change the subject usually results in her emphasizing its importance. (Nonetheless, one time, she tsked me for seemingly presenting too long of an answer to the aforementioned inquiry. Being told something along the lines of ""You don't have to tell me everything that's going on in your life."" felt like a slap in the face when she always requests that information.)  
  
I understand that I am the client, not the psychologist. However, this approach ad nauseam doesn't mitigate my stressors or any of the chief problems that prompted me to find a T in the first place. Indeed, one of the ways my anxiety manifests is through rambling; the unstructured sessions only compound this phenomenon altogether. In a way, I wish I wasn't allowed ""free rein"" over our conversations.  
  
**Overall, what are your recommendations? If you agree with my psych NP that these reservations merit switching providers, which modalities should I look for in potential therapists besides ERP?** My current T specializes in psychodynamic and trauma-focused therapies. More systematic methodologies that are appropriate for my diagnosis and background would be ideal. Finding someone who can assist me in calming my racing thoughts would be amazing. Of course, I am open to sharing these sentiments with my psychologist. Nevertheless, any advice or additional perspectives would be appreciated, especially if continued treatment with her appears unwise for my needs.",1711803565.0,

UphillBattle-,"Want help, afraid to cause more damage",5,1brhzsz,7,"Our son recently went to the school counselor with false claims against step dad. The counselor reported to CPS.

We got the letter in the mail yesterday that CPS feels the report did not meet their guidelines to investigate.

Even though the death was early on in us meeting, I drove four hours to the funeral and stayed by his side the entire time. 

I‚Äôve tried to be really attentive and empathetic during this time of grieving as I genuinely cannot imagine going through such a thing. Unfortunately I‚Äôve not really known him before he turned into a depressed and pessimistic person. I don‚Äôt blame him at all for this, but it‚Äôs been really hard.

Furthermore, as I‚Äôve stuck through him during this, I‚Äôve discovered more and more how we don‚Äôt want the same things in the future. But I feel obligated to stay with him because he is so depressed.

Inner_Razzmatazz9607,What to do if you suspect your therapist is committing insurance fraud and also started making hidden receipts for appointments 6 months ago?,0,1brq2v6,8,"I don‚Äôt want to go into too much detail because I wrote a post like this on
 r/therapyabuse and was not able to log into that community again a few hours after I made the post because it said the community was now private. I don‚Äôt know if I was blocked or the community shut down. I have more detail there, but since investigating more, I have found much more information about how the identity of my therapist may not even be them or in the registered board of where I am located. This has all been virtual. They may not even live in the jurisdiction I am covered for for insurance.

I can elaborate more if need be but want to protect my identity for this case because there are so many shady things that have been happening, if my therapist ever read this, it may never be resolved and I worry they would sabotage this case through their connections. There are 32 points and counting of misconduct of therapy I have uncovered through my research. They are not yet qualified, so I hope to make sure they never get qualified and practice again, and also want ALL my money back.

I gave my virtual therapist my credit card info after meeting them on a reputable therapist listing website because it‚Äôs the only way they can charge me for virtual sessions through their virtual therapy website (it‚Äôs a popular website). 

I am thinking a few routes to go, and wanted other‚Äôs opinions because I think the order I do these could have a lot of effect of what happens based on reactions of others involved:

1. Go to supervisor of therapist in question. Should I contact by phone, email, or in person in their office?

If this is a good step, which is best do you think?

 I would like to ask for the supervisor to put their name on all past receipts for which my therapist left the supervisors name out. They only put the supervisors name sometimes and I had explicitly had many conversations with my therapist to do that always because it‚Äôs the only way I can get insurance to reimburse me. But my therapist shifted receipt releases and appointments and delayed so it was hard to track.

Should I also tell the supervisor of the 32 and counting violations this therapist has done before qualifying them or will the supervisor want to protect their own student? Maybe the supervisor wants to protect their brand and practice? They work in different cities totally. They don‚Äôt really seem affiliated that much or at all online. I would do this after getting the supervisor to sign the receipts and I get my money back from insurance after submitting to insurance again.

2. Contact the Registered Board for my therapist that is not yet qualified. Could be recently qualified but may not be. Would this muddy the waters? I think I should do this after contacting the supervisor and trying to get my money back from insurance first with the new supervisor signature receipts.

3. If all this fails, contact my credit card company and say I did not authorize the claims for which they gave me faulty receipts.

What are your thoughts? This is happening to me and may happen to others. There are a lot more unprofessional things that are in violation of code going on that I let go for so long but there are just too many to list here and it keeps escalating and I don‚Äôt know how to handle this.

The irony is I came to therapy in a very vulnerable state and was not cognizant enough to be aware of all this because I was in deep traumas and believed my therapist when they said  they really wanted to help me and I could trust them and they lied.

I also feel badly that this therapist seems very good and smart and connects with me and I think they could help me because we are almost at a breakthrough point. I feel badly.

Wild_Escape4087,"Anyone Fearful-avoidant, and did therapy help?",1,1browat,1,"Hi all,  
  
I'm 42(M) and never been in a relationship. I have dated over the last few years, most of which don't come to anything. But there have been a couple that could have led to something but I backed away, and the reason for that is that whenever things started to get semi-close, I developed incredibly crippling anxiety - to the point of being physically sick. I then descended into a nightmarish depression with the thought that I've given up my last hope of finding someone to spend my life with. The only thing I can assign the anxiety to is the constant worry that things might not work out, and I'm not getting any younger. I had a very good childhood, loving parents, and very good relationships with all my family and small but close circuit of friends. I do feel sometimes like I'm living my life through them.  
  
It is honestly debilitating. I'm devastated by it all and feel like there's no hope for me. It doesn't help that my friends and siblings are all happily married with children.

But it's one of those instances that when I'm with them, even though I'm not alone, I still feel lonely as they aren't the same thing.

Extra_Rate_8552,Therapist got annoyed at my emotions?,24,1br20hi,36,"When I entered my last therapy session, my therapist pointed out that she would like me not to wait in front of the door but in the foyer (it's a bit more complicated because it's a stationary setting but whatever). 

After that, she was starting the conversation and realised that I was more curt and distant than usual so she asked me if something had happened, if I was tired and so on. After some insistent questions, I told her I was a bit upset about the door thing because I don't like being told rules in retrospect so that I've already done something wrong. This sensitivity about making mistakes is definitely part of my problem. It didn't feel easy to even say that because I knew that it was quite pathetic.

In response to that, she sighed a bit in annoyance and gave me a brief lecture about how it was no biggie, I couldn't have known and besides how it's okay to make mistakes. She then continued the conversation but even though I was answering her questions, apparently still wasn't content. 

So she started asking me if I was mad at her, to which I shook my head. For some reason, she just didn't believe me and then started telling me that we don't have to have this session if I don't want to and that I can leave if I'm gonna be grumpy. And suddenly I felt like a five-year-old having a tantrum and being told by my mum to go to my room until I've pulled myself together. 

The thing is, I wasn't angry at all, only hurt and quite ashamed and that usually makes me want to distance myself and feel like I can't speak freely. But I was really trying to keep engaging in the session.
 After some insisting on my end, we were finally able to move on and after some time, I managed to regulate a bit as well and we actually had a productive session. 

This moment still really hurt me and makes me feel uncomfortable to express my feelings with her in the future. 

I really want to tell my therapist, but it feels like I've been pointing out something like this that has triggered some sensitivity of mine almost every session. I don't want her to think of me as a difficult client or like she's walking on eggshells with me.

The only good part is two nice kids we got (now 15 and 9). I spent 6 years and lots of money on couple therapy trying to improve the relationship, however, nothing helped. I apologized to her about many things, but she never cooperated since she didn‚Äôt see any problem from her side. 
Finally, two years ago, I made a hard decision and divorced from her. I got 50:50 for the kids, however, a year later I had to move a city because of work. I live a new life a new place, and have a dream job. But, broken and depressed. I cannot see my kids as often as I wish, as they are far away. Also, I‚Äôm struggling with the budget. It‚Äôs expensive living alone renting and paying the bills. Also recession makes the things harder‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trying find a qualified job in the home city to be with my kids, but had no success yet. I miss them.
On the other hand, I don't and couldn't see any other way except breaking up. Except sharing the bills I cannot imagine moving back with my ex. 
How should I live now?

Burner42024,ADHD exasperated or normal?,2,1br8fc5,2,"TLDR-Does ADHD possibly play a role in helping you make excuses to not workout well? Is that why stimulants was a game changer at the gym today? I know stimulants will even improve someone without diagnosable ADHD.

(So I commented before about how I have horrible internal voice at the gym telling me to leave early and constantly telling me I'm tired or it's too much weight that I'll hurt myself/can't do it.)

Today I took my prescribed ADHD low dose long acting stimulant and the internal voice was gone!!!! I feel like I had an awesome lifting day and really made the most of it without leaving too early. I didn't even give my self the easy way out of thinking of all the crap I could do if I left early.

Was this just how stimulants effect everyone even with out ADHD? I know most people have some voice talking crap. 

I'd like to think my ADHD played a part in having the constant nagging. Where I have the wandering thoughts about other things I could be doing instead of lifting.

I know it's best to not use anything to accomplish tasks but this was such an improvement I'm thinking of making it my usual. Coffee helped some but made me more self aware. The stimulant helped focus without being all geeked out catching everything that was going on around me.

BTW I know high dose and increasing your heart rate isn't healthy. Since I'm below the average starter dose (""sensitive"") the doc and pharmacist said I could workout without issue.

I can see myself going down this rabbit hole again with my current girlfriend‚Ä¶

I feel very good about where I‚Äôm at and I use what she teaches me to try to be a better partner. 

My husband and I have communication problems. I have my opinions about why, and feel there‚Äôs some work he needs to do. We‚Äôve done a few sessions together with my therapist but only 2-3. He‚Äôs otherwise never been to a therapist/counselor. He had a very traditional upbringing (leave it to beaver style). He doesn‚Äôt seem to believe that our communication issues are partly his fault (I feel like maybe he thinks because I had so much trauma that it‚Äôs me- but I feel as though I‚Äôm actually more self aware because of my trauma). 

We love each other so much - he is an amazing partner and treats me with respect and care. 80% of the time we have an incredible life. But when we fight it‚Äôs literally over nothing but it gets so heated snd it tears us both apart. After being raised in a unstable setting I cannot be in a partnership that is the same. 

We need to see a therapist. He is open to having  my therapist be his alone, and to also go to her together regularly. She is also okay with this. 

In some ways I feel it would be good- because she can build out a whole picture of both of us and what we as individuals need to communicate effectively. And then in together sessions she can help bridge that gap. 

But- I also feel uncomfortable about it. I know she would never share certain things with him so it‚Äôs not about that- but idk, it just feels, a bit weird and I can‚Äôt verbalize why.

My son has tried to go to Uni and had a few jobs. Anything he tries he gets Autistic burn out and has to leave (the last job he tried working part-time). His last job ended Nov 23. Since then symptoms he's always experienced have become more troubling. 

He has mood swings (from a baseline to very depressed, but never goes higher than baseline). He has anxiety attacks if he thinks about volunteering or work. He also now is having trouble leaving the house. He isn't sleeping, he's lost his appetite and his self esteem is very low.

He can leave for 'safe' destinations (places he is familiar with and are quiet). But has anxiety so severe he cannot leave for other reasons. We were due to visit an historic house today, which he was looking forward to but he can't leave the house today due to how awful the anxiety is.

I'm very worried but he won't go to the GP. The worry/stress of supporting him worsens my own chronic health condition. I feel like we are spiralling downwards together.

I don't know what to do. I'm trying to shield him from the knowledge of how the worrying about him is impacting me as I don't want him to feel worse. But nobody will help us unless he is willing to talk to someone.

His answer rubbed me the wrong way. It was very one-sided towards ""yea you should keep it consistent and long-term"" without much consideration for the perspective of seeing a therapist as needed. It really made me suspicious about how much his incentive to keep having consistent patients colored his answer. Especially because a previous therapist I had one session with seemed very questionable to me and had terms in his contract stating that a patient decides to stop therapy then they should have at least 3 sessions with the therapist to explore the reasoning for that‚Ä¶

Today I had my first session with a therapist, who I immediately felt comfortable with- he breezed through right at appointment time, lightly smelled of a freshly smoked cigarette, coffee cup in hand. Relatable. I unleashed on this guy. Just dumped it all and word vomited on him. He kept up, asked appropriate questions, and completed my intake. It felt like as I verbalized everything, I began to realize that while I got all of this information out into the open (and felt better having done that), I was staring at a mountain of work that felt terrifying and honestly shameful. He explained that in our session next week we are going to dig deeper on the issues and begin discussing a plan and he told me he was glad that I came today and that it was a big step. The more I think about it, the more I want to bail. That sounds awful. Logically, my brain knows I'm doing the right thing getting help and working through all of these things that I have packed away into neat little boxes inside myself. Irrationally, I want to cram all of that shit back inside and pretend I never cracked and I'm fine. I'm looking for encouragement that although the work might suck, the end result will be worth it. There's a lot of grief, trauma, friendship issues, marital issues, and parenting issues if anyone sees some of that in their own story. Thank you in advance for sharing, if you're comfortable to.",1711665446.0,
walkingisgoodd,This is so hardüòû,1,1bqehn5,0,"I am having a really hard time moving on from my ex, it hurts really bad, here‚Äôs the details:

She was my first girlfriend, we lasted about a year. I (male) was 24 and she was 23 when we began dating. We are very similar. She used to say we were 2 sides of the same coin. We had similar personalities, values, interests, hobbies,struggles, insecurities and etc. I never knew someone like her could exist. I love her so much. She means so much to me. I‚Äôve never felt so loved and accepted. She was so incredibly special. She also loved me very strongly and wanted to marry me.

Anyway, I screwed up and caused the end. There were many flaws I didn‚Äôt really know I had because I wasn‚Äôt ever in a relationship before. The first half was pretty good but halfway through I had an emotional crisis and became complacent. Basically I would say things that hurt her unintentionally and at times it would confuse me, and at other times I knew better. I do think there may have been a personality difference aswell but I think it‚Äôs totally workable. And I think I could have been more considerate. I also shared some things that should not be shared. I basically made all these really dumb and avoidable mistakes. I feel like an idiot for screwing up so royally with someone so amazing. She lost trust in me and explained it as a thousand paper cuts. I take responsibility for all my wrong. It was me and I hate what I‚Äôve done. I totally get why it ended logically and I have changed through the heartbreak.

So‚Ä¶..

It‚Äôs been the most painful experience in my life. I have never cried so hard in my life. I‚Äôll admit I idealize her alot because a big part of me is convinced she is almost perfect. She literally doesn‚Äôt really have many flaws. She‚Äôs just wonderful. So that makes it extra hard to move on. It‚Äôs been about 4 months since the breakup. She has moved on but I am still in alot of pain. And seeing her move on does hurt a lot. It makes me feel like I don‚Äôt mean anything to her or I wasn‚Äôt special enough but I know that‚Äôs not completely true, it‚Äôs just my emotions. But it still hurts really bad.

Here are some specific  moving on struggles I have:


Her~ who she is. She is incredibly unique. I have never met anyone like her. When I say we matched, we really matched. And she was the only person who has seen me fully and loved me fully. She‚Äôs the only human I could be my true full self around and feel secure and safe. I‚Äôve always felt alone growing up, I always felt different, never fit in to any groups really. Like I love science, the outdoors, theology, video games, most genres of music, movies and more. I just feel like I don‚Äôt fit into a group and neither did she. and not only on this surface level stuff but on deeper levels too. So I felt like I found a twin flame or a soul mate, it blew my mind.

 Also something very special. There were some things that were very specific that she shared with me from her past that was so important for me in the relationship. It made me feel loved and accepted, understood. Like I don‚Äôt know how I would find someone like that again. And it‚Äôs very important to me:

EXAMPLE ( we‚Äôre Christians, but we both were atheist/agnostic at a certain point in our life and it really helps to discuss confusions and doubts from her perspective. She grounded me in a way I couldn‚Äôt. I never had this with anyone else and i can‚Äôt express how important it is to me, almost a need. Just to have someone who understands and has the same way of thinking is gold.
Also we both had pretty bad porn addictions in the past and having someone who gets that struggle means the world to me. I feel accepted and that person understands me and I get them. I feel like if I was with a person who didn‚Äôt struggle with porn and didn‚Äôt have an agnostic/atheist past I would feel scared to share my feelings and be my true self out of fear of them not understanding. I feel like it would be hard to get emotional fulfillment and understanding. So this is very important to me. But how the heck would I find someone like this again? How possible is it? It makes me so sad and scared.

Physical~ This is a weird one, but it actually hurts a lot. I wish it didn‚Äôt but it does. So‚Ä¶ everything about her physically I love and i think she is so beautiful. Down to the most minute details. From her leg shape, her skin tone, her hair, her face shape, nose, lips, her waist, etc. it‚Äôs just her look which is overwhelmingly attractive to me. It‚Äôs like she has the perfect physique and face to me. She has a very unique look too. She is mixed so she looks very unique and is so gosh darn beautiful in every way. I don‚Äôt know how to be with anyone else without comparing them to her. Like when I see other attractive woman in public I automatically compare them to her and they are no match in any way. It‚Äôs just her look, she is crazy beautiful and hot. It actually hurts very deep. I know it‚Äôs just looks and shouldn‚Äôt matter this much but it‚Äôs hurting me and preventing me from moving on.


That‚Äôs what‚Äôs on my heart right now, so what do I do about this? Can someone else really fulfill me like her? And is there anyone out there like that? It just hurts really bad right now.

,Thinking about switching Therapists,2,1bq46xj,8,"I was seeing a therapist and then they moved away and now I year later I decided to try therapy again but not sure what to think or feel because this new therapist and approach we are taking is different from previous therapists I have had.  
  
I saw a therapist short term for a semester in college and once I graduated we parted ways.  
  
A year after I saw another therapist (that moved away) for almost a year i think.  


These therapists were into like talk therapy where you go in and you tell them about what's been going on and they talk through with you and process your thoughts and feelings  
  
My new therapist is cool and very understanding and validating when we did our intake sessions but now I am not sure about our approach. Our sessions have been feeling very active? orderly/systematic? we've been going over a lot of meditative/grounding exercises which I also have been doing at home like hw and I am open to because I know they will help be when I am feeling panicky but part of me is also missing the past talk therapy and internally I feel something is disconnected???  
  
I have contacted another new therapist and they now have responded right away and I guess I am not sure what to do? or confused about what I need or want?  
  
Overall I am trying to find a balance bc I also would feel exhausted with so much talk therapy but I was also nervous to talk to my last therapist about how i felt with that too.   
  
I'm not sure how to tell my therapist how I been feeling or think? I get there they check in with me and I respond yeah alright and then we get straight to the exercises",1711653845.0,

She apparently said to my wife ""Stop looking for validation.  All of my patients are looking for validation and it's burning me out!""

It seems to me that this therapist shouldn't put her professional stressors on my wife.  My wife is unsure, wondering if it's just tough love or if it was inappropriate.  Either way, it hurt her to be spoken that way when in a vulnerable state.

Of note - this wasn't my session, so I don't know the exact context, but my wife isn't someone to really elaborate something like this.  Also, we know that the therapist's mom has been very sick and she recently took a few weeks off, so the therapist is definitely stressed in her personal life and is possibly dealing with the loss of her mother.

Lately I have been having some problems with a coworker who told me I am weak and look tired ( that is because I look thin, I am 61kg per 170cm my bmi is perfect) but she is overweight, I answered her how strength has nothing to do with a person being thin or fat ... and she kept labeling me as weak ... I thought this is a good idea to discuss with my therapist how to defend myself in such events as I refuse to be labeled that ( and my mom used to call me that too when I was a child so it hurts a lot ) so my therapist told me :""anyway you always very sensitive and can get offended by a normal thing"" and this is the second time she addresses me as oversensisitve even if I already told her that I am not and that it hurts ... after the session I sent her a message on whatsap (it's common for us) and she told me : "" just accept it and get over it and this is not discussable just accept it"" and told me to speak my ideas during the session next time.

BroadwayGuy123,Best friends of 20 years ended our friendship. I don‚Äôt know what to think.,1,1bq7p5h,1,"For 20 years, I‚Äôve had a childhood best friend. We met in preschool and did everything together. She was in a bad living situation, and I helped her through everything, from family drama to not getting enough food to losing a house. Once we both graduated high school, though, things started to get more complicated. She stayed behind to do community college, and I went to a public college on the other end of the state. We didn‚Äôt have a lot of time to spend together because we were focused on our studies. I would still see her during spring and summer breaks so we were fine. Everything changed though once I graduated college.

I decided during my last semester to take an internship to a dream job I really enjoy. The only thing is it‚Äôs three states away, meaning I would not be coming back to my home state. She could sense this and kept gaslighting me to come back to my home state and abandoned this job. She was never supportive of my dream, and only cared about what she wanted. Regardless, I moved out of my home state and I‚Äôve now a current resident of my current state and have a happy full time job. I think this is where the tear started.

Because we moved out of the school era, and are now full on adults, I didn‚Äôt have a lot of time to hang out with her as much because I was focusing on making so many hours and paying the bills. It was hard to have a long distance, friendship, but I thought she understood, considering my parents do the same thing with their college friends, who they haven‚Äôt spoken to in over a year, but the friends are totally ok with it because they have their own life. She also doesn‚Äôt like the fact I have a boyfriend and she‚Äôs not the most important person in my life anymore

Well I woke up to a text this morning to a text from her saying she is upset that we don‚Äôt talk as much, which is valid, but what got to me was she said ‚ÄúI get that I‚Äôm not the most important person in your life, and that‚Äôs fine, but even on our calls I feel like your therapist instead of your friend. Either pay me or fix yourself if you wanna be friend again‚Äù Keep in mind that I‚Äôve been her therapist for 10 YEARS and the one time I break down, she gets upset. I bought her school lunches for 7 years. I gave her shelter. I gave her my time as a friend to listen and help and I never asked for a thank you. I went through so much trauma as a minor and it wasn‚Äôt even mine. But the one time I break down, I‚Äôm met with backlash instead of support, which I‚Äôve given her on 10 years.

I‚Äôm really sad it‚Äôs over, cause she was my best friend, but if she wants to use me instead of being an actual friends then so be it. I just could really use some kind works cause I‚Äôm really upset

Today was my third meeting with my counselor. I talked for quite awhile about the difficulties I've had, namely with socializing. And I concluded it by explaining that was a big reason I've thought I could be autistic.

And my counselor actually understood. He told me it's understandable why I would suspect I have autism, and he referred me to have an evaluation at my school's psychology clinic (something I didn't even know existed, seperate from the normal counseling service...)

All this time, I've sat here going back and forth about if it was even worth doing, if I'm just overthinking it.

4215265,3 years of therapy and I've started to resent my therapist,5,1bpefxo,2,"Hello all,

&#x200B;

I'm 23F and I've been in psychotherapy for 3 years now. Diagnosed OCD, Anxiety, CPTSD, and my therapist has helped me through my sexual assault and resulting PTSD which happened a few months into seeing her. I've had a few therapists in the past but no one has been as influential as her. I used to love going to her and look forward to seeing her every week, but things have shifted in the last 6 months. 

&#x200B;

It seems like everything I say, she immediately links back to my parents. It feels like I genuinely can't say anything right without being questioned and pried. Whenever I start a session, I'll explain my week, and then she'll start talking about how there's ""something we're not getting at"" or ""something I'm not saying"", then prescribes actions or emotions I don't completely identify with but have no choice in agreeing to because if I don't, then I'm being avoidant. I am having a hard time determining if it's a me problem or her problem (as in, if I should switch therapists). 

&#x200B;

In general, I have in fact felt very avoidant lately. I don't feel connected to myself emotionally, and have a hard time opening up to others. This seems highly situational as I am graduating college and am navigating this new life change and resulting high amounts of stress. I feel like I don't have the emotional capacity to commit to finding a job and having everything in my life change (say, if I were to have to relocate), on top of confronting all the things she needs me to confront when no one in my life (especially my parents) have really given me grief lately. 

&#x200B;

I know you should stop seeing someone if you don't feel comfortable with them and can't open up, I just think this situation is different because I've been with her for years. It just doesn't feel like I'm seeing her as the same person anymore. I dread going to therapy, and really resent her for whatever reason. This is something we've talked about for 2/4 of the last weekly sessions, I just feel like I've hit a wall so I'm coming to you for advice. ",1711576987.0,

And  either she finished the sentence with ‚Äúnot that clean‚Äù OR, she made a face suggesting unclean. I honestly can‚Äôt remember, but her tone and body language made it very clear what she was suggesting. She was essentially saying ‚ÄúWell maybe you being picky about those things is justified since white people can be a little nasty.‚Äù

I honestly  don‚Äôt think she is racist or meant any harm, BUT the comment was troublesome(for my reasons below) and I don‚Äôt think I want to work with her anymore. But I‚Äôm experiencing extreme stress and anxiety and really need therapy asap. Should I stay or just start on the hunt for someone else?

 My issues:
1.) Therapist are humans and yes have their own biases and stereotypes, but when you‚Äôre in sessions it‚Äôs your job to remain unbiased and not speak on racial stereotypes 
2.) as my therapist she should have remembered that my fianc√© is white and how that comment could be offensive to me
3.) I‚Äôm not 100% that she doesn‚Äôt have more racial biases. I don‚Äôt know if I want therapy from  someone like that‚Ä¶.",1711562832.0,

SavingsSea9387,Rula (formerly Path) - Issues with billing,2,1bpaqgi,4,"Hi there! Looking for some potential guidance here or if anyone has any similar experience. So I left my job back in December and have been using Rula (formerly Path) for about a year and a half. I haven't had any issues, everything was fine up until this year.

Yesterday I got a notice from my bank that Rula was trying to charge me 600 dollars out of nowhere? I instantly logged in to look at my billing, and see the charge with no explanation as to what it is. So I contacted support to figure out what the charge is for. I got a generic copy paste reply telling me how to look at my billing which was insanely unhelpful and the report they generated didn't show the charge either which was frustrating. They asked if I still needed help, I said yes and explained I still have no idea what this charge is for. They told me they escalated to the billing specialist team and to wait 3-5 business days. Today, the ""billing specialist"" replied...who was the same person and they stated that my insurance ran out on 1/4/24 and that they had been improperly billing me. They sent me a bunch of dates with amounts associated, all of which don't match what I've actually been billed. It looks like they've been improperly billing me by a large margin since January and I'm assuming this charge is them trying to recoup the money.

In the new year, I logged in and removed my insurance from my account to pay out of pocket. I asked them to provide a timestamp for when this action was taken in my account, to which they completely ignored and followed up with that ""something was improperly set and is now fixed, you'll now be billed 150 dollars per session.""

Sorry for the novel here, but this whole ordeal has been insane to deal with. Has anyone experienced something similar? Or does anyone know how I should handle? Also, important to highlight that this is for mental health services. Luckily I'm in a very good place after all the work I've done but what if I wasn't? I've clearly lost my insurance and 600 dollars isn't a simple charge - super bad look for Rula.",1711568055.0,

TransSpiderBaby,Issues withTherapy Provider,1,1bpaplj,1,"  My husband had to leave his therapy provider due to being ghosted with poor communication. There was an issue where he had to cancel due to an extreme emergency and was charged a late fee. He was able to get it credited because it was such a fluke. The therapy provider had many issues with communication and the owner was a very poor communicater. His therapist also did not respond to his requests to set up a new appointment. He had to be seen once a month or he would be dropped. So he reached out and spoke to the owner and was told he had a session scheduled for monday (unknown to him.)

   I drove him that monday an hour away to the appointment and left. He called me extremely upset because his therapist was not told he had an appointment and was not there and would mot be comming. He left to go wait at a resturant whilevI drove back to get him. He was also grazed by a car which made it all the worse. 

  I called the office and said we were done as well as wanting a refund of the credit we were promised. They never reached out via email like promised. So my husband contacted them one friday and I contacted them a couple times. I left polite messages and when I taljed to people they said they would help but then (from what I understand) they talked to the owner and she shut any help or attempts to get it resolved down. I eventually talked to her and she was not helpful or willing to move forward looking into getting the account resolved in a timely manner at all. I because very upset and was just pleading basiclly to resolve this but she was not willing to work with us. She said it would take time and that she did not want to credit us the money.

I never felt like it did much for me. I vented and complained, tried books and CBT but never walked away feeling like I made headway in my issues. 
I am a 37 yr old female. I was bullied severely in middle school and high school. So bad that my mom allowed me to drop out and get my G.E.D. I started working full time at 16 and met a boy at 17, got pregnant at 18 and had my first child at 19. I lived in the same town as my bullies and often ran into them, which made me feel weak, like they won. I tried college, but ended up classes with people I went to school with so I dropped out becauae it was too much like high school for me. I went on to have another child,  then got divorced and remarried and had another child.
 I never moved out of my hometown as much as I wanted to. Financially it just wasnt an option and after I remarried, my current husband has children from a previous so of course he wanted to be near them. 
Im 37, kids almost adults now, still never went to college, still living the same town, kids went to the same school I did, often seeing my bullies because they of course had children as well. I have wasted so much of my life being scared, allowing what others had to say hold me back from my own life. I feel like such a failure. A complete failure. Bullied in school, stupid, never had a job that wasnt retail or restaurants because i have never felt I had any education or skills that were good enough for anything else. I want to take back my life. I want to stop being scared. I want to stop allowing people that probably dont even know I even exist, or even remember what they did to me, have such control over my life. 

As much as I would love to move away, its not a possibility still, maybe even ever. My dad passed away a couple of years ago and my mother lives alone now.  I cannot imagine leaving her. I do hate that because I know it would make me so much happier but leaving my mom would destroy me. 

I have spent years trying to move on with my life, but anytime Im in a situation where my old classmates might be, I go right back to feeling like that weak 15 year old girl. My children are almost grown. I want the 2nd part of my life to be so much better than the 1st. I want to get a better job. I want to learn and grow.  I have been looking into options. There is a local trade school that has a 8 week orthodontic assistant program I might do, or the local community college is offering a free pharmacy tech certification becauae its the first year offering it, or I might take my workkeys and go work as  a teacher aide for a school or maybe get my servesafe certification and go work at the school in the lunchroom since I have so much knowledge already in food service from my years of working in restaurants.

rakedyrdek,My experience with a judgmental therapist who wanted to push medication on me even though I was against it,1,1bp4bpj,1,"
Hey! Just wanted to share this with y‚Äôall. Comments and feedback appreciated.

I had started seeing a therapist for issues with anxiety around late December. The anxiety issues mainly related to sleep but there was anxiety for other stuff as well, and with the sleep anxiety issues came minor OCD as well (rituals that I would start to do to make sure that I would sleep good or that I would have a good day). This was the first therapist I‚Äôve ever had, so I didn‚Äôt really know what to expect. 

The sessions started out really good, she gave me a lot of good advice on dealing with the anxiety and a lot of it did make me feel better. After a few sessions though I started to notice some things about her that I wasn‚Äôt too big of a fan of. The first thing I started to notice was that she tends to be really judgy with a lot of things. When I would say something she wouldn‚Äôt agree with she often times would respond with judgy comments or if not a judgy comment then it would be a comment that showed her disagreeance with what I had said but it would still have a judgy tone to it. She can also seem very transactional and non-empathetic too. Still though, I was already locked in with her so I continued to see her. Her advice for dealing with the anxiety did help but the thing is there was still a lot of back and forth with my anxiety, it was getting better but then there were still some bad days where the anxiety felt strong; the bad days started getting less and less but they were still there. Upon hearing this, she had suggested I start taking antidepressants. I had told her ‚Äúmaybe, but I‚Äôm not sure if I want to go down that route‚Äù. She still pushed that I take em and that ‚Äúit is a part of the process‚Äù. I ended up going to see a psychiatrist a week or so later, got prescribed them, but right before I took them I said to myself ‚Äúlemme try to give myself a week or two to see if my mood and anxiety improves before taking em‚Äù, and in those couple weeks I started being more active with hiking and rock climbing and started really dissecting my irrational thoughts that caused my anxiety and noticed that my mood and ability to deal with the anxiety was improving, so I never took em. Fast forward to yesterday, I saw my therapist for the first time in a while (she had to cancel for like three weeks in a row) and she had asked me if I started on the meds yet. I told her ‚Äúno, I‚Äôve been doing things that have been making me feel better such as being active, so never got around to taking them, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna‚Äù and at this point I could sense some frustration from her as she responded with a judgy and annoyed tone ‚Äúhuh; ok‚Äù. We were about to move on to the next topic but after hearing that I responded with ‚Äúis everything ok?‚Äù She responded back with ‚Äúso you do understand that the meds are a part of the process right?‚Äù She then went on and on about how I ‚Äúneed‚Äù to be taking them and was pretty much insinuating that I wouldn‚Äôt get with better without them. All this was done with a judgy tone of course. Also worth noting that she completely disregarded the fact that I said I was feeling better due to having started hiking and rock climbing, just gave a quick ‚Äúuh ok,‚Äù no ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to hear that being active is making you feel better!‚Äù Needless to say, we got into a back n forth about how I just would rather not take meds and it went on for a while before it was dropped. 

A few things worth noting after that sesh: 
I left that sesh feeling worse than ever. I had felt so good those couple weeks too but that session really did bring back on the anxiety that all the rock climbing and hiking helped alleviate. Almost feel like I‚Äôm at square one again at this point but I know I‚Äôll get out of it. The anxiety mainly comes from the fact that I had put so much time into seeing this person and building this bond with her and putting her on this pedestal only for this to occur. I feel like a good therapist should respect the wishes of their client. If a client does not feel comfortable going the medication route, then why try to force it? They should be able to say ‚Äúok, that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll work with you even though you don‚Äôt want to take meds‚Äù. Statements such as ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never get better if you don‚Äôt take em‚Äù just leave such a bad taste in my mouth, and I‚Äôm not gonna lie it really did mess with me for a bit, I started thinking ‚Äúwhat if I do need to take the meds and won‚Äôt get better without them?‚Äù but I have been slowly coming to my senses and realizing that there are ways to work with anxiety outside of meds and that just cuz it came out of a therapist‚Äôs mouth doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs always right. Needless to say, I will be contacting her soon to discontinue my appointment with her and looking elsewhsere.",1711552465.0,
powerofself,Therapist wants me to do a daily diary card ,1,1bp3sex,11,"TL/DR; - diary cards don‚Äôt work for me, but I want the therapy! Any alternatives please?

I‚Äôm in DBT and my 1:1 wants me to do a daily diary card which essentially ranks how I feel against about 9 different emotions (anxiety, sadness, shame etc) and then I have to do a bit of discussion around 3 target behaviours. One of mine being ‚Äòto not avoid what needs doing‚Äô - ironic huh? 

In addition to this, there‚Äôs something called a rehearsal card which essentially lists ALL the DBT skills and has a grid for each day of the week against each skill, I am to highlight if I used a skill on a particular day. 

The issue - I hate this method??? I find myself literally never doing it until half an hour before my session and I‚Äôm trying to remember how I was feeling or what I was doing 1-2 weeks before. Sometimes it‚Äôs up to 4 weeks between sessions. I understand the premise behind diary cards, they help you to stay mindful and you can keep track of triggers and even what skills to focus more on. However, for whatever reason, I really don‚Äôt like doing it and I just won‚Äôt! I am diagnosed with adhd (and autism), not sure if it‚Äôs purely just avoidance or simply something that doesn‚Äôt work for me.

What would you do? Are there any alternatives? Journaling isn‚Äôt something I do daily and I find it hard to make a routine out of it, perhaps that‚Äôs the problem?

bbangelcakes69,"I just saw a little girl, about 8 years old, get hit head on by a car. ",5,1bon0mk,13,"Idk how to feel, I kinda feel dumb for being so upset about it since idk who this person even is but I can't stop crying. I'm scared that she got internal bleeding and might die. I'm so scared for her and I don't know why. I can't stop seeing her get hit by the car because it keeps playing through my head and I can't stop it. 

It was in my neighborhood and I was crossing the opposite side of the street as her and her family but going the same direction. Our walk light is about to go on and the car is accelerating super fast to go through the red light. I saw them doing this so I pulled myself back as it passes my cross walk. I turn my head to glare at them, annoyed that they sped through to get a red light when I see them passing through the next cross walk with the girl and her little brother running out in front of the car.

I'm the one who called 911 and gets a hold of an ambulance while everyone else is treating the child. The car thankfully pulled over instead of driving off and the girl at first glance looks like she broke her leg. A lady, I assume is her mom or sis, is holding her and making sure she doesn't pass out. The girl and her brother are just screaming which I know is a good thing since it means she isn't unconscious but jeez that made it more surreal.

I also had to talk to the cops which was scary cus I had to think about it more especially since I was the only one on the other side of the streets and saw the car before anymore else. I saw it speeding up way before the collision far down the street and I knew it was gonna run the light. I think I'm the only one who saw it from that side of the street and that will probably mean I need to be in court. The only reason why I would hope to be called on for court is so I can know of the girl is okay.

The boy I don't think got hit or wasn't hit to the extent she was and was walking fine but was scared for his sister. The ambulance comes & she is not unconscious but isn't speaking, crying, or screaming anymore just pointing to where it hurts. She points to her right hip which makes sense since that is where she was struck. I assume she is in shock and probably not feeling much due to the adrenaline rushing through her. It's still better than being unconscious but I'm just scared that it's something more. 

Writing stuff down helps me cope as well as this will be a good source to look back on if I'm called to court as a witness. I guess I kinda want advice cus idk why this is so traumatic since idk these ppl and I'm fine. I just really hope that the girl is okay and doesn't die. I'm really scared she will die and I'm so freaking mad at the lady who hit her. Like why do people run red lights in a small neighborhood like mine why the heck was she going as fast as hlshe was it was so horrible to end this way and I'm extremely angry. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience and have advice on how to cope? As I'm finishing writing I do not feel any better so I think I need to try something else but don't know what. I also feel bad for wishing bad things to the driving cus violence isn't helpful but if the girl gets paralyzed in the legs I hope something happens to do the same to the driver. An eye for an eye, I don't want her to die if the girl dies though. 

TLDR: I saw a girl get hit by a speeding car and I'm really upset about it. I want advice cus idk why I'm so upset. ",1711496379.0,

gnsocialite,Crying during therapy feels embarrassing ,1,1botvdi,3,"I‚Äôve been in and out of therapy for nine years, and something I‚Äôve never really been able to get over is how embarrassed I feel when I end up crying during a session. I have no doubt it‚Äôs linked to the childhood emotional abuse that put me in therapy to begin with, but it feels like no matter how much I tell myself that crying is normal, it‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs not shameful, and it certainly isn‚Äôt anything my therapist hasn‚Äôt seen before‚Äî I just feel embarrassed. I think it‚Äôs one of my biggest roadblocks in getting better. I‚Äôm supposed to be working through and processing all these negative emotions, and I still tiptoe around the Big Stuff, or anything I think might make me cry because I don‚Äôt want anybody else to see me like that, in such a vulnerable state.

I cried in session today, the first time I cried in front of my new therapist, and it felt like I couldn‚Äôt stop. It wasn‚Äôt even full-on sobbing, just a steady stream of tears, but I couldn‚Äôt look him in the eye for the rest of the session and I felt disgusted with myself every time I heard my voice crack. It just made me feel worse.

And to be clear‚Äî I don‚Äôt think crying generally is shameful at all. When I see anybody else cry, I don‚Äôt think any less of them and I never would. I know deep down that it‚Äôs the most normal, natural thing in the world. I just have this insurmountable exception for myself, that *I* need to be ashamed, that *I* am repulsive when I cry.

It‚Äôs worse because I have OCD, and my brain is telling me that basically because I cried that means my therapist is evil and I need to quit. This is more of a rant so I tagged it as such, but if anyone has also had problems with this feeling or advice for getting over it I‚Äôd really appreciate it.",1711515875.0,

I was already progressed from level 1 to level 2 a year ago, and I was up for another progression this time from level 2 to level 3.

My leader told me to be proactive in being a leader, speaking up, helping others, and taking the initiative, which I have been, more so than other people above my level.

All my colleagues kept saying how they hope and I deserve to get promoted. These progressions happen in batches, so a group of people get progressed at once. Yesterday calls were made notifying people who got it. Colleagues and friends that got it notified me, and I congratulated those who well deserved it. I never got the call, so I asked my leader, and he essentially said I didn‚Äôt get it.

So I have been trying to figure it out on my own but unable to do so. 

I was seeing a guy and I introduced him to my therapist for couple therapy last year. I am my therapist's client from 4 years. We took 6 sessions together. I realized this can't work out. So we ended it there. 

It happened in September 2023.

Fast forward to March 2024, I saw him added in my therapist's friendlist as my therapist also happens to be a public figure. However, she doesn't add people randomly on her facebook profile. She adds people selectively. 

I got extremely triggered by it seeing my ex added on her friendlist. I also assume he is her client now as well in the personal capacity. 

Now I am clueless and feeling so dumb here right now. 

I tried taking a session with her but she got all defensive, brought the ethical framework in between, and how her supervisor said this and that....that she hasn't breached any code of conduct etc. Although she neither confessed nor denied if she is seeing him (my ex) as a client.

I took session from another therapist. But she refused to comment on this incident saying she cannot comment on the ethical conduct of a therapist who she doesn't know. 

I just feel extremely heartbroken right now as I am her one of the oldest clients. 

I am just wondering if I am over reacting to the situation or has it happened with others too? How did you guys cope with such a situation? 

At one side, I want to terminate my sessions. On the other side, I want to give her a benefit of doubt. 

Most importantly, am I allowed to ask my therapist if she's seeing my ex as a client? As so far, it's just my assumption. I have just seen his comment on my therapist's social media profile so far where only people added in one's friendlist can comment. Other public people can just see the post.

In other words, if I am obsessing over a perfect solution to a problem, I should approach it with open-mindedness and do whatever potential solution my brain comes up with, without worrying whether it‚Äôll work or not.

This has been helping me the past few weeks, but I realized something troubling the other day. Even if this has been working, it can‚Äôt be a perfect solution to overthinking, because perfect solutions don‚Äôt exist. Since I tend to overthink everything, I‚Äôve been using this technique all the time, and now I‚Äôm worried it won‚Äôt work anymore. I‚Äôm getting stuck on obsessing over what open-mindedness even means, and when and how I should use it, and whether it will even work or not.

Any advice on this?",1711479448.0,

so for years i've been told by the people closest to me i should look at getting therapy because i'm a very closed off and introverted person who has been through a lot in my life but especially during my childhood. I've always put it off because the idea of talking to a stranger about things that i can't talk to my closest friends/family about scares me beyond belief.

I booked this appointment last week when i felt really motivated for it however now that it is coming up i'm experiencing a lot of anxiety and i'm regretting it big time but i feel like i need to do it for my daughter.

I'm seeking advice on how to approach forgiving my father and repairing our relationship. How can I work through these feelings effectively?

Long story short, I suffer from 13 years of abuse in every way imaginable.  From ages 17-30 by my ex husband.  Now that we are long away from him, I‚Äôm afraid the damage is still imbedded in to my brain.  I am ok for most days, but other days, the slightest trigger, will cause me to go in a horrible downward spiral.  

I have seen a therapist previously, after being released from a behavioral facility.  She was really nice, but I‚Äôm afraid her ‚Äúwhat did you do today? How was your day?‚Äù Tactics weren‚Äôt very helpful.  I would reply with, ‚Äú uhhh, I ate some lunch?‚Äù  Haha it was just too many quiet moments and non moving forward, topics.  I stopped going to her two months later.  

The behavior facility was a nightmare, and damaging to me as well, in more ways than I could tell you about on this thread, horrible place.  Which now, I have to mentally deal with that on the daily.

Anywho,

My doctor prescribed me an anti depressant, which 3 weeks later, led me to swallowing over 100 pills, and ended up on a lengthy 1 v 1 suicide watch/ psych ward stay.

I want to start off with some background information ‚Ä¶
So I (24F) have been seeing my current therapist for about 10 months now. I started going to therapy because I was in a relationship at the time that I really cared about and my unhealed trauma and mental health was effecting our relationship. Beyond that, I also just wanted to get help for myself so that I could finally be happy. 
At first, I found our sessions to be very helpful and I couldn‚Äôt imagine being comfortable with another therapist. However, lately she‚Äôs made some comments and suggestions that don‚Äôt align with what I am trying to in therapy, as well as comments that I find insensitive. (For example, I struggle with relationship anxiety and overthinking. This got even worse when my ex and I broke up. She has asked me at least 3 times what I think about the fact that my ex and I have been in no contact for so long, which my response is always that the length of time doesn‚Äôt bother me because I know I will either hear from him, or move on with someone else eventually and there‚Äôs no rush for more answers right now. She then goes on to say ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs taking him so long ‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt it strange?‚Äù - this type of thinking is exactly what triggers my overthinking and leads to anxiety and SHE KNOWS THIS.) 
Also, she suggested to me that I break no contact. I think pretty much anyone in my scenario should not be breaking no contact (I was broken up with and we mutually decided to go no contact at least until he is comfortable reaching out to me - it‚Äôs a long story that I am not willing to share here. Essentially, my ex is aware that he can reach out to me at anytime and is choosing not to). But, on top of that, one of my goals in therapy is to try and break my anxious attachment. I think her making this suggestion does not align with my goals, and is not good advice.

Dear fellow redditors,

I am a 33 year old single male and no matter how hard I try I feel that I cannot change into the person I want to become. Since 2013 I have been trying with some progress to abstain myself from my sexual addiction which entails massage parlors and prostitutes. I say little progress because I haven‚Äôt been seeing prostitutes since 2017 but for some I cannot stop myself from going to massage parlors. Last year I visited such places two times and today marks the first time this year that I paid a visit.

On top of that I use to be a daily smoker, however I managed to cut that last year and on May 30 would mark my first year anniversary weed free. 

I rarely drink, but when I do I usually drink a lot. This weekend was one of those days in which I drank a 750ml bottle of tequila and in this hangover I decided today to get a massage and a happy ending. Now I feel horrible because it feels as if my progress is beginning to diminish again. I don‚Äôt want to be like this because I know the energy I put into the world has negative effects on those around me. I hate myself because I know I‚Äôm doing good by working, hitting the gym, attending to my family needs and reading and then this happens and there is no one to blame but myself. 

I know I won‚Äôt be going back anytime soon or even plan on drinking again but time will pass and that feeling to go to a massage parlor will re-emerge. In fact, I have been fighting this desire for months until finally giving in today. I lost the battle again and it feels that I‚Äôll never be completely free from my sexual addiction. 

I need help.

ShinyLikeACrow,"Psychologist shows his colors- clinical red flags, or excusable human flaws?",6,1bnd3oj,3,"I've been seeing my psychologist for nearly a year and aside from some minor issues, it's been a generally positive experience, until the last session. My instinct is to leave his practice because of his behavior, but I'm questioning if I'm overreacting, as he suggests. Any impartial opinions/advice/reassurance would be most appreciated. 

Lately, he has been encouraging assertiveness instead of my usual people pleasing and socially submissive tendencies. I've taken the advice and have begun working it into my current relationships, making sure that I don't railroad my own wants/needs just because it'd be easier for others if I did. In continuing to embrace this new mindset, I *very* respectfully expressed my feelings about being misrepresented/misunderstood in some of the notes he'd writen post sessions. It's not that they were negative notes necessarily, more that he left out important context, or just flat out misunderstood what I had tried to communicate. I've never expected perfection, but after a few sessions of this happening, I decided to address it with him.

The problem/question is in his reaction. He immediately became exasperated, throwing his body back in his chair, head hanging over the backrest dramatically with a big sigh. He asked why it mattered to me, since he's absolutely positive no one ever reads his notes, even though they are available to every provider within the group/company, and in some legal situations can be obtained through a court order. I explained these things, and that I was also concerned that he was often misunderstanding the points I was trying to make since his notes reflected them inaccurately. He was defensive, frustrated, and continued to press the ""why does it matter?"" question, as if my original reasoning hadn't satisfied him, eventually landing on ""why do you care what people think?"" In what felt like an attempt to redirect the issue to something solely personal. At one point he said ""No other patients actually read their provider's notes(the ones you get a literal email/app notification for when they are posted), that is obsessive and hypervigilant behavior.""

I kept going back to my original reasons, which he responded to by rolling his eyes real hard. I said ""That's really professional."" He responded with ""I don't appreciate the passive aggression."" So I corrected myself and said ""That wasn't very professional."" A few minutes later he asked if he needed to ""write a novel in the notes to make sure I get it all right."" I pointed out that I didn't appreciate his hypocritical passive aggression in that statement, and for several minutes he argued and refused to acknowledge that what he said was unnecessary and indeed passive aggressive. He did end up apologizing for it and for being defensive, but then excused it immediately by saying ""but, if you didn't criticize me(express a concern calmly), I wouldn't have reacted like that."" Then, in a total 180, he's suddenly remorseful and goes for the good ole ""You don't deserve this, maybe I can't help you the way you need."" The timeless classic- ""it's not you- it's me."" 

The session ended with little resolution and a lot of tension. The notes he wrote were some of the most blatantly passive aggressive things that could still be passed off as clinically acceptable, especially if you didn't understand all the hidden/personal jabs he threw in. In concluding the notes, he suggests that in spite of the ""rupture,"" we should keep meeting and try to move past it, but that he doubts that I am invested enough and willing to do so, which felt a little like an attempt to manipulate me into doing just that. As if me ending our therapeutic relationship was a sign of not being invested enough in my mental health, and had nothing to do with the way he acted/reacted. 

TL;DR- psychologist becomes defensive and behaves unprofessionally while blaming it on me being critical of his innacurate notes. Big enough red flag to cut and run, or am I overreacting?

shroomiddit,Scared/nervous to disclose severe trauma to my therapist next session,3,1bnftde,0,"Hello everyone! As the title suggests, I have my next therapy appointment on Thursday and am thinking about sending her an email asking if we can talk about the flashbacks and trauma that's been resurfacing for me recently. I am really scared though and nervous to talk to her about it because I'm afraid of what her reaction will be. The age that what happened for me I'm going to be talking about I was age 10-14, and I still feel slightly responsible for what occured. My mind tells me it's my fault because everyone around me at the time told me that. I'm scared she's going to be judgmental and think differently of me after, even though she's never once been judgmental or made me feel bad about anything we've discussed ever. She's a really great therapist and I do trust her a lot, I'm just scared. I know it's really important to talk to her about it though cause it has been affecting me pretty severely the past couple of weeks.
I guess I'm asking and of course only if you're willing to share, how your experience went with sharing deep rooted trauma with your therapist? I should maybe make it known this won't be my first time telling her traumatic stuff that's occured during my life, but this one I can't really use dark humor for and it's just really really sad to me and I think deeper than some other stuff.

Asterx5,Should I tell my professor that she is the reason I went to therapy,1,1bnoh78,14,"I (23m) have a long history with a professor of mine 46f. From her helping me in my first year but so did I, to promising to write her a novel. To her unknowingly saving my life after a professor told me to end myself.

She left after the first semester but I had never forgotten her and knew I had to visit her one day and be on good terms.

However I had a dream about my grandfather dying on my graduation day. And it happened.

I was left unemployed and depressed living alone with my sick grandmother.

I decided it was finally time to pay my hero a visit after 4 years. It was Ramadan so jt was a religious month for us Muslims. I told her the tale of my grandpa. Said I will visit next month.

Couldn't do because my granny almost died in my arms. We had to leave town. I tried to return to give a part of the novel to the Prof but she wasn't there which made me worried.

I started having visions that she was in some sort of a trouble. One day I had a dream about her mother (someone I never met).

I kept wondering if anything happened to the point it got obsessive. Few months later I return home and bumped into her and turns out it was true. Her mother died, last year her brother too. She had no husband or kids. Completely alone. My brain broke to say the least. I promised her to always visit.

I felt immense sadness and guilt and it took over my life and with other stuff. I had to finally take therapy.
It didn't help and I was just broken.

I visit her where she was welcoming and wanted me to always visit.

I did next week with a gift. Complimented her and told her how much she impacted my life.
She wanted me to be her assistant and I was welcoming this idea as I wanted to help her.

The next month I went but there was an exam 
So we talked for few minutes where I told her I was taking medication and she admitted doing that before. She told me to come 3 days later so we could discuss.

When I went a colleague of her was there and after exactly 2 sentences she got involved in the conversation and started degrading and humiliating me for being unemployed and can't find a job and called me lazy and said she will report me for harassing them if I came again, all while my professor was silent 
And was okay with it too.


I had a breakdown later and would cut my medication. But I still couldn't understand what I did wrong.

Luckily I got a job and I wanted to make her happy and went to tell her, despite acting okay I could feel she didn't care about me because she even refused to give me her email. I didn't even matter to her that much.

Meanwhile I am still dying on the inside and I hid the fact that I dreamt about her mother because I didn't want to hurt her.

Should I go one last time and tell her everything? She explained why she let the other prof talk to me this way while convincing she should have at least said something good about me like she always did.

And the best way I am going to do this is make a list of all my traits/habits instead of typing out a wall of text. I hate the ugliness. But before I begin, my name is James! I am on the spectrum of autism, ADHD, and major depression. I enjoy ant keeping, video games, anime, a tiny bit of hiking when the mood is right, and spending time with what little friends I have.

Now, for the fun part.

*I am a logical thinker, I tend to argue with my friends/gf a lot about what‚Äôs right/wrong. I do not mean to do this, but it‚Äôs impulsive when things do not make sense and I have to correct it.

*I have the ability to read others intentions and their emotions but have the inability to feel said emotions, only going off identifiers.

*I live a very emotionally stagnate life. That‚Äôs of course until I met my gf, she is helping me through it. Me not understanding her feelings put her through a rut that really made me guilty and want change. But until then emotions never really mattered to me since I can just pin out the building blocks of reality and move on with life normally if I were alone.

*I have a constant depressive mood that I combat with weed or keeping myself actively engaged. I do this currently by walking my cats with my gf when she can manage to drag me out of the house. Or I compensate by detailing shopping centers(Current street sweeper)

*I have a huge love for animals and a pretty big disdain for humans and all humans. The innocence of a animal can never be outweighed by a humans. I link this to having been bullied a good majority of my life in the education system and I do see this as a bit irrational but it feels innate.

Negatives

*Situations that are traumatizing for people do not phase me. Actually, it stimulates me and it provides me valuable data depending on the situation because of how rare it probably is.

*Manipulation is a valuable tool for me. I use it well with my ability to read others. If there are any 40k fans out there I absolutely love Horus Lupercal for this trait. I do not do this often as it does leave traces of guilt. I just can‚Äôt help fabricating doors to my own opportunities. 


*I am a huge social chameleon and can put up a facade and absolutely fake emotions and play along with scenarios. A good example is avoiding homelessness by forcibly dating a woman and providing for her until I saw a great opportunity to leave. I treat them with massive amounts of respect and false love to compensate for the lack of the latter.
(Note: I am with someone I do love dearly and she is being treated like a queen)

Recent events in my life have made me realise I have not dealt with things from my past effectively.

I would like to start out by saying therapy is not an option as I cannot afford it in any way shape or form and do not qualify for free help in my country.

I don't feel happy, sad, depressed, angry I feel nothing most of the time but I still have hope for many things.

This is going to be a long read so please be prepared.

Life was good up until 5 years of age, I started primary school in a small rural town here in New Zealand, by the time I started, I was smart, well beyond my years. The school I went to was primarily people of color with me being white, I was ostracized from day 1 and couldn't make any ground on getting other kids to accept me, not just in school but my neighbourhood too, one of my neighbours used ""black magic"" on me and my parents saw a change and did something about it but to this day at 30 years of age will not tell mw what. After this happened we moved to a new city.

I started in my new primary school and due to me being smart I became a target, very early on in my time at that school I started to get beaten up daily and made fun of in class, I would eagerly answer questions and be keen to learn, this very quickly faded as it was always met with ridicule by other kids.

This chain of evens meant I wasnt learning because I was always trying to ignore my bullys and trying to keep myself from being beaten up so year after year I ended up in the same class as my bullys from the previous years, I never caught back as there was always around 5-6 of them and 1 of me, this continued into intermediate school where 6 months into my first year i snapped and tried to stab the main bully in the head with a oair of scissors, i got after school suspension and the bully got nothing.

Things slowed down for a bit after that but quickly picked back up, I developed a big anger problem and would physically fight almost every day with people picking on me to try and get them to stop.

Things carried on getting worse with the beatings being more severe and me already hating life from 7 years old.

This all carries on into highschool where I would just hang out by myself and I had a severe rage and hate for the world as over all these years only one teacher tried to help but was unable to, I sunk into listening to music and ignoring literally everything to do with schooling, picture your typical leather jacket, skinny jeans, doc martens long haired kid with headphones in 24/7 listening to heavy metal and fantasizing about killing all of my school bullys in a torturous way. 

At the age of 15 I was removed from the classroom and put on work prep due to having no academic scoring at all, work prep basically meant I drove around in a van with the care taker up keeping the school and on Wednesday's we would go into the community and do community service at places like the red cross or salvation army.

At age 16 I left high school and decided it was my chance to do better for myself, so I joined an adult learning centre and got all my certificates I could have gotten in school in a matter of 6 months instead of 4 years.

I then moved out of home at 17 and went to university where I fell into drug and drinking and general self destructive behaviour, while I did absolutely enjoy this time and look back on those times as some of the fondest in my life they were also the worst for my health, I went to uni being 6 foot 1 and 80kg, and after 3 years I came home to my parents being 45kg, I got healthier and went straight back to drinking and drugs and was diagnosed with depression, at 21 i overdosed on a bunch of different pills and chemicals in an attempt... I survived and after that is when my emotions went mute, it is hard to explain, I feel them I have empathy for the world and people in it, people tell me I'm one of the kindest most caring people they have met and I will put every one above myself in terms of care, I love animals with a burning passion too but the actual emotions are very dull.

Recently my marriage fell apart all due to my own shortcomings but that's another thing all together. 

After that I met a woman who has started to make me feel things with an intensity I have not felt since I tried my attemp, this is when I realised something has to change, I really care for her, she makes me happy like truly happy, the happiest I've ever been in my life but I need to figure these things out because I'm always in a state of tiredness and not giving a fuck unless it comes to her. 

Part of this is a rant/vent while another is a cry for help I guess so if anyone has insights or comments please, feel free to DM me or comment on this post.",1711366995.0,

**TL;DR version at the end.**

**N.B: as you can see, english is not my first language. Some sentences may not make much sense.**

28 - M - Italian.  
For some extra contenxt I'll briefly summarize my life in case you need some background, before getting to the main point.  
My life has been hard since i remember: chaothic childhood, alchoolic father, parents were fighting a lot to the point to phisically harm themselves in any possible way. When I was 10 they decided break up, so I crossed the obvious unpleasant experience that one goes through in these cases: court, parents who try to have more hope in choosing custody. The atmosphere at home wasn't one of the best, basically.  
As happens in most cases, custody goes to my mother with whom I have lived until now (minus three years, but we'll get there). My father decides to marry another woman and move abroad; I haven't heard from him since. (No paid alimony, obviously).

From that moment on, economically speaking, but not only, it's been a disaster. To the extent that my mother started accumulating debts upon debts. Of course, I thank her for trying not to let me miss anything over these years, but many of her choices have led us to the situation we're in today.

I go through adolescence, and many years thereafter, battling depression, anxiety, dropping out of high school; basically, a snowball rolling down from a mountain.

Fast forward, in 2018 I try to get a grip on my life step by step and as best as I can: I finish school graduating (in computer science), find a job (though not the one I desire, but for the moment, we make do even though I'm working on it), start therapy, and things seem to be going better. I even get my driver's license.

My mother starts having problems with the car too, which ends up being seized administratively becoming unusable. We decide to get a car in my name, at that point it was needed for both of us. Then comes COVID, unfortunately, my company is forced to make cuts in personnel, including me being one of the most recent hires. I manage to pay for the car for a while, but then I'm forced to pass the responsibility to my mother, who not only stops paying the installments but practically becomes her car and not mine anymore. (As of today, I still owe about 8k, which they all want together). Consequently, I ended up on the list of bad payers: this eliminates some tax benefits, not being able to even apply for loans or anything else.

2022 - my mother changes company (always worked in a cleaning company, even now), so she decides to move to be closer to work. At that time, being independent again, I decide to stay in the old house continuing to pay my mother's mortgage. I start to inquire about how to make the payment, discovering that not only the latter, obviously, hadn't been paid for many years by now, but it was already about to go to auction. After two years of hell between having to find a house (prices now inaccessible), commuting between home-work with a 3-hour journey without having the car (by car it's about 30m), a relationship with my ex that slowly fell apart due to stress.

2023 - I find a house, 800‚Ç¨ per month (1400‚Ç¨ salary), impossible to manage alone. My mother goes through more troubles with the new house. I get the unhealthy idea, also pressured by the timer of having to leave home because of the auction deadline, to move back in with her, taking the new house. I talk to her about it, try to set boundaries on expenses, on dividing any expenses, on household chores. I even propose to manage her money. The first two months go as they should, everything seems okay. Until everything goes back to how it was before, where she is always broke and I have to pay for gas and ordinary expenses already a week after her salary. (2/5 of her salary goes towards the aforementioned debts). So, the bills are accumulating again and I can't save anything to theoretically create hope for the future. We've been here for about 8 months now, but I want to save myself before reaching the point of no return as before.

Talking about it is practically impossible, every time I bring up the subject, even trying to remain as assertive as possible, she shuts down, changes the subject, and/or downplays the situation as if it's not as serious as it seems. The relationship between me and her has been dead since I was 14, we barely talk (it was already like this, but the therapist advised me to maintain this approach and interact as little as possible); we live in the same house, but we only see each other for dinner, if I don't decide to eat alone.

My plan was to try to catch up with the bills, even alone, and eventually look for something else: although the only possibility for my finances at the moment, I believe, is to look for a room to share with someone. So, grit my teeth these months, cancel the lease here and look for something else to save myself.

It's a situation that terrifies me and I feel overwhelmed, I can't think rationally, and, as much as it seems like the only solution at the moment, I wanted to make sure I'm not missing any possibilities. So, I ask you if you think it's a possibility to consider or if I'm just emotionally stressed.

It's probably all very confusing, I provided useless and/or incomplete information. I'll answer as many questions as possible, if necessary, and I thank you for your time in reading this long and boring post.

  
**TL;DR version:**

*I'm a 28-year-old Italian man, and I've been through a lot in my life, including a chaotic childhood, parental separation, and ongoing financial struggles. Despite these challenges, I've been trying to make progress step by step.*

*After finishing school and finding a job in computer science, things started looking up. However, setbacks like losing my job due to COVID-19 and accumulating debt from a car loan have made it difficult to maintain stability.*

*Recently, I discovered that my mother hadn't been paying the mortgage on our house, and it was on the verge of foreclosure. This forced me to find a new place to live, adding to the financial strain.*

*Currently, I'm sharing a house with my mother, but our relationship is strained, and she often relies on me financially. Despite my efforts to set boundaries and address our financial issues, communication with her is challenging.*

*I feel overwhelmed and unsure about how to proceed. My current plan is to try to catch up on bills and find a more affordable living situation, possibly by sharing a room with someone else.*

*I'm reaching out for advice and support, as I'm feeling emotionally stressed and unsure if I'm overlooking any potential solutions. Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.*

Anyway most recently I came back from the trip and my bottle of fireball was gone from my mini fridge I had only had one drink from it before I left and I stored it away. My other bottles were still there but the big bottle of fireball was gone, I asked my mom about it she said no and that my step dad doesn‚Äôt drink that and she wouldn‚Äôt either so I ended up asking my friend and he said no and that he doesn‚Äôt like dark alcohol which I‚Äôve seen him drink captain Morgan 100 proof or whatever with his other friends and we actually decided to drink that night the rest of my bottles lol he wanted to and I did too and we had fun ‚Äúcompeting‚Äù in videogames 

my space downstairs is a little messy right now so I‚Äôm holding off on really confronting him/making him replace the bottle. I basically hinted he better hope I find it. I‚Äôm not sure it just makes me REALLY REALLY MAD THAT HE WOULD DO IT AGAIN and like so disgusted too I used to have party‚Äôs where people would steal a lot at so just don‚Äôt let anyone here anymore except him seriously and now something is missing right when I get back from a trip when I know he‚Äôs been here. 

I‚Äôm gonna clean and do all my laundry tomorrow but I‚Äôve looked and this point I don‚Äôt think I can trust him anymore or anybody. But at the same time I‚Äôve done the thing where I‚Äôve misplaced something or forgot where it was and immediately thought ‚ÄúSOMEONE STOLE THIS ‚Äú and I go on and create a whole list of reasons and deductions and I end up deciding this person took it and even though I end up finding it and I‚Äôve done that dozens of times but I don‚Äôt see why I‚Äôd place a bottle anywhere else besides back into my fridge or it‚Äôd be somewhere obvious not it some corner of my room. 

Anyway my point is I‚Äôm probably gonna need to build a thief proof life because I can‚Äôt stand it anymore! Meaning everything organized in a way I know how it was left. Extra locks. Add Cameras and cut these kleptomaniacs off. A locked mini fridge is actually a good solution! Lol! And the way I really feel about this is my gut reaction really thinks he just took it and decided to live a parasitic lifestyle the way he‚Äôs always lived I‚Äôve quite literally told him all he does is appease his own ego in a past argument. And beyond the your my brother act he‚Äôs really just a grubby asshole like most men always taking the high road. He never really did try to be like a good big brother to me it was always like a dirty competition where he tried to put me down and stuff. His petty and jealous nature has most likely made another appearance. And I know he‚Äôs under stress with his father he‚Äôs been paying more then he should be rent wise because his parents are going through a divorce and his moms finally moved out and he‚Äôs losing money  and has to move out and doesn‚Äôt have that kind of money saved and he‚Äôs broke up with his girlfriend a bit ago which I think was important to him it was his first gf he‚Äôs moved in with. And the other suspect is my god mom who was taking care of my mothers dogs. Don‚Äôt think it was her lol. I will update if find the bottle though but yeah I think he took it ngl.",1711362881.0,

Dear Redditors,  
I hope you're all doing well. I'm writing to seek some advice and perhaps gain some perspective on a decision that I've recently made, one that's been weighing heavily on my mind for quite some time now.  
For the past three years, my mother and I have been living with my best friend Ash and her mother Tamara. Initially, it seemed like a great arrangement - a supportive environment where we could all lean on each other during tough times. However, things have taken a drastic turn since Ash's boyfriend Nathan entered the picture.  
Ever since Nathan came into Ash's life, I've noticed a significant shift in our friendship dynamic. It feels like he's managed to drive a wedge between Ash and me, turning her against me in subtle yet hurtful ways. What's worse is that amidst a recent heated argument in the household, Tamara attempted to kick my mother and me out of the house. It was a deeply distressing moment that made me question the solidity of our relationships.  
Throughout all this turmoil, Ash seems more interested in maintaining a relationship with my mother rather than addressing the issues between us. It's left me feeling isolated and unimportant, as if I'm the odd one out in a once tight-knit group.  
After much contemplation and soul-searching, I've come to the difficult decision to move away from Australia to Japan. I believe that distancing myself from this toxic environment is essential for my mental well-being and personal growth. While it's a daunting prospect to uproot myself and start afresh in a foreign country, I'm convinced that it's the right step for me at this point in my life.  
However, I can't help but second-guess myself. Am I overreacting? Should I try harder to salvage my relationships with Ash and Tamara? Or am I justified in prioritizing my own happiness and moving away?  
That's where I turn to you, fellow Redditors, for your insights and advice. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you navigate through it? Do you think I'm making the right decision by moving away, or should I try to resolve things before taking such a drastic step?  
I genuinely appreciate any thoughts or words of wisdom you can offer. Thank you for taking the time to read my story and share your perspectives.

When we first had sex she did mention that it was going to be difficult. It lasted a few minutes before she had to stop. She did say that she was having vivid flashbacks and could see him. She ends up having vivid flashbacks of him where she'll zone out and says she can see and hear him.  How do I go about working through this work her? She doesn't want to be touched when she gets likee this, but yet I want to sit there and hold her and comfort her.  What's the best way to console her? Comfort her? Be there for her?

stargayzingfreak,Anti depressan pros/cons,1,1bn51tc,9,"Hopefully this doesn't count as a ""survey"" as this is for personal use. 

I'm 18F. I am not diagnosed with depression, but I do have chronic depression that coincides with my PTSD diagnosis, as opposed to just seasonal depression and some sadness. To make a long story short, my mental health has been getting worse, or sometimes it's manageable but never *good*. This is making it very hard to keep myself together (I posted here a while ago about it). 

I've wanted to be on anti depressants or anti anxiety meds for a while. I could never get on them because of my mom. But now I'm 18 so I can get a hold of them without her knowing. 

My question is, those who have taken them (preferably people in my demographic), what were some pros/cons you had? I haven't been able to decide if I want them yet. I'm super scared of weight gain as I'm recovering from an ED, and I've heard they can actually make some stuff worse? I'm also worried about losing my sex drive because I do have a boyfriend and whole don't have *sex* sex, we still do some stuff. He said he wouldn't hate me for it and wants me happy but I'm still scared (ironic huh. I want anti anxiety meds lmao).

I will be speaking with my therapist about them next time I see her, but I want some more personal anecdotes. ",1711340855.0,

SizeExtension3785,How to deal with parents that won't accept bounderies?,1,1bn13cu,1,"Hello  
  
My wife recently decided it was time to come out to her very religious parents that she was no longer going to be a practicing Christian herself. Obviously, they were upset by the news and made some comments my wife did not like. My wife, knowing how her parents like to be in control and constantly push limits, also went on to establish the boundary that we were not going to push any sort of religion on our newborn but instead teach him about all religions and let him do as he wishes when he is of a more mature age to understand what it all actually means. If anyone were to violate that boundary they would not be welcome into his life.  
  
Of course, they were less than pleased to hear that. They immediately went into victim mode, saying we are actually the ones being closed minded about this and also saying that while we are adults and can make our own decisions, they do not have to agree or respect those decisions (i.e. they are going to do whatever they please) and tried to turn the situation around as if we don't want them in our lives and we are still welcome to come over whenever we want ( but I guess we would just be subject to them indoctrinating our child if we do??).  
  
2 days later they mailed a package of things to my wife that she had wanted to get from them as well as a letter stating that they decided to mail it since they do not know when they will see us again and if we could find it in our hearts to still send photos of our newborn and us from time to time.  
  
I am at a loss of words at this point on how to console my wife through this. Personally, I feel as though they are incredibly toxic/manipulative people, but at the same time they are her parents and I couldn't even imagine being in her shoes and never seeing/ or communicating with my parents ever again. What's even crazier to me is right before I proposed to my wife, her dad gave me this talk about how important family is to them! I feel awful, my wife feels awful, but we don't think we should stand down due to the complete lack of disrespect. How do we move forward? Do we go full NC, or limited contact? We are planning on refusing delivery on any gifts/packages from them. Personally, I don't want to give them the satisfaction of giving anything to our newborn either, but it doesn't seem fair to him as well.

YoKaiWatchWoFfan,How to deal with little cousins and mom?,1,1bn04ny,0,"Every other week on Sunday (today) me (f15) and my parents (m and f 44) babysit my cousins kids (my second cousins, m2 [We‚Äôll call B], f7 [we‚Äôll call A]) . Now A, we are positive have AdHd, because no matter what we do and how tired she is, she is always bouncing off the walls and it drives me and my mom crazy, even my dad sometimes, but he is a patient man. Now A also has a learning disability, she can‚Äôt spell at all, and always asks how to spell this, or how to spell that, when they are the simplest words, she doesn‚Äôt even try to do things sometimes, I think she may have autism, but I can‚Äôt speak whether she does or doesn‚Äôt because I can‚Äôt even get myself tested for autism.


Now B, is the cutest baby, but he also has problems taking up the same bad habits as A, his sister who he spends going ‚Äúmonkey see, monkey do‚Äù. And it sucks for me and my mom. My mom gets really stressed when A just asks for one thing after another, always asking for something, one thing after another. She takes a lot of anger out on A, but a lot of the time she takes it out on me, yelling at me for something A does. I try to handle it myself, taking whatever my mom tells at me, taking it to my brain and processing what I did wrong in the stituation: I didn‚Äôt help her and she had to my mom; I couldn‚Äôt do it so asked my mom; I can‚Äôt entertain A so she bugs my mom. Everything A does wrong I blame myself, even if it‚Äôs the one time my mom doesn‚Äôt yell at me and tells at A, I still feel like I‚Äôm the one who should be yelled at. 
I ask myself every week they‚Äôre here, ‚ÄúHow am I not in therapy?‚Äù Because I‚Äôve dealt with yelling all my life, between my parents to between my mom and my siblings, I heard everyone in my family yelling at eachother. I remember so well in my memory a time where I was hiding in my parent‚Äôs room when they were yelling at my brother, I hate showing my fear or sadness or worry to my family, cause they think I‚Äôm the only ‚Äúnormal‚Äù child they have. I go into this depressive state every other Sunday when my cousins are here, because I relive those memories again and again. But I have no one to blow my steam off on, because I‚Äôm not allowed to show weakness.


And I don‚Äôt even know if therapy is an option for me, because I can‚Äôt just talk about my problems, I tell myself over and over I have none, and that I am fine, because compared to some situations my friends have been in, I‚Äôm in heaven. Except I never told anyone about my problems, no one, because I have no problems and I‚Äôm never depressed. I mask myself to my family, even when my true side (a happy go lucky person) shows through, I still have these memories deep inside that seep out in times like these.
I‚Äôm sorry if this is a vent, or I went off topic, it‚Äôs just I‚Äôve just been bottling up my emotions for years now, and it‚Äôs hard.
Thanks for reading my vent, and I hope others have better stories than this.",1711326127.0,
