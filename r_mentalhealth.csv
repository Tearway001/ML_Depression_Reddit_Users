Floooraaa1,No one thinks im pretty. I dont want to live as my ugly self anymore,31,1c69l4s,20,"Of Course i (18/f) got some compliments as a child but i would say at 8+ i never heard from anyone that im pretty. Not even my own family. Im not even mad, im ugly. Thats just it. 

My male friends werent allowed to have girls over for sleepovers. So my friends asked me to send pictures of myself, because after seeing how ugly i am their parents schouldnt worry anymore.
Its a running gag to call me fat all the time. (Im about 180ibs). 
No one ever wanted more from me, everyone just makes fun of me. 

What kind of a life is that? Im so sick of always being ""the nice girl'. I just want one person to say that im pretty ans actually mean it but that wont happen.

Last month there was a creep while i was walking down the street. He was over 60 and disgusting, wanted my number. Still i felt good after at least SOMEONE thought im somewhat attractive.

CountingWonders,Ableism is everywhere.,9,1c680is,2,"I’m autistic.

My diagnosis is becoming a slur.

People are making it a joke.
People make me a joke.
People avoid the subject intentionally knowing what they have done.

Society supports this sort of ableism.

I never heard the word  ableism for so long to the extent I thought it weren’t actually a word and it was the last hateful thing I learned about (As such as homophobia, sexism, etc…)

People have hated me for autism.

Autism is treated like a ‘benefit’ in some cases, the liars are treated better than we are. There is far too much in this all.

Society discriminates against people like me.
Society lies.


I’m tired of it, I’m tired of being the ass of this society. Why is this our society? One of which lies about as such as bullying, sexism, ableism, racism and such being little to gone when it merely grew ‘unpopular’ and more overly subtle?

I mean, sure, things have changed and I’m glad, it’s just so many other things have merely been masked from my perspective.

Why does society hate autism? They’ll never say it straight to our faces most of the time when we seek it, why? Is this a mere losing game? A lost cause?",1713355236.0,

dilu_w,I can't stand how much i hate myself,4,1c6c67l,2,"I stare at the mirror and I can't see myself. I can't look at my body. I cry when I shower and I look down at my body. I've always been a fat kid and my self-steem has always been low, but I can't stand it anymore. The fact that i'm agender (afab, he/him) makes it all worse. I have terrible dysphoria over my body. Over my chest, specially. 

I'm always treated different. I never receive compliments. If I'm with my friends, people always tell them how pretty they dress and look. I stand next to them, and i'm not even perceived. I know I don't dress pretty. I try to hide my body as much as I can, no matter if it's summer. I know i'm not the prettiest. If I know something, is that i'm kind and patient and I know i'm a good friend. But that's not important to people, apparently. 

Everytime I wear a short-sleeved t-shirt, I'm worried my arms are visible over my elbow. I can't stand my arms. I can't stand my legs. I hate my body to such a point that the only thing I like are my selfharm scars. I hate dressing myself up, I feel it's worthless. I feel I look terrible in everything.

The only ways my body has been treated, is in a sexual or hateful way. Or maybe I don't believe when people tell me ""your body is perfect"", because I know it's not. I'm tired. I'm exhausted. No matter what I do I can't lose weight (i have PCOS). I just want to hide myself.

Chubbyfun23,44m feeling stuck,3,1c6exkc,0,"I've read posts on here and I thought my life was bad but there's a lot of people here who are doing worse than me. I feel for you all. That being said, I'm still struggling here and don't really have an outlet so I guess I just wanted to vent some. I don't have people I can really talk to. I grew up abused and hated by my family because I'm bisexual, so they're not really in the picture anymore. The relationship I do have with them is only because I reach out them and try. I was kicked out as soon as I was 18 and I moved out of state after attempting to be in the military. I've been here 24 years and they've never called me. All of my friends growing up abandoned me when I came out and I have just not trusted people very much since all that. I have a handful of friends but none of them are like close BFF types, more like acquaintances. I'm 44 now and have grown into a pathetic type of introvert. I don't like being seen by people because I find conversation dreadful and I come across as rude and have been called stuck up by almost everyone. The reality is I'm just horribly uncomfortable and socially awkward.

I'm single currently after a 7 year relationship with a guy older than me. He's like worlds smarter than me too and always made me feel dumb, but not intentionally. It's just almost a spectacle to watch someone that much smarter than you. I couldn't keep up. The good times we had together were really good. I'm living with my ex who is now a pretty cold person at times. Most of the time we're friendly but that's not someone I can't really rely on to talk to. We chose to live together because the cost of houses has gone up dramatically as well as interest rates. So it's just cost effective to stay where we are. The house we're in shot up in value too so neither of us can easily buy the other out. I don't have 350k sitting around and neither does he. So I also feel trapped at the moment. I recently lost my job to top it off. I was laid off through no fault of my own. Just the company wasn't doing well. I don't think it will be that hard to find work but it's been a week only so we'll see.

My life just feels stuck and I don't know how to fix that. I'm lonely and everything feels so hopeless. I have faith and observe Judaism. I converted to it. But lately that hasn't brought me any comfort either. Watching the world burning and watching people dying all over the place is not helping either. We live in some crazy times and instead of people uniting, we're dividing.

Recently I met a really nice girl on here. She reached out to me and wanted to talk, so we talked. And we talked some more and for a while I was becoming happy again but she's gone silent, like you would expect from a redditor. I don't know if I said something wrong or what. She told me she loved me and it took me a long time to say it back because I tend to guard myself. Of course I said it and now she's gone. Now I'm just back to being alone and looking for a way to lift my soul back up. I'm sad all the time. I cry a lot lately. I just don't seem to have any hope. I'm getting older, I thought I'd have a kid or two by now. Of course dating men isn't helping that but I've tried and tried with women and they don't seem to like me. Men beat the door for me and love me madly so it's just easier to date men. But I don't want to date men. I haven't wanted to date men for so long.

I know my life isn't horrible and I'm trying to look for ways to remain positive. I'm just not seeing anything. I feel like my life has no meaning or purpose. I have no real impact on anybody and nobody has a real impact on me. If I died today nobody would notice.",1713372848.0,

throwawayaccount-381,I'm almost cured of OCD because of my depression and this shocked my doctors.,2,1c6grso,0,"I had severe OCD from when I was a teen. It started off one fine day when I started getting afraid of not washing my hands. It escalated to being a germaphobic, having repetitive behaviours, doing weird things because if I don't do it, I would dye, obsessive and compulsive thoughts. Life started getting extremely hard and got worse when my parents dropped me in the middle of a forest where my college was. It was one of the dirtiest colleges I'd ever seen and I completely lost my mind. 

I fell into severe depression and things started changing from then. I stopped doing my rituals because I thought if I stopped doing it, I would finally be unalive. I stopped being a germaphobic because I wanted the germs to infect me so that I could to the other side faster. My health anxiety went away because now I did not need a reason to live. 

Things started getting better when it came to my OCD because now, I started having lesser symptoms. I cannot completely avoid being a germaphobic or stop having rituals because it has always been a part of me but it is extremely rare now. 

When certain doctors where put to consult me, they were going crazy over my case because apparently they'd never seen anything like it. I was like those complicated riddles no one wishes to have because they're so complicated to manage. It honestly made me feel alone because when they do not have an idea about my illness, no one would understand me. No one would be able to treat me properly.

CounterElectrical395,Why my social best friend is changed suddenly? Also acting weird and rude,6,1c68whl,2,"After College My best friend isolated himself completely and behaving rudely with whoever contacting him. 

One of my best friend isolated himself and not communicating with any friends over call. Plz help

So my male classmate since 5 years graduated few years back aged 26.
His name is Veerya. He used to be very energetic, outgoing, bold, everybody used to like him because of his vibe. Some girls also had crush on him due to his social behaviour.

(Recently i came to know about his personal life problem that his father used to be abusive since childhood and drunker, fiend. and he went to classmates house and complained about Veerya. His father said he is mentally ill boy and thrown him out of his own house ) so his father clearly wanted to damege his image because of the fight. Veerya seperated his father to protect his mother. And his father went totally nuts with destroying his image. His father is so weild and bad person.

While in college My friend never mentioned about his personal life problems. He came to know about his father's doing these things behind his back.

After completing of college life he completely distanced himself from all the friends , including female friends. Also left Whatsapp group, all social media accounts. Etc. 
He didn't pick anyone's call. And completely ignored. I think he felt so embarrassed because of his Father's behaviour. And isolated from outside social Circle.

So in our all the old friends meetup, hangout trips. He is the only guy ubsent. I can't even go to visit his home personally. Because I knew he will not like it.

It's been 7 years. No contact. I still miss him and cherish those old memories in which he made me feel so special. And happy.

So yesterday our mutual female friend contacted him in messaging, he was rude to her(but he used to be very nice and decent boy) he sent her vulgur memes, extreme sexual  content. Which led her to block him.

Plz help me what should I do as a friend? 
Why such nice person behaving like this. I am really concerned about him.

Why he sent her such content?

toothlesstheunknown,Extreme Homicidal Fantasies ,2,1c6dosb,6,"!!Additional trigger warning but mentions of extreme violence in fantasies!!
I just got out of a conversation with a crisis line worker about this so mini rant/ looking for resources.

I've always experienced homicidal and violent fantasies, I've never acted on them- I never so much as raised my voice. Any anger and aggression was kept locked inside.
For the past 8 years it's been simple. Just kill them. The who always changed, the how mostly stayed the same. Either stab them to death and cut them open or beat them over the head with a hammer and splatter their brain matter over the walls. In either scenario it's done in the victims sleep, in their own house and bed.
Lately though, the past three weeks it's taken a more sadistic route. It would be abducting and keeping them, taking it slow and making sure they're conscious right up until they take their last breath. I'd film it. Cut them open, beat them, anything. I want to be in control. I want them to fear me. I'll film it. I don't think I would distribute the videos. I'd keep them on CDs for my own use. Sometimes there's a sexual aspect to it. Not always though. Lately though it's felt more than a fantasy, it excites me. Raises my pulse, similar to excitement or adrenaline. It causes a groinal response and just a full body reaction.
Like it's something I genuinely want to act on. I won't. Any enjoyment wouldn't cancel out the punishment so it would all be for nought. 
More than anything I just want any sort of advice about why I'm like this and how I can get a better handle on it. I don't know how to seek help out. ",1713369888.0,

Alternative-Rub6623,The mind of a sadist,8,1c64s1t,7,"I rarely feel guilty, most of the time i feel that people deserve to be hurt (mentally). I.e, if someone hurts me, they deserve to get hurt the same way but worse if that makes sense. I feel some people can’t understand unless it’s done to them. I look at it as a game even. Like any time someone does something hurtful or disrespectful to me, i see it as them moving their chess piece. Then i’ll make my move and hurt them as well. Even if they do it unintentionally, or intentionally, I tend to think strategically about it; what can I do to make them feel the same pain as me, and waiting out enough time so that they forget what they did to me, therein, when I do it in return, it hurts worse for them because they don’t see the motive. If you pay back the pain too quickly, they may just see it as you doing it out of pettiness. 
    I haven’t always been this way though, I used to be very loving, very caring of every one and overly sensitive to every little thing. I got beat into this way. I had no choice but to turn out like this. It wasn’t planned but I was practically self taught, from experience that you can only care about yourself, and trust no one. Now with this mindset I get hurt a lot less. I may hurt others, but life was never fair to begin with. It is what it is quite literally.
     Do I want to stay like this? I’m not sure. I miss who I was sometimes, but when I think about it I was just a piece of gum stuck on the floor getting stepped on by everyone, until it was flattened. 
     Don’t think i’m some assh*le who is mean to everyone for no reason. No, i’m not an evil person, though i’m not good either. I just try to be fair in every way possible. Remember what they say, treat others the way you want to be treated. Or as I like to think, treat others how they treat you. Whether they treat me with love and respect or not, they’ll always get the same in return.

I would also get bullied at school. My 'friends' would just watch it happen and do nothing. They wouldn't hang out with me either so I was isolated. Then I also got sexually assaulted by my sister.

Fast forward 6th grade, when I joined a new school I hallucinated for mere seconds I won't get into detail but I said some weird stuff. I hallucinated again for some moments in the 7th grade.

The in form 2 at church, it happened again for a couple of moments. I was asking 'for help' , but my church mates didn't believe me.

Then  in form 3 some time before covid I had a full on psychotic break for a month. I would see demons ,I would still go to school but I would sometimes bump into walls and say stuff like my church elders sexually abused me. (They didn't)

Why didn't I receive help? My family and classmates thought I was pretending. My sister is a medical student she said she asked a psychologist and they said I'm pretending, that I don't need to go seek help.

But I still didn't believe that because I do believe I was sick. I have never malingered a day in my life, unless pretending to be sick to avoid school counts eg having a cold or fever. To that I say who hasn't done that before.

Fast  forward till now, I managed to get in contact with a psychologist and told them  what happened. They believed me and said that I need to get a consultation with them to  understand what happened. But I don't have the money to go yet, the consultation is expensive. 


So its so difficult to live with to live with my family  cause I have to deal with turmoil of fighting for myself.  And I even doubt my memories sometimes.


This isn't even the full story, I have been through so much abuse.


But I don't even know anymore.

For background information I (21F) got cheated on several times by my ex partner around a year ago.

Now, i have this incredibly new partner, that really wants the best for me, treats me so nicely and is in general stable, if that makes sense.

Here starts the problem. One second I am overly obsessed with them, feeling like the luckiest girl in the world and all i could do is think about them and the very next second I just want to be on my own. Break up and run away. I feel drained and overwhelmed and everything just feels too much. 
You should’ve seen the face my therapist made after i told her. I was dealing with a lot of stuff from my mom and my ex partner, and i am in therapy for almost 4 years. I feel like all the progress I’ve made just vanished after my ex cheated on me.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, its so difficult to explain, i just wished my brain would let me sort my thoughts for once, but as soon as it’s quiet i can’t figure out, why i feel one second like this and the very next second like that. These up and downs are hella draining.

EvelyneRe,Feeling like an intruder in people's lives ,22,1c5x9v4,9,"I don't know how to explain this properly so I hope my point comes across somehow

Lately I've been stuck on this feeling. It's so awful it feels so uncomfortable. I feel like I don't fit in at all or rather people get bored of me so easily even tho I put so much effort to talk and engage with people even tho they tell me how nice and caring I am I can't help but think it's all just for show they just say that so they don't appear rude. 

This feeling only got stronger when I realised that my friends in uni only come to me when they need someone to vent or to give them cash it's like I'm only an ATM and a therapist at this point but when I need someone to help they don't bother or rather don't even try or pretend to care. 

This goes even into my family relationships, ever since I was little I felt like an intruder in the house, I was a self sufficient child mom never had to look after me since I did everything by myself. They never ask they never care about me as a person it's only when they need me in something that then they start acting diffrent on top of that my mom specifically is close to my brother and sister even when I try to get closer to her I'm only met with resistance it's like she doesn't even want me here. 

I don't get what's so wrong about me that they disregard me so much? I've done everything I was supposed to yet it still doesn't make sense to me how they r close and I'm just there, an outcast.

Zestyclose_Dig_5048,Feels like my life has been turned upside down.,1,1c6gp0m,0,"Hi,

I'm a 41M. A few months ago I quit my high paying career due to burn out and wanting to spend more time with my partner at weekends. I got a part-time job with a minimum wage, plenty of flexibility to study and very little accountability.

I chose to go back to school and study for an IT cert and it was great. I was finally free to follow my dream of working with computers and I was financially in a position to do so.

Then we split up.

The one thing I had which nobody could take from me was my work ethic and drive. And I know that it was still the right thing to do as I may never have left that career without her. But I'm lost. I've lost the part of me that I worked so hard for. And now I'm on this journey alone, working in a part time job and living with my parents again.

Every day I consider going back to my previous role. But I know that isn't the answer. I need to keep pushing with the studies and stick to the plan.

My fears:

I'll never meet anyone again as I'm 41 and earning potential likely to be low for a while (that's irrational?).
I'll fail and end up back where I started in 5 years.
I'll never own a home (we were saving and close) but by the time I'm earning enough I'll be too old.
I've massively fucked up.

My friends and family support my decision to retrain.

I'm currently in counselling for anxiety.

I don't know if I can do this alone.

KunGa69,Please help me,1,1c6gjuc,0,"Honestly, this is gonna sound really weird to everyone, but every time I masturbate my personality and the way I act changes. I've done research to see if I can find an answer but nothing I find helps. This is affecting me mentally as I keep changing each time, and I'm finding it hard to stop.

I'll give an example, one day I was really happy and made good jokes, and the next after I masturbated I felt empty and the way I came across was different until I masturbated again, where it either made me happier or emptier. Another thing I notice is that my memory also gets very cloudy after and I find it hard to remember things and retain information. As a student who is studying for their final exams, this is a struggle for me.

I believe that this theory started when I was younger. I noticed that the way I acted was different after masturbating and I thought that it was a good thing, thinking that if I didn't act the way I wanted, I could just ""reset"" and try again. This theory has adapted over the years and has become embedded into my mind, and I can't get rid of it.

To most people, this sounds completely ridiculous, but for me, it's affecting me mentally in a way that's hard to explain to anyone else. If anyone had an answer to why this may be happening then please let me know as anything would be helpful.",1713376740.0,
crackedspinach,whats intrusive thoughts a sign of?,1,1c6gifg,1,"tw: s/h, violence

ive always had pretty mild intrusive thoughts and brushed it off, but for about nearly a year now theyve gotten more disturbing. It's not like i want to act on them, they disturb me and i just want help.

They started off when i was around 14 and were things like ""i want to cut myself"" or ""what if i just jumped in front of this car right now?""
Around my 16th birthday however they started getting worse. Different phases of thoughts will come and go but examples are stuff like gutting someone like a fish, ripping a hole in my cheek or stabbing my eye. They honestly disturb me and make me feel like im going fucking insane.
I had a therapist through public services since i cant afford private for around 3 months until she decided i was ok enough and close enough to low risk and then discharged me.
She did ask if i had intrusive thoughts, i said yes and she didnt care to question any further about them and at the time i wasnt confident about being open with anyone so i didnt bring it up myself.
I have suspicions that i have bipolar2 but i havent been diagnosed and dont even know how id go about it and dont know if intrusive thoughts like this are part of bipolar2 or something else. The thoughts arent specific to any type of mood episode they happen with both depressive and hypo.

I promised myself that after primary school, I am going to never be with someone who is controlling towards me and toxic. I don't have any school friends even 7 years later. Though I have 2 friends whom I really love. I was rather lonely and being laughed at, at school. But I was building up my personality and grew more confident of myself even though I was really insecure. I finally got a sense of myself with what I like, what my goals are in life and how I am.

This is what I learned by having opinions and having a sense of my own thoughts. THATS NOT RIGHT AT ALL! IT'S NOT GOD WORDS AND IT COULD SCREW YOUR LIFE!! EITHER I AM CONTROLLED IF I FOLLOW OTHERS BLINDLY WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT OR I FEEL LONELY AND ANXIOUS IF I FOLLOW MY OWN PATH!! I AM ALSO CONTROLLED BY THE MEDIA IF I JUST LIKE SOME OF IT. I know the fine line between fiction and reality. Seriously I read creepypastas. Those are non fictional horror telling stories.

ActiveAmbitious6686,I am not a good person,1,1c6fnkw,0,"
Throughout my life I have spent most of my time coasting through life, not taking anything seriously and most stuff that I am good at just came naturally to me, I don’t work for it. I have been so blessed in my life with overwhelming support from my family. I could do whatever I wanted (within reason) as long as I maintained good grades in school. Instead of working for those grades, I would do anything to get good grades, cheat, lie, take advantage of nice people to get the answers etc. In college I was a leach, I latched onto a few friends who carried me through school. I benefitted from covid-19 online schooling and allowed cheat sheets for exams. All so I could obtain a degree that would look so good and flashy to other people, I thought I was the greatest. I sacrificed a lot of relationships to be able to obtain this degree, it made me miserable working for this, but I thought hey it will just get better at work, not at all.

Now that I’m in the real world I’m realizing what a terrible person I am. I started off wanting to be this greater worker do anything for the company, work my ass off for something and do it. I felt like the smartest guy like I knew everything right when I started working there. But after awhile I realized I know nothing. I quickly got burnt out, I thought if something was wrong or off it was my fault or a mistake that I made. Instead of just asking the question and now if anything gets remotely hard I fold like a lawn chair. I don’t ask the appropriate questions in fear of looking dumb and I act like I know everything when I really don’t. The work I’m putting out is terrible and my mindset is terrible when trying to learn. I don’t take teaching/coaching well, it feels like when someone is teaching me something I’m either 1.) too good or know it already or 2.) feel it is a strike at my ego because I don’t know it. I have this weird comparing myself to other people attitude because I am so insecure about myself. I’m overly self aware to my surroundings and how people view me. When just talking to people at work they just give me this blank stare like why tf did we hire this guy. I’ve never been the greatest communicator I fall back on dirty jokes, belittling myself and sports for topics of conversation. In the real world, you can’t talk the way that I do and find comfort in talking about. Which is hard for me to understand and cope with. I never realized how entitled I am until I started this job and realize I have made no personal connections with people. I expect this to be like school where I get gratification in the sense of obtaining a grade for something. But not getting that grade back, getting that high of seeing a good score or seeing that shit score and knowing I need to buckle down has been a tough adjustment. 

I am realizing that I have serious issues that I need to work on and I have started to go to counseling to help mitigate some of my problems, however I feel like I’m just going in there complaining and not taking any actual action. I have had some dark thoughts about life and I have gone to some dark mental places since starting this job. I know people are going to read this and think what an entitled pos, and you are completely right. I have a supportive family, friends and girlfriend, but I can’t pull myself out of this. I just need some guidance on what I can do to get out of this. What are some things that you have done that have gotten you to a place where you feel comfortable in yourself and changed the things you didn’t like about yourself.

SMB000752,How to slow down an impending mental breakdown? Or let it happen? ,1,1c6fl46,0,I (28F) and my fiancé (26F). This may seem like a silly question but I am completely serious. My partner seems to be on the verge of a mental breakdown. I have been trying to get her into a doctor or counselor for months and months and I cannot convince her to get help and at this point she seems to be either days or weeks away from a serious mental breakdown. By breakdown I am referring to serious hospitalization at a minimum and potentially long term hospitalization if needed. She’s been dealing with an extreme amount of stress and has been coping with it very very poorly. I’m not saying this to judge her it’s simply the truth. She’s dealing with chronic pain issues that we are trying to deal with right now but that’s very slow going as well. No amount of talking about it together seems to make any difference long term and things are quickly getting worse. She’s having mini emotional breakdowns daily at this point. I am honestly lost as to what to do now besides support her and take her to the hospital if a full on breakdown happens. I guess my main question is this - is it possible to slow down a mental breakdown or stop it until I can get her help? Or should I simply support her through it and help her pick up the pieces after? I’m so lost and I don’t know how to help her right now. I have bad mental health as well but I am actively being treated and am well managed at this point.

What makes it worse is I tried to at least get a reason for why she would want to be alone and she says “she doesn’t know” that’s all she’s said to me, she’s dragging me by strings and I feel like I’m about to explode, I’m extremely depressed since this is the happiest I’ve ever been and I wish I could just end it but I know I’ll just pass guilt onto my mom and into her life, the last text I got from her was “I’m sorry to hear you feel like that” to my message saying “I feel like I’ve lost my family you’ve been everything to me and you’ve got no remorse for how I feel” 
She said she wanted to be alone but has turned her location off and is now “staying at a friends house” it’s like she wants me in pain. And I really want it clear that me and her have been so good lately the day before she broke up with me we was looking at holidays abroad she said she was gonna propose to me on the next leap year how can you plan something like that and up and leave with “I don’t know” I’ve not slept in 4 days because I knew something was up I’ve not eaten without throwing it back up. And I’ve got nobody to talk to I’ve got no socials I’ve got her and now I don’t even have that she said she doesn’t know when I can call or when I can text or when I can see her. I’m done with it all. 



(Edit): I’ve also worked so hard on myself for her I pretty much changed everything I could to make us work I saw our lives together and I wanted to make it work. All I’ve ever wanted is her happy and I’m putting myself through hell still trying to Support and show her how much I care and no matter what  I’ll be a home for her. But where has my home gone, I feel lost with no map and I’m drowning without water.

pinkflowerprincessx,I have either become a jealous person or have extreme paranoia due to my ocd.. It's really affecting me and making me feel toxic. ,1,1c6f8hh,0,"To keep it short compared to my others posts on this topic (lol) I basically have an extreme fear of either copying someone, even just taking inspo from someone I feel like they'll accuse me of copying them and my *new* ego also doesn't like to ""copy"" / take inspo from certain people...  Oh and another thing is I plan to start doing x and y, and my brain doesn't want certain people to do it before me... It's super toxic and not how I used to be and idk if that's due to ocd too :(

It's to the point if someone mentions something, I feel I can't do or get that thing because they may think that, or maybe I am copying them (even though logically I know I just like this *thing*) and it's like my brain just associates that thing, or activity with *them* so it kind of ruins it for me you know?

 Imagine you're doing your favourite hobby and your brain keeps thinking of someone else because they mentioned that too? Yep, this is what I have to deal with. And it's constant! It's been going on for over a year or so.

 Last year my ocd was so bad, but I was experiencing a different theme and it kept changing when I got over one thing.. Now this, I fear ill never be able to heal from this :( my brain is in some habit of doing this and it tortures me. 

I'd really appreciate any advice on this, a reality check (however I am starting to think this is all reassurance seeking??) but I'm also not sure if it's ocd :/ I remember exercising something similar where my brain wouor associate a horrible time to a certain object etc, it was the exact same as this. Maybe that was ocd too... I don't hear anyone talk of experiencing the same as me so it's very isolating. ",1713373573.0,
LyoshaOsgood,"My gf keeps saying awful things about herself and is not willing to get help. I'm shaking rn because of a text convo we had and its awful, I feel awful",1,1c6f7ph,1,"

She says things almost every day, i support her almost every day, I do everything to support her. Now she kept on and on about ways to commit suicide and made jokes about it. I know that she can do something like than under emotions and I am emotionally drained from supporting her over and over again without receiving it back. Here's what we had after she stopped texting about ways one can commit suicide:

Me: It's not funny, not even a bit, it's just fucked up,
I do not know what to answer.

Gf: Sorry. Well, I'm not thinking about myself at all when I say this. I'm just thinking about situations like this. Like how does this even happen.

Me: I'm scared anyway because of this, I'm scared for you

Gf: But it made me laugh because the ceiling would fall off if someone hanged themselves...

Me: It's not funny in this context

Gf: Well, the humor is different

Me: I'm scared of it anyway.

Gf: These are just words into the void. And nothing else. Don't take every word I say seriously. It will always be clear when I'm serious and when I'm not. But if I talk about it seriously, then even that won't be serious, because I just won't say it. When I talk about it so openly, it means only one thing. It's all like spitting into the void. And nothing more

I remember telling her one time about the same thoughts. One single fucking time, I hoped for support or just a simple 'it's gonna be okay', but she broke down and then blamed me for even saying this thing, she said: 'you know what reaction I get from these messages, why would you even say it? What was I supposed to say?'. And now when I already told her a few times that talks like that that go one end about her having a monolog is making me scared and shaky. Maybe I'm dumb for thinking it's wrong on her end, I have no idea what to think. I feel like an idiot after she explains why she says certain things.

How conversations didnt flow normally with me. And all that kept bugging me.

 It was because I was closed off from everybody for so long, didnt make friends nor did I bothered to. Was an absolute dick to everybody. Treated people like shit and never shared any personal information with my friends. I think I had forgotten how to. And I hate myself for making my ex feel that way too. 

I have been working on myself. My issues with communication, making friends, being considerate. I did a lot of self reflection in the past month. Also the mistakes I made, which ultimately led to the breakup. My issues with boundaries and respect. I had to gain them again for myself.

Brilliant-Dress-3364,"I think I’m Depressed but I’m not sad (M, 21)",2,1c69e5j,3,"I’ve experienced the “typical” depression before, where I’ve felt super sad, discouraged, overwhelmed, and overall depressed. But within the last 6-8 months I think I’ve been in another depression without actually feeling “depressed”. 

Obviously there are bad days and good days just like anybody, and overall I feel like I’m in a good happy mood, I’ve been able to find faith in God and figure out my own beliefs the last couple years, and I would say I’m really good at being spiritual and grateful for what I have and taking time out of my day to acknowledge my blessings. I live alone but I love living alone, I have a couple friends that I can always rely on that have been my friends for 7+ years, and my relationship with my family is better than it’s ever been.

The reason I think I’ve been depressed though is because I just don’t care about much anymore, I used to be huge into the gym to the point where I was basically bodybuilding, got really big and lean and I loved every part of it, the training, the dieting, tracking calories, and I did all that for years straight. But I don’t even care to go to the gym anymore, I don’t care about my calorie intake, and I’ve only been in the gym maybe 5 days in the last 30 days (Im 6’ 1” used to be 225 lbs but now I’m 195ish) and my family has even noticed my weight change and commented on it. It’s so weird to me because it was my life and all of a sudden I don’t care at all about it.

I’ve been dating a girl for over a year, but the last 5 months I genuinely haven’t given a fuck about her. I don’t care to hangout with her, I just don’t talk to her anymore, I just don’t care. It always seems like I’d rather just smoke weed and sit on my phone (I’ve been smoking for the last 4 years so that hasn’t changed)

But I overall just don’t care or have passion into self growth or actually going and doing anything, but I’m always having fun with myself and in a good mood, but feel guilty for not improving, and I feel like I’m becoming a loser but It doesnt bother me enough to do anything about it.

I could go into more detail but I’ve anyone knows what this is like or can relate, let me know if there is something I can do. I just want to be motivated again to get up everyday and become a better person.

dinolight101,"Images, sounds, smells take me to places and make me feel emotions that aren’t mine.",1,1c6em2x,0,"I am coming here as a last resort of finding someone who has similar experiences or understanding on what I am experiencing.
This is hard to explain, so I will try my best. I have many worlds inside of me and they sometimes confuse me, because what I am experiencing isn’t genuinely the emotions I feel. Something as simple as a smell will send me into images and feelings in my head that I haven’t experienced, so it isn’t Deja Vu. For example if I think about driving past a certain street, I get this feeling of dread, loneliness, pink bedrooms, pina colda, breakups and feeling lost. Or if I am in certain lighting it brings me to this mental place of being in my father’s doorway and I associate it with thanksgiving, Ted Bundy, eerie atmosphere and death. These examples might sound stupid, but they consume my whole life to the point of not knowing if the emotions I feel when I think of these things are real. Sometimes I get scared thinking they are predictions of the future and that’s what scares me a lot. But some parts of these worlds I have also have been experienced before. I am a highly sensitive person if that would help with any explanation. 
This all started when I was in 7th grade as a coping mechanism to escape my parents arguing. I took myself to these worlds of fields, emergency rooms, brown hallways and drug addiction. But these worlds are not real. Over the years they have continued to grow and grow into multiple different worlds to the point of I barely get the chance to experience MY world because I am so overwhelmed by these false worlds.

I have never felt so terrible in my life more than the week I wasn't able to refil my seroquel, and it took me months to recover after re-dosing.

And it's like these pharmaceutical companies chalk it all up to your previous mental illness relapsing. But I know for a fact it is withdrawal from these powerful meds, after all the stories I've read online sharing similar experiences. 

With some people ending up in the hospital. But the staff not re-dosing them or even looking for the possibility of it being withdrawal on their anti-psychotic because there is basically no official evidence of there being withdrawal of it.

Jwoodwinstheday,Not sure what to do ,1,1c6dsnm,0,"Hey there everyone, the post I’m writing has to deal with a problem that has come up recently. 

I’ve recently graduated from college, and me and my current partner have just moved into our first apartment together. Our life at home has been going just fine, and we genuinely enjoy our time together. The one issue that bothers me the most is the fact I have no money. 

I’ve tried to alleviate this by getting a temporary job in the meanwhile while looking for jobs pertaining to my field. However, I know that as some point I’m just going to leave this temporary job because it’s not something I can stand doing. 

The temporary job is for a political campaign, and I am “canvassing” for it. So in short I go to specific houses of voters and ask them questions about their voting plans. Not to hard in residential neighborhoods, but when we have rural houses my heart is almost beating out of my chest. 

I don’t feel bad that I get anxiety from this. I feel bad because I don’t always go to houses, and I will just mark them as nobody is home on our app. I’ve had a so-so work ethic my whole life, and it’s something I’ve always felt insecure about. I’ve always felt on edge and extremely tense at every job I’ve ever had.

My partner is supportive in trying to find me a job in my field. I’m grateful for them, but I feel like I let them down when I have this work/money issues. I’d like to think once I find something in my field I will start to feel better about myself, but deep down I’m not entirely sure. 

It makes me feel terrible that I can’t stomach just doing a temporary job to provide for my family. When I see people work somewhere for 30 plus years I genuinely can’t believe it. I’m not sure if all this makes me a bad guy, I’d like to think I try to be a good guy. I’m not sure where to start, but I appreciate you for reading and hope you have a great day.

(Recently i came to know about his personal life problem that his father used to be abusive since childhood and drunker, fiend. and he went to classmates house and complained about Veerya. His father said he is mentally ill boy and thrown him out of his own house ) so his father clearly wanted to damege his image because of the fight. Veerya seperated his father to protect his mother. And his father went totally nuts with destroying his image. His father is so weild and bad person.

While in college My friend never mentioned about his personal life problems. He came to know about his father's doing these things behind his back.

After completing of college life he completely distanced himself from all the friends , including female friends. Also left Whatsapp group, all social media accounts. Etc. 
He didn't pick anyone's call. And completely ignored. I think he felt so embarrassed because of his Father's behaviour. And isolated from outside social Circle.

So in our all the old friends meetup, hangout trips. He is the only guy ubsent. I can't even go to visit his home personally. Because I knew he will not like it.

It's been 7 years. No contact. I still miss him and cherish those old memories in which he made me feel so special. And happy.

So yesterday our mutual female friend contacted him in messaging, he was rude to her(but he used to be very nice and decent boy) he sent her vulgur memes, extreme sexual  content. Which led her to block him.

_foxwhite,[Advice needed] My options helping someone with severe anxiety/stress,1,1c6cyas,1,"Hi,

To start off, we live in UK and we have already tried something called ""Talking Therapies"" to no avail the person was deemed not having ""severe enough"" symptoms which to me is a joke and their system is broken anyway it seems. 

So I am desparate to get some advice on how to help somebody that is suffering from a severe anxiety/stress as well as severe OCD that is affecting our life very much on a daily basis and I always feel like there's nothing I can do to help and the helplessness is killing me too at the same time.

Independent_Mud_3330,Bittersweet dreams caused by what I didn’t get while growing up,1,1c6cy06,0,"Hope this is not creepy or anything

I am an 18y old female and my father was simply put pretty much a monster (feels wrong to describe his personality and actions here) and I have lived with my mom since I was 8 or 9. I always wish I had a good, kind father or father figure in my life, there is a big hole in my heart and it feels so empty.

Whenever I see someone in a show or movie or series, either someone real or a character (always grown men), that I pay extra attention to and get a weird equivalent of what people would call a crush (idk), I never have romantic or sexual thoughts about them. I just get happy seeing them happy and stuff, and they seem so kind and like really wholesome people so in the back of my head I kind of wish they were a father figure in my life.

I keep on dreaming about them in non-sexual and non-romantic ways. I simply spend some quality wholesome ”father-daughter time” with them. In those dreams I am either my age or younger, and they may give me piggy back rides, we may joke together, go on trips and adventures together or just eat something together. The kind of kisses I would want from them are forehead kisses, and just friendly hugs.

This is not any form of fetish or anything, this is just purely a wholesome dream world in my mind, where they genuinely saw me as family and it is painful waking up from those dreams, not because I am missing out on them but because I get to be purely happy in those dreams and experience the things I have been missing out on, those dreams make me feel whole again and when I wake up it feels extra lonely and empty. 

I don’t know how to cope with this because I still want to have those kinds of dreams (hope they are not creepy but my mind basically just replaces the made up characters with people I like and look up to). I have very vivid dreams so I can basically cherish them as fictional memories. I kind of mourn them when I am awake. I know I will never have a father figure in my life because my mom isn’t interested in having any partners anymore and no man in my entire living family tree is even close to a good person.

I have absolutely no idea how to cope with the emptiness, and that is my biggest struggle. Everytime I see happy healthy families in reality or fiction I feel sad, a bit jealous and empty, and I mourn the things I didn’t have. I don’t want to just move on with life and accept that I don’t have any father figure and can be strong without it. I just want to go back in time but in an alternative reality, where I can have a happy family. This hole feels like it will bever fill and I will permanently be affected by it.

Substantial-Spend-67,"Something good happened, and I might hate it?",1,1c6cxge,1,"Hi. I guess I'm coming here because I genuinely have no idea what to do. I have a best friend I could talk to, yes, but I struggle with feeling like a burden and would rather not turn to anyone specific about things, but I need to get this off my chest, even if it gets ignored.

(Note: oh, man, I just finished writing this and I didn't think it would end up being so long. Nor did I think I'd end up asking for advice at the end. I guess that's what happens when you finally open the floodgates, ahaha.)

I've never had an easy life when it comes to mental health in particular. I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 8 and it just got worse from there with more diagnosis being added. There's a lot that's happened and lot that's going south right now (I wish I could say what but they're different serious things and I don't even know if I can add multiple tags/flairs to a post - I'm quite new to this, ahaha) and I've been keeping it bottled in because I don't want to bother anyone. As a result, things upstairs have been getting bad again. To the point where I ended up resorting to harming myself yesterday for the first time in 5 years. I feel so guilty and pathetic about it, but I still feel like doing it again today. I don't want to, though, so I'm hoping this helps somehow. I think another thing that's weighing on me right now is my relationship?

For context, I'm 24(f) and this is the first person I've ever let in like this. I haven't had my first kiss yet, haven't held hands with a boy, gone on a date, nothing. I have a LOT of childhood trauma surrounding men, so even though I'm constantly being hit on and the opportunity to go out with someone or even just kiss them has always been there, I've just always had a very specific idea of how I wanted to feel when I was with someone and nobody's ever given me that (this is something I could always pick up on from just that early talking phase, as well as seeing how they interact with other people etc.) and so I've never been willing to settle.

When I was about 16, I started becoming very desperate to find someone who treated me how I wanted to be treated and made me feel how I wanted to feel. I was really into manifestation and all that at this time and had manifested little things for myself here and there, but then I decided to go big and try to manifest a partner. I had no real person in my mind, by the way. I just wrote down EVERYTHING I was looking for. From his height, to how they react in certain situations, to the relationship they have with their family, and everything in between. A year went by, two years, three, and still nothing. So, I eventually forgot about that list and went on with life. Fast forward to 2023 and I joined a music group chat for a genre I really liked but didn't know anyone else who did. I figured it'd be a way for me to make acquaintances or even friends with this similar interest. I introduced myself in the group and a few hours later, someone sent me a private message basically being like ""Hey, I noticed that we're the same age. Would you be opposed to being friends online?"" I said no and introduced myself. He told me his name and recommended a show I should watch (the conversation in the group was about shows everyone was watching and I'd mentioned that I was looking for something new because I'd just finished one). This was in August, by the way. We'd mainly just communicate in the group from there, but would private message each other recommendations and stuff very sporadically. It wasn't until September where our conversations started to become actual conversations that were not only fun and flowed seemlessly but got quite deep, too. Come November, I had caught some serious feelings. He's as close to perfect as perfect can get, I think. So much so that a few weeks ago, I remembered that list and realised that he ticks every single box on it. From his height (to the last decimal), all the way to how he speaks to me, how he treats others, the music he listens to, and everything in between. The only problem is me.

He knows I struggle with mental health and is not only very accepting of me anyway, but he's also incredibly understanding, supportive, and most importantly, patient and open with me. However, over the last week or two of this episode getting worse, I'm finding myself wanting to do things to push him away. I'm finding myself being upset about things I shouldn't be upset about, but I obviously won't tell him this because he hasn't done anything wrong and I'm probably just being crazy and unstable right now. He's so genuinely good, I'll never understand why he's with me. He deserves so much better than someone who isn't at all attractive and has so much baggage. He deserves peace, in everything. Yet, he's here and he's not showing any signs of wanting to leave, but I'm still tempted to push him away even though I know it'll hurt me too. 

I don't know why this is happening honestly, but it's upsetting me because one part of me wants to ""set him free"" so to speak, but another part of me really doesn't want to mess this up at all because he makes me so happy. Am I selfish for not letting him go just because I'm happy with him, even though I know that dealing with me when I get like this isn't the easiest? Am I maybe just scared of something good happening to me because I've never believed that I deserve anything good at all?

I don’t know how this could trigger my feelings or if it was the reason, but I watched today a historical romance series. I know, series and movies aren’t reality. But somehow, after I closed my laptop and kind of came back to reality, I started feeling so empty and almost nostalgic? I don’t know how to describe it. 

And I suddenly had this increased feeling of insecurity. I’ve always been very insecure about my height, since I was bullied in first grade. I‘m only 4‘9ft / 1,45m tall and I really hate it. The fact, that I can’t actually change anything about it just makes it even worse. I want to just be average height or at least a bit taller. It’s such a struggle to be this short. Think shopping for clothes. I just don’t feel pretty being so short. I feel like everyone just sees me as a little dwarf and it frustrates me incredibly. 

I‘ve also never had a boyfriend before and I feel like it could actually be because of my height. I don’t think I‘m ugly, but my height makes me very insecure. I’ve tried to accept it and there’s days where I‘m less insecure about it. But I wished so bad that I was at least a tiny bit taller.

SnooEpiphanies7581,Why do I constantly convince myself that I look like a pedophile?,10,1c5z7ek,7,"Ok so I guess I should start with some background to get the full picture so-
 I'm 23M and have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and have had self-harm and addiction issues. It's also heavily speculated that I'm autistic by other autistics and such but I've not been officially tested. I currently work as an ABA therapist for children usually around 5-10 years old but I'm currently only working with one client because I'm newer.

I feel extremely uncomfortable trying to explain this to anyone because I'm afraid it'll be taken the wrong way and further prove my case. But, I've had these consistent paranoid thoughts while I work with my client. It happens more often while I'm changing him when I try to assist him in becoming independent in the bathroom and if I make any sort of physical contact with them.
I worry that I'm a pedophile without being fully aware of it or that I look like a pedophile to others. As soon as anything happens that triggers it I feel extreme guilt and questions echo through my head. ""Am I touching him in a way that looks weird? Is this somehow sexual? Why are you looking at him at all when he's on the toilet? Are you staring too long?"" And nothing is happening. He once sat on my leg and I was praying his mom wouldn't come in and I assume she's going to yell at me and kick me out of her home. 

I feel with my borderline it's even harder because I generally have no trust in myself because of how impulsive I am. I feel like I can never say that I wouldn't do something that's reckless or dangerous. I'm just one slip-up away from being a terrible person just from the lack of care of anything besides the adrenaline. So, if I think I'm somehow a pedophile then I'm definitely a creep and I'm actually the worst person to exist.
I have been groomed and taken advantage of when I was underage so maybe it's trauma? I genuinely don't know what's going on and it's very upsetting especially when I have to work with this every day.

I've tried, I've tried a lot, and it keeps blowing up in my face and leaving me worse off. I know logically I can't just give up, and a lot of why things have ender poorly in the past is circumstance, luck, or genuinely crazy people, but it doesn't make it any easier to deal with. So I've really given up on people and trying to make connections, because I feel it's better than recurrent disappointment. 

I know I can't expect anything to change if I don't put myself out there to risk said disappointment (or maybe take the chance things going well finally), but I also have no desire at all to attempt it.

pt92_01,I'm (31M) obsessed with best friend (28M) from 15 years ago and it's so depressing - should I end it or try to make the best of it?,1,1c6cgxd,0,"Let me take you back to 2009. I was 16 and had no real friends through my teenage years. Through church I became friends with a guy three years younger than me. Let's call him Mike. Over that year we spent a lot of our time together and became best friends. I had been very depressed and lonely before this and was just so happy to have a real friend.

  
After about a year, Mike began to want to spend more time with other friends too. Which of course makes total sense ... but me being a lonely and immature 17 year old took this as rejection. And I started to become obsessed. Any spare time I had I was wondering what he was doing right at that moment. Who h e would be hanging out with and having fun without me? I guess I just had really intense FOMO. We were still very close friends, but when I wasn't around him I was always pining for him.

  
After another 4 years or so (2015), my mental health problems and general negative attitude led to Mike ghosting me completely. This was a horrible time for me. It took about a year before I really functioned again properly. And I was back to having zero friends, and being very depressed and lonely. But gradually I stopped thinking about him so much.

  
Then three years later (2018) he reached out to me, and we began to again hang out on a very sporadic basis (like 3 or 4 times a year). While this was awesome, it also revived all those feelings of pining for him, and just feeling not satisfied with the amount of time we spent together and wanting a closer relationship again.  
We've continued on this basis ever since. I now see him once or twice a year at most. And then we only meet for about an hour for a coffee or something. And it's just so hard, because after all these years he's still my only friend, and I feel like I just want a much closer relationship, and it makes me so sad that it isn't like that and there's seemingly nothing I can do about it. Mike is now married but I know he still has other friends he sees more than me. So I'm always feeling a bit put out, and wondering if he really even likes me anymore or just meets me because he sort of pities me.

  
So my question is ... what on earth should I do here? After all these years, the feelings of longing for a closer friendship are clearly not going to go away. Would it be better to cease contact altogether and try to forget about him? I'm not even sure if it's possible but the feelings of pining are so intense I don't know how to live with it.

  
---

  
Some further info. I'm asexual so I've always been single and am always likely to be, which obviously doesn't help with loneliness. I've never been able to make other friends - for some reason I just don't click with people. I suspect I may be on the spectrum but really bot sure. It may sound like I'm in love with Mike. And like, maybe I am? I don't know what love feels like? My pining is very specifically for him and not just for friendship in general.",1713366970.0,

We've been together since we were 17 (24 years and married 16).  Like all couples We've had our fair share of ups and downs.  I started my healing journey over 2 years ago at 38 and have made huge strides in my mental health and relationship...none of which acknowledged by my better (or lesser?) Half.  I never thought I suffered from trauma bc I always thought trauma was physical or sexual.  Mine was emotional.  Or lack there of.  My father was a good man...the greatest father who ever lived.  But he was an alcoholic.  As i started becoming a man he slowly started not being there.  I don't know what's worse...the dad who goes to get milk and never comes back or the dad who one day you wake up and he's gone? 

From my healing journey I've learned ALOT of things.  Boundaries, how to fix the hole in my love cup, my validation issues, as well as that trauma is carried in us for 3 generations.  My grandma cheated, my dad cheated, and sadly I cheated.  I hate myself everyday for what I did.  But just like an an Olympic athlete who broke their leg and failed.  I didn't give up. I worked on myself.  I've been going twice a month for the past almost 3 years to personal counseling and have worked on so many things to become a better husband, father, and man.  

What I struggle with now is that I suffer from severe anxiety.  Which as most know turns into depression.  But from my counseling and personal work I have beat my depression.  The problem is I still suffer from anxiety from time to time.  But I deal with it pretty well.  I run a very successful landscape company and from ""March madness"" to ""April radness"" I am balls to the wall.  Every spring my wife and I usually go to hell and back again.  My stress is at an all time high but I do pretty damn well at dealing with it day in and day out.  

But my drug of choice/love language is music.  And I don't think it's too much to ask to go to a concert at minimum once a month...if not twice.  All I do is work and come home.  I have built literally a fucking paradise (I've attached pictures to show). My life this March and April has been nothing but work and cheer comps and family functions.  It's been almost 2 months since my last concert and I asked my wife (after a 2 day cheer comp and watching her brothers fucking whining ass twins the weekend before) to go to one of my top 3 fave artists Paul Cauthen  next weekend and the response I got hurt me.  She told me ""he's not my vibe"".  I'm taking her and my 10 year old obsessed daughter to Poland to see Taylor Swift (who's not my vibe yet I'm learning every word to every song).  I do ALOT of shit that's ""not my vibe"" but if my wife asked me to go see Morgan Wallen who I cant stand I'd suck it up and go. So that hurt

We just got done with a 2 day cheer comp that I pushed through and the day we were leaving I fell asleep on the drive home bc I was physically and mentally exhausted.  She stopped at Buccees to get gas and left me in the car in 80 degree heat with the windows rolled up.  I woke up 30 minutes later ""suffocating"" (not really but hot AF with stale air).  I opened the door to get fresh air and her God dman alarm starts going off nonstop.  Mind you I'm coming out of a deep slumber and people are looking at me like I'm trying to steal her fucking volkswagen atlas.  I don't know about you but ANYONE I know that gets woken up abruptly from a nap is not going to be kosher.  I call her and tell her she needs to get out here ""to turn her fucking car alarm off"".  

Apparently we can cuss like sailors all day long but the minute I say ""fucking"" it's enough to piss her off that she tells me I'm a ""shitty person"".  So of course that irritates me even more that I remain silent all the way home and because of that I'm even ""shittier"" bc I let the gas station incident bother me when I know damn well she would never leave her fucking dog in the car with the windows rolled up for 30 minutes.   I'm not even on the same level of respect as this fucking fluffy ass labradoodle bitch ass dog.   

And now bc I've brought up my feelings I've been made to feel like shit once again where I (like most husbands) wish I would of never said shit and just stuffed it deep down inside until I finally commit schmuicide leaving everyone (mostly her) wondering ""omg I have no idea why he did it"".

I'm building so much fuckig hate and resentment towards her that I just want to say fuck it and get drunk as shit and fuck any and everything in front of me.  Like why am I putting any effort forward into any of it?  I'm lost....

polarizedrose,scared of being alone and always bored- how can i (19F) fix it and find myself?,1,1c6bbm2,0,"I grew up lonely, without friends or anyone who I was really close to, and my family was not helpful, so I spent all my time bored and distracted myself with media or obsessing over crushes and other people because it distracted me from my own loneliness and boredom. 

My entire life, the media has taught me that when I find the “one” all my problems would go away and that I would always have them and I would never feel lonely or bored ever again. I also blamed my constant loneliness and boredom on not having any friends (other than online friends) and I thought everything would go away once I solved those two issues.

I did it. I found the one. They are everything I’ve ever wanted and more. I have a group of amazing wonderful friends who care about me and love spending time with me, and vice versa. 

But my OCD, anxiety and fear of loneliness is ruining it for me. Every time i’m with my partner, instead of enjoying my time being loved and cared for and giving the same energy back, I get insecure and scared that they will leave me and stop loving me and I become extremely anxious and have OCD attacks and it’s ruining our relationship.

My partner and a very close friend of ours talked to me and we agreed that the best course of action would be for us to take a break so that I could find myself and learn how to be ok with being alone.

That’s the problem. I don’t know how. None of the media I used to distract myself with is working and I don’t have the mental energy to consume new media. I have no hobbies, and I don’t have money to really engage or learn anything new. I can’t drive, and my parents are very controlling and so I don’t get a lot of freedom and independence at home. 

I’ve been in therapy, and it doesn’t work. Maybe I just haven’t found the right therapist but I can’t find someone who understands me. I am neurodivergent (autistic and possibly have ADHD) and diagnosed with severe OCD, anxiety and depression. I don’t know what to do with myself or where to start.

All day every day I want to do nothing but surround myself with others or sleep the day away so that I don’t have to face the reality and boredom of being alone.

How can I fix this? I want to be better and change, for myself, my friends, and my partner.

ChargeFox,Things starts to get weirder,1,1c6alcy,0,"As the title says, everything seems to go downhill for me. And I'll give how all this has started.

It all started when I reached 13 years old and im going to give you a note, It's not the best year of school me unfortunately and it lasted 1 or probably 2 years but since covid hit at year 2, i wouldn't really count it.

So first off, everyday before i got to school, i had to wake up at 4:00 A.M and follow my mother to her school (since she is also a teacher) and also since school buses wouldn't want to take me from home  due to the fact that our road is too small. But the thing that icks me the most is not waking up, but rather waiting for a whole 7 hours, inside a car without any cooling.

Everything felt pretty good and usual at first, but after 3-4 months of doing it everyday, it's starting to get to me. The heat from just inside the car even when i opened the car doors and windows is just extremely hot. Everytime i got to school im already drenched in sweat, itchy, annoyed, stressed and tired. Plus, my friends always tried to ask me to do things and if not, they will try to annoy me by saying im weak. That's not all, because im mentally in a bad mood on that year, everything seems to make me extremely angry.

My bad mood during that year actually made me do some risky choices, like i accidently got mad at my friend and i always think that all people around me are just trying to disturb me and the Worst part is, i can't controll it. This behaviour of thinking made me some potential enemies and even my bullies starts to disturb me more.

Fast fowards today, I still feel that im there's something stuck inside me during that situation. I don't know if it's trauma or anything but how did i get it? It's supposed to not be as bad as it is. Today, me and my friend aren't that close as we used to be anymore. There's just something off about him. He seems to be sometimes pushy and gets angry quite easily.

I think maybe im overreacting, but my mental health isn't improving either. Start seeing things and the voices in my head tries to bring me down everytime im not in the mood, and it won't shut up. 

What the heck am i experiencing right now?

I've been (22 male ) wrestling with some mental health issues lately, and I could really use some insight and support from this community. Here's a bit about what I'm going through:

Delusion of Becoming Great: I often find myself caught up in grandiose fantasies of achieving greatness, which sometimes feel out of touch with reality.

Mood Swings: My emotions seem to fluctuate wildly – one moment I'm filled with joy and optimism, and the next, I'm overwhelmed with sadness and uncertainty.


Overthinking: I tend to overanalyze every situation, replaying conversations and scenarios in my head until they consume my thoughts, leading to increased anxiety and stress.

Constant Future-Thinking: My mind is constantly racing, obsessing over what the future holds and how I can secure success and validation.

Hyper-Competitive Nature: I have this intense drive to outperform others, which can be exhausting and often leads to unnecessary stress and tension in my relationships.

Dishonesty and Manipulation: I've noticed a pattern of lying and manipulating situations to make myself look better or to avoid confronting uncomfortable truths.Persistent Self-Image: Despite setbacks and failures, I have this persistent belief that I am destined for greatness, which can be both motivating and isolating.

Depression About the Future: While I envision greatness, there's also a looming sense of dread and hopelessness about what lies ahead, which often leaves me feeling paralyzed and overwhelmed.

Insomnia: Sleep has become elusive, as my mind refuses to quiet down, leaving me tossing and turning through the night.I know this is a lot to unpack, but any advice, coping strategies, or shared experiences would be immensely appreciated. Thanks for lending an ear and offering your support.",1713348320.0,
nuvolettt,Am I experiencing paranoia or is it just regular overthinking?,1,1c6aa1s,0,"Throwaway because I’m a bit embarrassed.
(Almost) every time I experience even the smallest inconvenience, I get extremely stressed and start worrying that things will go worse. I get paranoid and start imagining scenarios where bad things happen or have happened.
I don’t understand if it’s normal or not.

I’ll give you a couple examples:
- my period is currently a week late. I haven’t had sex in years so I can’t be pregnant. but I’m getting paranoid that maybe I am. how? somehow my brain is convinced that maybe I got SA’d and I don’t remember it. I’ve NEVER been SA’d so I don’t know where this is coming from. I’m thinking about buying a pregnancy test just to make sure because I’ve been so anxious for the past week and I keep worrying about it. It’s not the first time this happens. I had the same thoughts last year and then eventually my period came and I forgot about it.
- a bit of context but I’ll try to keep it short: when I was 18 I briefly dated a guy. He broke up with me because his ex made up some (fake) rumors about me kissing someone else at a party, just so they could get back together. I later started dating my now ex-bf and I was very scared it would happen again. I would think about this scenario every day, so I started taking “precautions”. Since his ex lived in the same city as me, I was scared that if she saw me she could make up some lies about what I was doing. So I stopped hanging out alone in the city unless it was absolutely necessary. If I had to, I’d use hidden and less crowded streets and I’d religiously wear my mask (it was during COVID) so nobody could recognize me. I would also document where I was at any moment by taking a random pic (so the time stamp would show exactly where I was and when). I would do it like every couple of hours or so. Mind you, my ex never asked for this. It was all my doing. It went on for a year.

Usually when the issue that’s stressing me out gets resolved, these thoughts go away on their own. But if a new problem arises, I get new ones.
I went to therapy for a year but it didn’t help. My therapist would often forget things I told her during previous therapy sessions, so maybe she just wasn’t a good therapist, I don’t know. 
I do not have hallucinations and I am aware that these thoughts are crazy and that I shouldn’t listen to them, but still I can’t get them out of my head.
I just want to know if anyone else has experienced something similar and if I should seek help.

Can't find any other place to post it — I hope it fits the sub.  
So, I've recently had my first psychiatric appointment -- yay! It was initially due to my suicidal plans, but a bunch of other issues were brought up -- including struggling to adapt in groups and form relationships. While discussing my life, doc asked about my hobbies.

—Well, I draw...  
—Oh really? And what do you draw?  
—Now it's \[...\], but for a while it's been mostly, uhh... dark pics.

What I didn't mention is that by ""dark"" I meant violent yaoi guro pics with a necrophilic main character who just \*happened\* to be my old self-insert. That surely is embarassing to share, but it may also be an important piece of a puzzle.

SeawardFriend,"What should I do to get an official evaluation for ADD/ADHD, Autism, and EFD?",1,1c68seb,1,"I have been attending counseling for over a year now, and during that process, it was discovered that I have depression and most likely ADD/ADHD without hyperactivity. However, I have only been officially diagnosed with depression and have been on medication, but it doesn't seem to have made a significant difference.

Recently, I had a major argument with my parents, and they want me to get tested for ADHD. I believe I have it, as I exhibit multiple symptoms. But I also think there is more to it. I suspect that I may be autistic, as I struggle with social skills, experience unmanageable anxiety, and have certain over-sensitivities to tastes and smells. Additionally, I am confident that I have Executive Function Disorder (EFD), which seems to be the root of most of my issues. I find it challenging to understand how or why certain things need to be done, and I don't take pleasure in things that others find enjoyable.

I have taken some online tests, which I understand are not conclusive, but they suggest that I might be somewhere on the spectrum, and I can relate to the EFD prompts as if they were made for me. Although I have ADHD symptoms, I think they would be almost unnoticeable if I could find a way to manage these other issues. The same goes for my depression, which stems from my reluctance to change or improve anything about my life as well as my incompetence towards social situations.

Should I talk to my counselor about this? Maybe my Doctor would give better recommendations? Any advice would be appreciated!",1713357625.0,

Then recently she just to act differently again, I first shrugged it off cause I knew ever since the incident we all changed and thought she was just adjusting. But today I just saw all the signs again.
She was going hyper doing as many things as possible, then had this new relevation on a new activity it turns out she always loved, keeps making backhanded comments at my dad, sent me a message on a nostalgic memory and how she always loves me and forced my dad to throw his bed sheets out the dryer because it finished early but she just played with the settings cause she didn’t like the sound.

I was 14 he was 20. We used to chat alot and I was very insecure about how I looked and he used to give me so much attention he called me bestfriend and I saw no harm in that. I was just happy that someone wanted to spend time with me and talk to me ig. 
So I had already known him for a year and half but I don’t remember I was 15 or 14 when this first thing happened. We were in my room, and talking and we were sitting close. We were hugging and all of a sudden he asked - “you have never kissed before na?” I said no or I just moved my head saying no (I don’t remember correctly). Then he started kissing me. Idk how it felt but not romantic, I didn’t stop or didn’t say no for the kiss. Then he started touching me inappropriately, in my pants and THERE. I moved his hands away and said NO this time. But we were still kissing. He kept coming to touch me and I kept moving his hands away. He eventually stopped with his hand but we were still kissing. 
This happened. 

After that, we didn’t talk about the touch. But he said the kiss was good, and I just agreed. 

Now, I don’t usually go out with him, so we used to chat alot. Idk how this happened where it started but he made me watch porn or maybe he just suggested. He said it was healthy or stuff, I watched and I didn’t know it was wrong, I thought it to be something common. 
Then things started going downhill, we had sex, idk if its manipulation or not. Idk if I wanted it or not at that moment. I know that I didn’t like it. He used to cover my face when doing it, so I don’t scream. That was the most embarrassing and terrible thing for me, him covering my face idk. This I remember not liking. This happened 4-5 times ig. I remember one time I was really sad, and he had known that my parents were out. I thought that he knows Im sad so we wouldn’t be having sex this time. But I was wrong. 

The first time we had it, I asked randomly what were we now? But he said whatever I want we can be. He said that he didn’t have problem in having me as a gf, but that time I thought what was this thing. This isn’t a way of saying these things, so I said no, even tho I wanted us to be in relationship. We said we loved each other everyday but we weren’t in a relationship because we didn’t define it. 

Moreover, the sex I am way sure if something like this happened now (Im 18 now) I would say no to. I know I was not liking it. But, I don’t remember saying NO, so is it my fault. Or should he have asked first? because he never asked. Sometimes he didn’t use condoms.

Last week i tried to *croak* so I posted something on my instagram, left my phone and walked out the house. I was thinking about attempting to take my life via drowning, but I was too chicken shit to do it, I’ll admit that. I went back home, got stopped by police and I didn’t get to work that day. Then I’ve just been very irritated, getting into arguments with everyone in my life, I had some meltdown last night. 

That’s not a good thing is it? My meltdowns have been getting worse these last few weeks, and you know what, that’s okay. Because if I do get the courage to *croak* at least I’m accepting of it. 

Have you guys thought of killing yourselves?

I’ve been having this urge that I need to leave the state. I have the money to go fly out and never come back, so why not? I wanna fly away. 

Never come back.

Because home doesn’t make sense, that’s the thing.

You don’t get to leave home if you’re not happy.

That’s what that is. 

Home is t happy.

Happy isn’t home, but walking away from that is.

Goldac77,Tip/advice on how to communicate to people about my condition ,1,1c67o2c,4,"So I have psychosis (it's been about 4 years since my diagnosis), and every once in a while I have an episode that last a couple of days or even weeks. Within that period I can be somewhat dangerous, so I find it easier to isolate myself (and sometimes hurt myself to avoid hurting others).

I don't have many friends, but the few I have who sometimes get entangled when my episode happens ask questions, because they don't understand. I try my best to explain, but no matter what I say, they don't seem to understand, or rather want to understand?? And insist on giving me ""professional"" advice on how to manage it, when they clearly don't know what they're talking about

These episodes, naturally, also impact my productivity when it comes to work or school. I'm seeking for some tips on how to better communicate to my employers and colleagues that this is my situation, and I can't help it. And that when it happens I'm best left alone.

knockdownthewall,"Does anyone else who's recovered sometimes miss the ""drama"" of mental illness?",7,1c5w0ae,4,"I've been steadily improving for the past few years now. I definitely am glad for it, of course - everything in my life is so much better and easier now I don't feel like there's a ticking time bomb in my head ready to sabotage me. Sometimes though - perhaps it's my self destructive side - I miss the intensity of being mentally ill.
When I was at my most mentally unwell, I was constantly oscillating between extreme euphoria and suicidality. Everything came in extremes and was incredibly overwhelming, but was also incredibly vibrant and... inspiring maybe? Sometimes when I'm doing something that makes me happy, I think ""this would feel better if I was still like that"". Of course it's not the same for the bad parts - every day I'm grateful I don't get the bad parts anymore - but even then there's that bit of a kind of poisonous draw of feeling something that intensely, even if it's negative. Everything was incredibly melodramatic, and had its own kind of beauty and romanticism because of that. I could just unpredictably burst into a drug-like euphoria for no reason, and that kind of state of mind makes it possible to appreciate things in a way which isn't possible otherwise.

To reiterate, I am definitely glad to be better and I don't feel like I'm lacking in anything significant. Stability - genuine stability - is something worth waiting and working for. It's more of a thought I entertain sometimes. I've talked to my brother about it who has similar mental issues to me and he's felt the same thing so I'm just curious if anyone else has.

cloudsurfinggg,TW: child abuse or idk what to name it?,1,1c67j97,0,"Idk if Im traumatised or stuff, I was abused as a child sexually by a man 6 years elder than me. I was 14 he was 20. We used to chat alot and I was very insecure about how I looked and he used to give me so much attention he called me bestfriend and I saw no harm in that. I was just happy that someone wanted to spend time with me and talk to me ig. 
So I had already known him for a year and half but I don’t remember I was 15 or 14 when this first thing happened. We were in my room, and talking and we were sitting close. We were hugging and all of a sudden he asked - “you have never kissed before na?” I said no or I just moved my head saying no (I don’t remember correctly). Then he started kissing me. Idk how it felt but not romantic, I didn’t stop or didn’t say no for the kiss. Then he started touching me inappropriately, in my pants and THERE. I moved his hands away and said NO this time. But we were still kissing. He kept coming to touch me and I kept moving his hands away. He eventually stopped with his hand but we were still kissing. 
This happened. 

After that, we didn’t talk about the touch. But he said the kiss was good, and I just agreed. 

Now, I don’t usually go out with him, so we used to chat alot. Idk how this happened where it started but he made me watch porn or maybe he just suggested. He said it was healthy or stuff, I watched and I didn’t know it was wrong, I thought it to be something common. 
Then things started going downhill, we had sex, idk if its manipulation or not. Idk if I wanted it or not at that moment. I know that I didn’t like it. He used to cover my face when doing it, so I don’t scream. That was the most embarrassing and terrible thing for me, him covering my face idk. This I remember not liking. This happened 4-5 times ig. I remember one time I was really sad, and he had known that my parents were out. I thought that he knows Im sad so we wouldn’t be having sex this time. But I was wrong. 

The first time we had it, I asked randomly what were we now? But he said whatever I want we can be. He said that he didn’t have problem in having me as a gf, but that time I thought what was this thing. This isn’t a way of saying these things, so I said no, even tho I wanted us to be in relationship. We said we loved each other everyday but we weren’t in a relationship because we didn’t define it. 

Moreover, the sex I am way sure if something like this happened now (Im 18 now) I would say no to. I know I was not liking it. But, I don’t remember saying NO, so is it my fault. Or should he have asked first? because he never asked. Sometimes he didn’t use condoms.

Correct_Elephant5703,She Went Crazy,2,1c63vxr,0,"TW: >!Possible sexual assault!<

I've been with my partner for 15 years. She's 38 I'm 36M no kids. Her moods have been spiraling since November and they've manifested as jealousy and controlling behavior. She gets into my stuff and always used what she finds as evidence or proof that I was cheating. These were the early warning signs that I was dismissive of and thought she was just *being a dick* to me. I should've done better.

We have a really solid foundation and this deterioration only started in 2022.

Anyway, we'd get into nasty fights over my alleged cheating and when I got tired of proving the ways it was impossible and how busy and tired I am all the time providing for her and how logistically unlikely even me going out to fuck was, the fights eventually devolved into ad hominem attacks both ways. I took it personally as I would never cheat, but I do enjoy being given the space and flexibility to live my life and have my friends as anyone else would.

It truly got toxic and I regret every second of it. I lashed out back at her in ways I shouldn't ever have. I told her she was ungrateful. I told her I deserved better in terms of trust and faith given what I do. I called her a dildo (when I resort to name-calling I make sure to swap the name to a *really stupid name* so that we can laugh), etc..

# Background

To give a few examples:

* A towel in my kitchen she hadn't recognized. I couldn't account for it. Towels come and go. She looked up unboxing videos of all my kitchenware to find where it could've come from. Nobody could account for that towel. I'm not going to commit to memory every little knickknack I bring from work or buy somewhere or order online.
* Another example, she built up one of my female friends as an antagonist and started blowing up her spot asking if there was anything between us. I've been nothing but transparent about my relationship with her, but she latches onto every little interaction as ""proof"" of something going on. Example: she knows my friend likes blue and once I bought my partner a blue outfit and thought I was trying to ""turn \[her\] into \[my friend\].""
* Last example, I've recently haven't felt comfortable having her on my social media. She reads into every interaction and finds a reason for conflict and pain there. But now she tracks the fluctuations in my follower/following count. She correlates them to events/accusations and thinks that I'm either adding people I shouldn't be (exes, flings, APs), or unadding people to cover my tracks when my counts go down. Truth is, these counts fluctuate for any reason, people could remove me, or deactivate/reactivate their accounts. I cannot give straight answers for this.

*And my dumbass thought she was just being a dick.*

I'm not writing this to blast on my partner.  I truly love her. Her presence is so large in my heart I cannot overstate it and she completes my life. The suffocating jealousy stuff leads to nasty fights where I snap back, but when the relationship works, it works extremely well. The reason I wrote those examples was that I should've seen what was coming next.

# Symptoms/Timeline

**Day One**

She was fine. Coherent. Lucid. Talking and functioning with me. She was making dinner and she called me over to the kitchen in a panic. She made me take a drink of water from a glass. She said it so panicked that I relented and then she yelled,""Spit it out!"". I'm like why? She said, ""I thought you would die."" I was dumbfounded. I thought she was fucking with me or making a point about gaslighting given our last jealousy fight.

She gradually snapped. I did not realize it but she was going completely bonkers. She started saying things that made less and less sense over time. ""My brain is trying to kill itself."" She was still so sharp and bright that *she knew what was happening long before I did*. I thought she was being dramatic or messing with me further. I was in denial.

Hours later she lost her grip in reality and started asking me impossible questions. She asked me if I was her mother reincarnated. She asked me if I was her cat. She thought her family died and then she broke out into pure panic/ugly-crying. I called them to disprove that and she calmed down a little bit. I started taking it serious by this point, obviously.

She started showing more and more erratic behaviors. She wasn't sleeping. Woke me up every few hours to ask me questions about ghouls and demons and her childhood . She told me childhood sexual traumatic events that she later admits couldn't possibly be real (molested by people who should've been dead at the time). She had a really weird and creepy/unhealthy fascination with sexuality. She started telling me about the ghosts that live in my house and how they talk to her. Her gaze fixated on random spots in the wall. I would ask ""What's there?"" she'd answer: ""you know what's there."" It was frustrating and unnerving as you can imagine.

Terrifying behavior, and it got worse.

**Day Two**

Next day I couldn't keep her focused. The extent of her focus was essentially half a sentence and she couldn't maintain conversational continuity. I couldn't ask follow-up questions about something she said 15 seconds ago. It was extremely painful and it's as if she became a shell of her former self. I thought I lost her and I was distraught.

Then the screaming started. She would cry and scream in sheer terror. I lost it. I'm not a crier, but this week I've cried more than I've cried in my entire life. Seeing her in that unbelievable, undefinable pain tore me to pieces. I thought I lost my girl forever and I literally begged her to come back to me. She'd cry with me but she lost the capacity to understand anything.

I took her to the E.R.. They basically made sure she wasn't a danger to me or herself and did the basic bloodwork and vitals and sent her on her way. She can present *mostly* normal under social pressure by this point, but I was disappointed with the result. I understand what E.R's are tailored to do but I feel like psychiatric assessment should've been included considering how quickly her condition was deteriorating. They gave me a psychiatrist appointment... for *next week*.

**Day Three**

The next day was absolute terror. My life was a horror movie with screaming and crying and bouts of random rage (no violence, thankfully).  At times I could bring her out and talk to her, but she could not focus on me. I tried to get her to eat. She'd take 2-3 bites of food at most. I was very strict and made her sleep in the evening. She'd pop up behind me like a ghost every 45 minutes. I started treating her like a child (I had to). I limited what shows she could watch because some shows had content she couldn't handle and would send her into another cry-screaming frenzy. The milder, funny shows that we rewatch often bothered her too, she would think the show's plot never played out before the way it is playing out now. She thought I was gaslighting her.

The screaming was so bad I got a letter from the H.O.A.

**Day Four**

The day after that I took her to the E.R. again. She could present less normally this time around. They'd ask her the basic questions and she'd stare blankly for 40 seconds... ""I'm sorry what was the question?""

I'm sitting there like a dummy like ?????? are you not seeing this? They didn't get her a psychiatrist then either. They prescribed her a drug, but I couldn't fill the prescription that night.

**Final Day**

The final day, it got to the lowest point. She could no longer function. It was pure screaming. No conversation. Her body would go completely limp and then she'd have random ticks. Snapping, mouth clicking. She'd arrange dumb table things (wallet, keys, phone) in a very orderly way and then go limp or sway her head.

I tried to get her to understand that I needed to send her to go get help. She'd nod and agree. I tried to ask her to write it for me so I know some part of her is there. She wrote some creepy shit on the paper and nonsense hieroglyphs.

I had desperately navigated our country's (US) arcane medical system and finally got some county people to show up and take her away to an involuntary mental health clinic. They've started treatment and observation and *finally* got her some good help. I've been calling her every day and little by little she's coming back to me.

She can keep longer conversations and recall things that have been said minutes ago. The mood swings are still in effect. When I'm sweet to her she starts sobbing which leads to her saying delusional things but I can talk her down out of it. When we joke she's the most herself. She **adores** dark humor. I told her ""If you told me I'd be in a mental hospital someday in the near future, I'd think it was for me."" and she laughed and called me a crazy. She can barely recall hellweek.

She's normally sharp and resourceful. She's the one I come to for advice in navigating life stuff like the medical system. So when she left me like that, I was lost and in a panic. I tried to fish her out to ask her things like: ""If you were in my position, what would you do?"" Which is totally unfair and I shouldn't have pressured her to try and think so hard and I'm really sorry. She couldn't give me a straight answer.

**Present**

Every day I call her she's a little more *her.* It's looking good and I hope to have her back home soon. I never knew I could be in this much pain to see a loved one fall apart. In hindsight the jealous bullshit doesn't matter anymore. I know there's a reason for it. And I need to take ownership and get her help she needs to deal with those manic feelings of persecution. I **never** validated her jealousy feelings, I always confronted them head-on. I figured validating them was admitting that I had cheated or flirted with someone, but I could've also gently validated (without gaslighting) that there is a very good reason for them, and that is her deteriorating mental health and gotten her help. I regret not doing better.

# Why I'm Here

Anyway, I didn't see the early warning signs. She had a psychiatrist but she stopped seeing them 7 months ago. She quit her prescriptions around the same time. Little by little she started unraveling and I did not recognize it in time before I had to have her committed.

I want to know: What could I have done better to support her?

What could she be going through? Can you help me understand it? The doc says it's likely a mood disorder with psychotic features. That this is easily treatable and people who are willing to be helped come back from it. She is a smart girl, and she's very eager to get better.

What could that diagnosis mean? Something like BPD? I'm just looking for any insight at this moment. I've bugged her poor social worker with a million questions and I'm wanting to dig deeper and hear your insights. Obviously I'd take it with a grain of salt and wouldn't act on it.

Last point of concern, she keeps complaining about pains in her body. Often the back of her head or ribs. Could these be physiological? Could the E.R. have detected anything seriously wrong here (god-forbid a brain tumor)? Or could it be psychosomatic? The pain comes and then goes like it was never there.

Mountain_Draw_3147,I don’t know what to do,1,1c6732h,0,"This is about my mom’s life, not mine
It would be perfectly accurate to say my mom had a pretty ugly childhood. 

She had a sister, who always used to be the favourite. Her parents used to go slandering about her to her uncles and aunts. Her parents always used to consider her as a child of someone else. They mistreated her. Its like she would get awards from newspapers because she won a prize and all and her mom would hide it just because she believed it will make her fav child sad. That kind of awful shit. Many more like that happened too. I can’t explain it all here, but you get the idea. She was blamed for everything, her sis used to support her parents and single her out in the family. Toxic. Very. 

 It’s safe to say that her family was narcissistic. Nevertheless, she used to be great friends with her maternal cousins and her sister was part of the group too. 


Coming to now, her sister and the other relatives from her maternal side have grouped up against her. Also, her parents are dead. She was the one who looked after them. Her sis didn’t even do much because she used to say she had to work. 
So, the relatives and her sis celebrate everything luxuriously. She is the only person who is not invited to anything. Except for funerals and marriages. This fight started some time ago because of some meaningless thing. 

It's not better that my mom was married off to a person whose family was full of evil people too. Who did it? My grandfather itself. My dad used to say cruel things to her because she asked for money for educating my sis. He did not allow her to work. He obeyed whatever his family told him. His elder sister was adamant that my mom should not work. And she is highly qualified. They lied about my dad's profession to get him married. She wanted to divorce but couldn't because then all of her family would turn against her. They would say that she was the reason her sister could not get married (Note that in this place, arranged marriage is more prevalent). She had nowhere to go to. So she decided to put up with it. 
They are clearly terrible. She is an orphan. Her whole family has turned against her. Her family used to be her friends. So now she has no friends. She sits in the house all day, thinking about this. Sinking day by day into depression and I can't watch it anymore. Someone, pls help! She is in her late fourties now. She has no interest in anything anymore. She used to love the subject she was a master at. But as she has got out of touch for a looooong time, she isn't interested in the things she used to be. She isn't interest in her earlier profession too. 

She used to love doing housework, but her health is not that great too. Doing it makes her body pain a lot. So now, she has nothing to get engaged with and she is not interested in doing anything new. Also, pls don't advice therapy because someone told my mother that going for therapy is useless, all they do is give you more medications and they are not that great here. I don't think she'll up to online therapy too... She doesn't like it when i bring the subject of counselling i think. Idk. 
I think the thing about therapists might be true here. They care for money more ig.

I don't know how but after a lot of thinking I think I have a idea why.

I still love him I don't want to be without my partner so that is not the problem but my whole life I've had a bad body image .

Always checking the mirror daily , flexing and seeing my body only seeing bad things , afraid to gain weight , I step on the scale daily sometimes multiple times a day. 

Whenever we actually manage to have sex I always ask , was it good , did you enjoy  .

So I am a very unsure person I'm afraid to do things wrong , I have a massive amount of anxiety and I think all those things combined give me all these problems.

Backstory - about 14 months ago I was told by my wife she wanted space.. we had been together for 12 years married 10. We were a blended family with 4 children in total (2 hers and 2 ours.. ages f15, m13, m11, f9).. she has a disability support business and I am a self employed IT guy. I was the sole provider for my family for 90% of our time together. She was a stay at home mum. Then 2 years ago with my help she started this business she currently throws herself into. I was a retail manager for most of our time together until I hated not having weekends with my family so I made a change.

Our relationship was not the greatest but I was doing everything in my power to make it better.. constant therapy. Daily medication. I truly had in my mind .""if I fix myself ill fix my marriage,"" years of therapy.. time.. all gone

I found out a few months ago my wife (ex) is seeing a guy we knew. We knew him because he is the husband of one of her clients (lady dying of dementia).. yes I said that.. husband. He's older by some 20 years.. has money..
I have asked her why, and she says he gives her stability and security. Money more likely and on a side note im pretty positive she cheated on me with him.. but i will never know. 

I hate this. Not knowing stuff..

I love her, and feel I can't live without her or my kids/family. In my short 40 years she was/is/has been the best thing I ever had. I don't know happiness anymore... everything is dull. Kids visit... meh. I find a girl who is into me and wants to be in my life... meh. Why!? I just want to be happy again. Like I was.. or better..

You will all say live for your kids.. I say to this, my time with my children currently is temporary and then when their mother picks them up or I drop them home again.. I'm back to lonely. Quiet. Sad. Depressed. Sitting in my head trying to ""not think about"".. that's a joke it's impossible to not think about what or who you love or miss and care for.
The quiet times are filled with regret and sadness and good memories (sadly). I feel it would be easier to not have them for periods then to have them and get sad constantly.i know they will be looked after. And the money that my death would bring to them would get them ahead in this messed up world.

I have tried so much to stay here. Only thing I haven't done is run. Run away from these issues, escape and try to start over... somewhere else. Somewhere new. Away from her and the kids (I'm sorry kids I love you so much I just hurt all the time) I would only try this to regain some semblance of self worth.. me. I live near my family and see them often. She (ex) still has access to me and I'm trying to put more barriers in place so that contact is just kids. But honestly I get sad at it being only this, I just want to talk to her. For her to give a shit about me again. To know how her day was, everyday...

Fast forward to now. Today. This very second as I write this. I feel like ending it. Leaving this world. What's sad here is I currently have my kids with me...
I have.. Anxiety for days on end (hard to breathe), Panic attacks usually slip in and out. Sleep plagued with ""good memories"" that haunt me like nightmares.. waking me up, so I'm not sleeping great. Eating is a struggle but I do it when I can stomach something. I go for walks to clear my head.. basic exercise. 
I am high functioning depressive.. because I'm self employed if I don't work I can't afford my bills. So my work it's a temporary distraction from all of this but it's simply a mask that goes on as needed, and comes off just as quick.

I know in my heart it's done. It's over. She made choices. There isn't anything I can do. 
Above all this, the woman she was when we married, is who I love(d). Not the person she is now. Her work is her priority now... not even our kids.

I'm lost and confused and hurting in a world I dont want to be a part of.. I try to say to myself it's not that bad. Look at what's going on in the world... I would trade being scared in a war-torn country with my family, knowing I'm loved and I love them for this shit any day.

I'm sorry if I offend people. It's not my intention. I'm hurting.. and have been for a while now... I'm running out of energy... I have talked about this almost everyday with family friends psych etc. I just am running out of options and energy to fight off this darkness.

i cannot leave my current environment because i have no money and i can’t work becasue its really hard for me to even do normal things like breathe or drink water, getting out of bed to use the bathroom and all… i feel pathetic honestly….
i know the internet isn’t the best place what so ever to express oneself.. but i have no one face to face to talk to…. they won’t litsen to my side or even believe me. i know i can do nothing to change that….
my problem is… i look sad all the time and only ever really smile when it’s something i like is brought up or if im doing something i like or thinking about my favourite things.
i’m dissociating most if not all of the time…. but i feel like it’s an excuse and the folks i live with just tell me not to do it when it’s really out of my control…
and sometimes i like to get lost in my own imagination simply because environments are overstimulating and i just want to feel some sense of ease… this also feels like dissociation because i don’t feel like im in my body when i do that.. but i know that part isn’t dissociating.. i think.
if i explain any of this, they’ll never litsen to me… because they are set in their ways…
but when an ounce of this happened to them… i am there for them, or try to be… the best i could….
well… i’m not even sure if that’s true either.. i don’t know anymore….
i can’t feel it trust myself…
the thoughts won’t stop… i try to prevent these disasters… but it just happens anyway…

ArtisticPath2087,Is it standard practice to not talk or explain anything to the pacient?,1,1c65jib,0,"My experience 

Back in 2018 I had a psychotic break. I was paranoid, I was thinking that I am the most horrible person in the world and all the people I meet make fun of me and are sarcastic. So, I was quite paranoid as you can see, but no hallucinations and my thinking was still quite logical. This was the cherrry on top after a life long struggle with depression and anxiety, being bullied and literally not receiving any kind of help. My parents knew about my problems, but they cannot afford to have a ""sick"" child. They re poor. Also, my mother is a narcissist and lack empathy.
At that moment, I was financially independent, having my first job so when I accursed them of intruding into my privacy and reading my journal and making fun of me, they brought me to a psychiatrist ( because I would be the one to pay).

I was put on a medication, after akathisia, I was switched to another one. It worked like a charm. I was better in days. The problem is that, for me, my experience was real and after weeks in which no one made fun of me, I called my parents and said that I am going to kill myself if they don't tell me why they did this to me. They brought me to the doctor and the doctor just put me on a really high dose and add an extra med. 

The problem is...I didn't know what a psychosis was, I thought I am there for my life long depression. The doctor didn't mention once the word ""psychosis"" in front of me...When everyone makes fun of you and then all of a sudden no one makes fun of you, it s confusing, isn't it? But the doctor didn't try to reason with me or explain my diagnosis or anything. My diagnosis was severe depression with atypical features. I had no idea what a psychosis is, barely heard the word before so I couldn't put the pieces together and she didn't help me at all. I was a zombie for 3 years (yes, she mentain that high dose - 600mg quetiapine and I was a good girl and didn't complain bc I was afraid). 

She didn't explain once: 1. My diagnosis 2. My medication and how it works 3. How long should I take them 4. What is the long term prognosis.
 5. Not even mentioning the word psychosis 6. She led me to believe I was on antidepressants, when in fact I was on antipsychotics and something used for epilepsy ( Depakine Chrono)
I was too afraid to ask anything because she could just up my dose again like she did before...or put me in hospital. I was incapable of asserting my needs.

After 3 years, I started to wake up with dead numb arms and legs, like paralysed and then slowly I would try to move them little by little to start using them. I was really scared. I told her, she tried to make me believe I was just sleeping on my arm. After, I insisted she told me to take some expensive B vitamin formula. Since I was already taking multi vitamins as part of my daily routine, it was clear to me that she s not taking me seriously amd she didn't explain to me why vitamin B would help at all.

As a result, I took only half of the medicine for a couple of weeks and then I didn't take it all together. After, just a couple of days I wasn t numb anymore, but I was in full blown psychosis. It was hell like no one could imagine. I was still no hallucinations, but I couldn't function at all. Everyone was mercylessly making fun of me. It was like everybody hated me with all their soul. I thought that my diary was public and I am probably being spy on and made fun of 24/7. 

The most painful was that when I was in that hell my parents revealed to me that if I would have taken the meds carefully for another 2 years, I would have had the chance to a normal life, my doctor told them that I had the chance to be just fine. That was completely new to me, no one told me that!!! I was going there for 3 years, never complaining, always taking my meds on time, but no one cared to inform me about long term prognosis or how the meds work or anything, absolutely anything, no information!! She set a 5 years waiting window but she didn't inform ME!! just my parents and they, of course, didn't speak to me...I was heartbroken because now I may have lost that chance...

My doctor put me on the maximum dose of the same shit med, then tried a very expensive new one, and after no result, she put me on olanzapin. Now, I am on 5mg olanzapin for 3 years and haven't had no simptoms.

1. Is it standard practice to just not talk and explain anything to the patient and let them go through hell  to find out for themselves what a psychosis is? Or is she kinda shitty?

2. Can I hope of ever safely tapering off and trying to go off meds and having a normal life?

Glum_Captain123,"I feel immense shame from an event that happened 2 years ago and can't sleep at night, need a bit of reassurance",16,1c5mmsa,5,"TW: depression, su\*\*\*\*\*

Approximately 2 years ago, I (then 17F) had a brief romantic relationship with a girl. She was a friend of my friend's and I told her I thought she was cute, so she arranged a coffee meet-up when we could talk. For context, since early in life I knew I had some attraction to women, but it was mainly physical, so when I realised I actually ""felt"" a way about another girl, it made me excited and I thought I could finally call myself a ""proper"" bisexual (which is kind of stupid but that was my thought process). We went on a couple of dates and at some point she asked me to be her girlfriend - I agreed but in the back of my head I was very hesitant because I knew my family is strongly Christian and they would never approve. I was naive and swooped in the moment and didn't think about the potential consequences.

From that day on, I started losing attraction - it's actually a pattern of mine which I wasn't fully aware of back then - I start to lose interest in a relationship whenever it gets serious. At some point, I became so scared (I no longer wanted to see the girl, etc., felt like I was faking the felling) and confused whether I was maybe actually straight. It was difficult for me to make sense of my feelings - at that point in my life I was very conflict-avoidant and depressed, even su\*\*\*\*\*, I had terrible brain fog to a point when I wasn't fully aware of how bad my actions were. One afternoon, I just sent a long text which said that ""I think I am actually straight and sorry I'm breaking up through text"". The thing is, I still don't know whether that's actually true. Still, when I was in high school, she ignored me on the school grounds (obviously), and the worst part is that she introduced me to her friends, when at that point I was already not sure about the relationship. I feel extremely bad for making a stupid, impulsive decision 2 years ago, and for breaking someone's heart. We only met up for approximately a month, but I can't stop thinking about it, I think about it every day. I feel awful for not realizing how bad this was when I was in high school, and that I still had the audacity to say ""hi"" to her on the corridors. There is a part of me that is scared that this will come out through gossip and everyone I know will hate me, or that she is actually severely depressed because I betrayed her trust. It sounds really bad, but I really need someone to tell me that it wasn't that bad, and that not everyone is out to get me because of it. There is an extra layer of shame because in my family homosexuality is very taboo, and my therapist is on sick leave - I haven't talked to her about this because I feel too bad...",1713290178.0,

fmmajd,"What is it called when your mental energy is suddenly drained, and you're just tired, without being sad or angry?",1,1c64zym,0,"After a few very stressful events in just 2-3 days(very serious events, like the possibility of losing my loved ones in very tragic ways, and other loved ones battling difficult health conditions), I found myself crying or getting angry at the smallest things one day. I stopped and examined the situation, and noticed that probably I have exhausted my emotional capacity. I keep imagining a glass of water that became full with the events of those days, and then the small events were the last drops that caused the overflow.   


  
Now I am not angry anymore, I just feel drained. I start crying at the smallest thing, like for example, a 2-minute delay in deliveries, or having to continue a conversation for more than 2 sentences. I do not necessarily feel sad while crying, just that I can't take it, anything, anymore. It has also had some physical effect. I have no energy/motiviation/desire(I really don't know which one) to do anything I did just two days before. Taking walks, working, counting calories, washing the dishes, etc.  


  
I am not depressed. In fact, I'm in a very good place in my life. This was a sudden development with no prior 'gradual' things happening before it. I do have a history of depression and being on medicine, but it was in the past. I also used to have regular therapy sessions, but since I'm much better, they are very infrequent right now(with the approval of the therapist).  


  
I'd like to point out that I am not afraid of or worried about this phase. During the course of therapy, I've learned to embrace bad feelings too and accept them as natural human developments. I'm just asking if anyone knows what it's called so that I can do some research and do some self-caring to help with the recovery.

I look back at that post and see how much I have grown thanks to many people that popped up in my life. (Same with that one commenter that left such a beautiful heartfelt message that encouraged me to try again) I became a person I am proud of. Recently however, I have not. I feel like I have lost a lot of my support as people grow apart or become busy with life. But it has left me feeling so alone. My boyfriend has been with me through it all and I feel like I see such a nasty self hatred monster of myself come out when I become scared that I will lose him too. I lost so much too early in life that when I think about losing someone dear to me I lose it. And we both agreed at some point it has to be time for us to grow by ourselves for a while but I’m so terrified of losing him. He’s my best friend. He’s inspired and changed me so much for the better. But I hate that I don’t think I did that for him. I hate that I hate myself.

I was so happy, I started to fall in love with life. But one thing happened that I didn’t predict is I had big spiritual awakening. I opened my third eye and I had big realization about what is going on really in world. I began to understand how works illuminati and what they plan to do. First thing what I thought that I should is to tell everybody around me what elites are about to do (because I got this knowledge) and in my opinion if anyone knows something which affects lives of society should do something with that. So I told my family about how the government plans to control humanity with ai and brain chips. Then I did something extremely stupid, because I printed the whole page explaining what illuminati plans to do and gave it to my classmates… But to defend myself I was completely aware that everybody will laugh at me, but I wanted in anyway to touch the topic, even if it means making a scandal. Because at the end of the day the most important thing is common good. So I did it and it was the worse decision in my life, because I had very happy life for which I worked very hard and giving away these pages I gave myself trauma. Many people was very happy with the fact what I did and they use it against me. People were happy that I embarrassed myself. But now lets move on. I was so naive, I didnt change school because I thought that If I got this information and now I know that the school knowledge is full of lies I thought that God will help me to get out of school😭
Right now my biggest nightmare happened, because I was so stressed being in this class. I couldnt sleep, I lost half of my hair. I had long hair and now I have them short like a boy, because they started getting so thin… I got into huge depression. I didnt wanted to go to school in these year because I worked on myself and I hoped that God will help me manifest my dream job.  But it didnt happened.
I truly hate myself. I had depression and I was panicking when I was 16 but I got out of it because I started putting myself together. When I was 17 my life was amazing, I loved it so much, but in these time my third eye opened… This decision ruined my life. Now I am 18 depressed, without hair and very bad mental health… In November I will be 19. I really dont like what I did because I panicked and this one decision will affect next two years. Even if I had best intentions I fcked my life. When I had these realization about evil elites and spiritual awakening I started hating school even more because I realized that we are being lied to even by school system. It’s hard for myself to look myself in the mirror, I just panicked. Please never open your third eye if you are not ready…

730 days. That’s 1 year, 11 months, and 30 days. That’s the last time I self harmed. 

I was never really big into it and only did it a few times before I broke down and told my family and doctor who decided to put me in the psych ward. I don’t want to go back, that’s the absolute last thing I want. 

I really just want to do it again. I don’t know what I would do but I just want that feeling again. That distraction from everything else. That’s all I want right now.

I have major intrusive thoughts which doesn’t help either. When I get upset at all I get these intense pains in my wrists that I think will only go away if I do harm myself but I know that’s not true.

Pinkypiesho,Cousin possibly depressed - how do I help her?,1,1c63a2d,1,"Hi everyone!

I am looking for some advice on how to approach this situation.

I asked my cousin if I could use her bathroom for a shower since I am here for the holidays, but as soon as I entered her room the state of it raised some serious concerns: unkempt, hoarder-y, messy, clutter, etc. the most extreme stuff you could see on TV in which regular cleaning is not enough and you’d need professionals to do the job. You get the idea.

I felt really bad for her and I almost wanted to cry after seeing her room. Her room has never been in this extreme state. I strongly suspect she’s depressed due to her mom’s passing a few years back and she probably doesn’t realize it. I do not want her to be suffering in silence if that is the case.

The mental health topic is kinda taboo in her conservative country so I’m afraid being direct and suggesting to seek mental help might offend her or assume she’s “insane”, which is NOT the case at all.

No_Sprinkles_5614,I dont know… me,1,1c62x97,1,"When i was in my senior high, I had a major depression. I was ridiculed by those around me saying how I was an attention seeker, I was getting thinner (barely eating anything), sleeping in class and at home, flashbacks of traumatic episodes and assaults, crying, and constantly having suicidal episodes. It was a tough time, and now I am in college! I was getting better, I believe I am better. But there is one thing I can’t let go, self harm. It wasnt that a big of a deal to me. Its the only thing that keeps me safe, keeps me happy until it gets too toxic by od, cutting areas of my bodies where no one can see, punching myself, scatching till i get friction burns, stabbing myself till i bleed. I do this when I get overwhelmed, when I get panic attacks, when I get depressive episodes or sometimes, idk no reason. There’ll be times where I feel so happy, i have a really great facade then months or days after I get depressed and when I do, I cant do anything. I cant do any task, I blame myself for everything, all I do is cry. Believe me I try my best to go out, do things I love, but I cant. I cant i cant i cant. 

Recently, i feel like im being swallowed. I have 3 part time jobs, a class, and I dont even know why im taking all these when I know Im not capable of finishing it on time.  But i do it anyways. I have no one to reach out too. Idk where to go. I’m so tired of myself. I hate myself, i feel like idk who I am. I dont understand myself. Idk … me.

I can’t talk to my family about it because they are the reason for a lot of my stress. I can’t talk to my friends about it because I don’t want to put them through that. I definitely can’t start therapy and tell them about my feelings because they would definitely report me for sh\suicidal thoughts. I also don’t therapy would help me because I don’t really want to feel happy because of where I am in life right now.


It is not even easy for me to talk about my feelings online. When I made my first post online about my mental health I had to put my phone down a few times because I was scared I was going to have an anxiety attack (granted I have never had one before) but I think I have gotten better. Even with my anxiety I still like to write about my feelings online because it makes me feel validated and it lets me process my emotions better. Thank you for reading❤️.

I feel as if i will continue to live in this loop forever, never aging. the only escape would be to abruptly end it. not saying i want to but yeah, the idea does still scratch at my brain even after all this time of being ""recovered""

It doesn't help that my best friend never answers my texts, continuously cancels and flakes on things that are important to me. i feel like im just to much for people. I never speak about my problems i don't want to be a bother so i dont think thats the reason she doesnt put as much as i do into the friendship.

newtsdaisies,"I feel like I've been misdiagnosed, but no one listens",3,1c5w20z,2,"I'm not asking for anyone to diagnose me or anything, I just guess I'm really wanting to know if others have been in this position and what they did.

For some context, I feel like I've been depressed/anxious my whole life. I've had some particularly traumatic experiences that caused me to develop ptsd later on too, all three of which I've received treatment for.

I started therapy + meds nearly seven years ago. I went through, in that time, seven therapists as well all of which left the job except for one who I switched from because I was uncomfortable seeing a male therapist. For those entire 7 years, I saw a psychiatrist as well and have been on \~10 medications from different 'families' of drugs. Most of which I had allergic reactions to (head-to-toe hives) or caused bad side effects. Around 3-4 years ago (please forgive me, I have a really hard time with conceptualizing the passage of time and am terrible at giving exact amounts of time between events) I was put on a pair of medications that helped for a little while and then after about a year I was back in a terrible place mentally where they weren't helping at all.

I went back to the psych and we tried something else, it had side affects, and then she straight up told me she has one more thing to try and if that didn't work there was nothing else she could do for me and that was... really devastating to hear. She told me that I had treatment-resistant depression and when I, in tears, asked her what that meant I was supposed to do, she kind of sarcastically told me to try electro-shock therapy if this didn't work out.Thankfully, she put me on cymbalta + wellbutrin together and for again, near a year, I was doing better and better. I finally had a great therapist who actually listened to me and helped me and then about 2 years into having therapy with her, I felt like I was in a place where I wasn't gaining anything more from therapy and she was also leaving the job.

That was five months ago.

Currently I'm back to where I was the first time my meds stopped working. I can't function, I can't focus, I'm up and down constantly and the downs are always intense.

I currently no longer see the psychiatrist because she already said there's nothing she can do for me and I also had a lot of issues with the way she treated me so I had my PCP start filling my medications. The more I reflect on everything, the more I feel like I was never listened to. I brought up many times that I felt like therapy / meds weren't quite working because I felt there was a bigger issue going on and even told two of my therapists early on that I felt like I was suffering with bipolar disorder. Both immediately brushed it off without questioning me on anything or even asking why I felt that way and they were my first two therapists, after that I never felt comfortable to bring it up again.

Because of these experiences, there were a lot of things trauma-wise that I never brought up to ANY other therapists until my last therapist and even still I was too afraid to open up about my ED with her.

Now I'm in a situation where I have nowhere to go and no one I can see because I'm currently unemployed (no money and no insurance) and have not been able to get hired in the past 4 months even though I have applied to 100+ jobs (I wish I was kidding) which as you can imagine isn't helping anything. I can go back to the place I was before but the only psychiatrist that works there is the one  who already said straight up there was nothing else she could do for me and that she was giving up on me and I really don't want to play therapist roulette there again either because they literally CANNOT keep anyone working there. There are no other 'sliding scale' or 'low cost' mental health clinics anywhere near me as I live in the middle of nowhere.

I'm at a loss at what to do, I feel unheard and unseen, and I just feel really exhausted. It feels like I've been fighting a battle for nearly three decades that I just cannot win no matter how hard I try. Does anyone have any suggestions or even just similar stories that relate? I just want to know I'm not alone.",1713313598.0,
penguinlovescoffee,Animal abuse at home. Is it normal to feel this way?,1,1c62sb3,1,"(Trigger warning:talking about animal abuse) I was in highschool when this happened. I’m in my early 20s now and I still live with my mom and step father. I moved in during highschool. My step father shows no signs of animal abuse now but I remember years ago he would hit the dogs we had at home because of his stress at work. He has thrown my cat into the wall before too. My mom and step dad ended up giving them away and bought another dog. I haven’t seen my dad hurt our new dog, and it’s been a couple of years since we got her. I have a closer relationship with my mom and step dad yet I still feel resentment towards them. Especially how my step dad abused them and how my mom and step dad emotional abused me. And his excuse is that back in their day, the elders would beat their pets as well. I want to love my step dad but this horrible past still makes me angry.. and I can’t seem to completely let go even though this is in the past. My mom forced me to apologize to my step father when I defended my cat and dogs when they got abused. Is it normal to still feel angry at him? How can I let go of this feeling?

Eandari1,Betrayal support,1,1c62oru,0,"I’ve been struggling. I was in love with someone. We were not together but admittedly by both sides we were both leaning deeper into the relationship since August. 
We weren’t seeing anyone else. We spent every day together. Involved deeply in each others lives. No sex but a lot of physical touch… massages etc. We have been friends 5 years. The last 2 more intense. 
We are both women. She was straight. I’m bisexual but mostly heterosexual, until her. She was my best friend and our closeness created intimacy and feelings we both shared. 
The day before Thanksgiving she met a man, and instantly pretty much fell in love.. he doesn’t live local so that means she disappears for large amounts of time, pretty much no contact. Tonight I find out she wants to start a family with him. 
There seems to be no acknowledgment on her part that this was a massive betrayal to me. In addition the first two months I went through a hideous amount of slander, making me “wrong” for our relationship. Saying she didn’t want to be with me, but yet she was often the initiator of all of our outings, physical moments, intimacy and flirtation. She has sense profusely apologized for what she said. Over and over.
Knowing she’s with him is torture. Now knowing she wants a family with him.. what do I do? 
I feel like any normal person would cut ties. 
But I feel like I don’t have the right because we were not in a committed romantic relationship. 
She says she wants me in her life.  And understands it’s painful for me.. but tonight she shared this about a family with him, directly after me telling her I can’t accept hearing too much about him with out us healing first. 
The biggest part of my world came crashing down in an instant in November, and I still can’t seem to recover in fact it only seems to get worse. My mental health is severely suffering, and I worry.. this is the kind of stuff that breaks people. 
I feel sick that I can’t step to cut her off completely. Maybe it takes time to get the strength or maybe I don’t have the right because we weren’t “together”.

My dad (don’t consider him my father anymore btw) and my mom had gone through a nasty divorce for years. And luckily it’s over and he’s completely out of my life now, but I will never forget the constant fighting the constant memories of my mom in tears and me as an elementary schooler having to witness it. But the main thing I never forget was the time my dad had beaten me to the point where I think I numb. I never said anything about to this day, I don’t wanna stress my mom out cause she does enough for me already. The way I coped with all of this was self harming and of course suicidal thoughts went along with it.

But another I will never forget was the time my sister told me that she wished I were dead. I never forget that, she makes me feel like I’m a bad sister when I’m trying my best. I don’t know though she might be right i probably am the worst sister.

Ever since my mom found out I was self harming in 4th grade, she tricked me into going my aunts house and they both made me talk instead of a one on one with me and my mom. Somehow though during this conversation she gaslit herself into thinking I was just looking for attention and that I really don’t wanna kill myself, and all I did was agree with her.

She also threatened me along the lines of if I did that my sisters might do what I did and kill themselves to. That was pressuring and not very helpful.

Towards the beginning of the year, I had a history teacher at one point that would touch me (not in anywhere nessesarily inappropriately.) but he used to put his hand on my should and let it linger there for a suspicious amount of time and he would also let his hand linger on mine for unneeded time whenever he or I was handing some to each other. Not to mention there was a whole month or two of him only really checking up on me. And I could’ve been overreacting but I was genuinely a little scared of going to his class. But at some point it stopped and I had never told anyone to this day.

Over time though (talking about now) I’m still not sure if my suicidal thoughts had gotten worse or I’m recovering just on my own. Cause on one hand it not as consistent but at moments it’s a random quiet thought and on the other hand, whenever i fuck something up, the suicidal thoughts are a lot worse and it’s to the point where I actually get close to taking my own life.

Anyways, I have no idea what to do or how to deal with this, I don’t wanna tell my guardian or any other trusted adult about this because it’ll all lead back to my mom and since my mom is a single and a stressed out nurse. I don’t wanna burden her with my issues.

Like I cant make meaningful connections with people and I cant really feel much of anything. I feel empty would be the best way to describe it. Ive tried everything, therapy, exercise, getting out more, socializing more (as much as the panic attacks will allow), but none of it seems to work. The people I call my friends dont really seem to care when I try to talk to them about it and they only ever wait to talk about their problem. Not like my problems are theirs or anything.

I started when a girl I thought Inloved dumped me and no matter how hard I tried or how sad I wanted to be I just couldnt be. I cant cry or feel sad or angry or happy or anything. So I cut myself to feel alove, to make sure im still living. It has helped with the suicidal thoughts, I went fron fantasizing about suicide to fantasizing about cutting myself, so I guess that is an upgrade. But I know that cutting CANT be the answer.

I guess it may have to do with a lot of moving parts happening in my life. Got laid off from my last job about 3-4 weeks ago, am moving out of my apartment around the same time, and just started a new job this past Monday that I feel I might be a little underqualified for, which is def adding to the anxiety.

Anyways, I woke up this past Monday morning and I immediately started doing this little dry gag/cough/throw-up thing that I do when I get anxiety. But I never actually throw up. Both yesterday morning and this morning, I threw up and was (sorry for the tmi) having anxious poops as well. The past two mornings I’ve woken up with an overwhelming feeling of existential dread and hopelessness. I used to get this feeling as a kid, but hadn’t felt it in a longgggggg time. 

I also have barely been able to eat or even keep anything down, to the point where I feel like I might pass out. It’s so exhausting. The anxiety is almost taking a more physical toll on me than a mental one. 

I guess I’m asking is, how do y’all cope? What are some things I can do to try to prevent myself from spiraling? Both in the moment and maybe preventative actions for the future? Should I start drinking relaxing teas in the morning and evening? Should I go on a run when I feel an attack coming on?

I always had anxiety, since childhood. But it wasn't this bad at that time. But as I'm getting older, it's having an upper hand on me. I trip over my words, forget the smallest and most trivial things. Most of all I feel queasy in my stomach and when it gets too much I vomit it out. I cannot eat anything, cannot even drink water during that phase. It's embarrassing me in front of everyone and is having a negative impact on my work, career, relationships etc.

Am I in the wrong?",1,1c61arl,1,"I(18F) very frequently visit my Grandma and Aunt to help them with stuff and just spend time with them. My Aunt, who is mentally and physically disabled, has lived a life of bullying for it, so she is made to stay inside all the time to avoid it. I recently realized just how lonely and boring her life is most of the time, only leaving the house to go to the store, pay bills or go to the doctors with my Grandma. 
- 
To try and fix this a bit, I downloaded a game on her phone(*COUGH*ROBLOX*COUGH*) and played it with her to keep her entertained and happy when she would otherwise be doing nothing. She LOVED it and we would play all day, everyday for a over a week(I'm not joking, from the time we woke up to the time we went to bed, we were playing.) I quite enjoyed it as well and played just as eagerly, but started getting tired towards the end of the week.
- 
I quickly stopped wanting to play after we hit the 9th day and so told her I didn't want to play. She was understanding at first, but soon started pestering me about playing. It was annoying, but I understood where she was coming from and didn't really mind, until now. 
- Now she is CONSTANTLY asking me to play, everytime I come over she asks, everytime she text's me, she asks. I tell her I just don't want to after playing for over a week straight, and she just gives a kinda disappointed groan and begs. I repeatedly tell her ""no"" until my Grandma steps in and tells her to stop. I felt bad and tried to play again, but a big wave of exhaustion washed over me as soon as I opened the app. 
-
It's been three weeks since we last played and she keeps asking constantly to play and it's just making me irritated so now I kinda give a snappy answer and have an annoyed look on my face. She's noticed this and keeps asking me if I'm mad, to which I tell her I'm not, but I am. I'm tired of playing that game and can't play anymore, I can't stand that game now. It's gotten to the point where I've stopped coming over nearly as often, because I don't wanna be bum rushed with that stupid game.

I understand why she keeps pestering me over it, that game is the only thing she really has to stay occupied and socialize, but I just can't stand it anymore. I'm beginning to hate that game and can't help it, but keep getting irritated and almost losing my cool with her everytime she asks me to play.

Today it was just him me and one of our friends in a voice call today. They both know I don't like fortnite. I've hated the game since highschool and have vocalized this many times. Instead of including me they decided to play the game. My fiance seems to do this often and whenever I get upset he gets mad at me. Even once telling me I should just break up with him if I'm going to get upset over a game. 

There is also this game I've been really into lately (helldiver's) and whenever he goes to play it he's already got a party of 4 (max players in one game) and doesn't include me. I'm starting to feel like he just doesn't want to play games with me anymore and it's really upsetting me. I don't know how to tell him that it is though cause I feel like he'll just tell me I'm overreacting. Most days I'm just stuck watching YouTube because all the games I want to play he doesn't.

I’ve felt depressed throughout this time and while I’m not feeling suicidal at all, I do have a very strong desire for this period of my life to just be over with. At my university I have a class with a girl who is the same grade level as me. I have always thought she is quite attractive but now suddenly I find that I can’t stop thinking of her. I had a dream with her in it a few days ago and since it’s been a real struggle. It feels like no matter what I do I can’t stop the thoughts of her and how much I want to talk with her, yet I am completely unable to. Today in particular though I feel it reached a new height. I had my class with her, never spoke to her, and that was all fine and good. But I had to stay after at the university for an event happening later in the night, and had about 2 hours with nothing to do. I exited the building before she did and I felt compelled to sit down along the way back to my car. Then, I saw her walk past me towards another building. I then felt like I really wanted to walk that way. And I did. I grabbed a coffee at a nearby shop and walked over to that building, in which I saw her and a friend studying. I then walked out, and proceeded to wait for over an hour outside the building. I never saw her leave the building, thankfully, but I don’t know what I would have done if I did. 

I don’t have her phone number or any way of contacting her, really. And I think that might be for the best. I’ve talked to a friend about this, and while initially it seemed like just a simple crush, he and I both agree that this seems much more like an obsessive situation. It’s to the point where I don’t want to go to this class because I feel such intense guilt for what I’ve done and how I’ve acted. I’m starting to feel intense self loathing towards myself for this and i don’t know what I can do to stop myself from doing this.

Ok-343,How can i truly overcome childhood traumas?,1,1c60w1i,0,"
I have read a lot of books and research about childhood trauma and how to deal with it, but change is very difficult for me. My father is a very violent man with my mother and us since we were young. My mother also, I know, the situation was difficult for her, but unfortunately, she used to do the same. When I was 15 years old, my mother traveled to another country to treat my brother and left us with him for 4 years. Fear was our way of life. If we went out to buy clothes, he chose them for us, and they were very expensive, but not beautiful at all, and we couldn't object. When we got home, he would be very angry because of what we spent. One time I told him that there was a subject in which I could fail, and we got into the car. He started driving the car quickly, right and left, screaming and cursing, telling me that he would kill me and die with me (he wanted me to enter medical school). I was not allowed to cry at any time. My knees were literally shaking from fear. Of course, he always hit us for very trivial reasons. One day, my sister and I were getting ready for school and we fought each other. He was very angry. He took us to the school door, and when we were opening the car door, he told us to lock it. He drove the car a little far from the school, got out, took off his shoes, and started hitting us inside the car, and we were crying. After that, we went back to school because we had exams. Now I am a 23-year-old girl, I cannot deal with people well. Any job I apply to, they reject me because of my calmness and exaggerated shyness. I always get angry inside the house and cannot stand anything. I know that I am good, but I cannot deal with my feelings and mind. What can I really do?

Hey everyone, I’m new to this sub, and I just really need some advice, so if you have any time, please please read this and give me some advice if you can. So, I’m currently 19 years old and I’ll be graduating with my AA degree from the community college in my hometown in a couple weeks. I live in California, and I applied to a ton of UC’s and CSU’s, and I recently found out I got accepted to San Diego State University. I love love San Diego and SDSU is a great school and perfect for my major, plus it’s much less expensive than the UC’s here in Cali. San Diego is about a 4 hour drive from where I currently live, so it’s not super far away, considering that I had actually previously wanted to go all the way to the east coast for college. 

However, my family and I went through a very traumatic and terrible experience about six months ago. (**Trigger warning for this next part**). In October of last year, my brother unalived himself. He was only 24, and he had depression and bipolar disorder. To make matters worse, he did it in the early morning while me and my parents were awake and getting ready for the day (he still lived at home with us and he did it in his room which is right next to mine). Before this, I was super motivated and excited to get as far away as possible from my hometown and transfer to a university because I have been working my ass off at my current community college, and my GPA is a 3.9, something that was not an easy thing to do, especially with my brother’s passing last semester. Now that I have gotten into SDSU, I want to go extremely badly, but I feel like it would be so selfish to just leave my parents here while I chase my dreams in light of our situation. I’m all that my parents have left because my brother was my only sibling, and I feel so conflicted. I love my family more than anything, but I’ve worked so hard to get into a great university, and I just don’t know what to do.

Brain Cancer  
Schizophrenia  
Brain Cancer  
Psychosis

To many, this might not make sense But this is a list of everything my mind has tried to convince me I have. The first one made me feel like my brain was gonna split in two because of the stress, anxiety, and fear. Brain cancer made me think that all prior and future stuff was because of it. Schizophrenia started due to my fear of it and began full-blown after I saw the reflection of my eye in my glasses thinking it was some kind of hallucination. Psychosis started simply due to nothing bad happening in my brain so it thought I had gone insane or something like that. I don't exhibit any symptoms of these only the general ones and that is just for brain cancer. As far As I know, I think I've hallucinated twice and both were when I was half asleep so idk. My brain feels weird now. I don't feel like myself, Like I've disconnected from my personality which might be due to depersonalization. But I fear with all that has happened I might have formed one of them idk. I don't want to have Schizophrenia and no one in my family has it (hispanic btw). Past few weeks my mind has kept thinking whatever weird shape in the corner of my eye is a hallucination. Now stress feels so distant, I feel like if I show that level of stress again I might faint or something.

According to my husband, (and I agree with him), I refuse to lose in a physical challenge so much so though I willingly let myself be hurt or will hurt others in an attempt to keep from losing. I’m not particularly strong and so I feel like it’d be rather easy to take me down, however, I refuse to do so without it leading to the death. I don’t care if it hurts or kills me and I don’t care if it hurts or kills them. I never back down and have always had others back down because they realized I wouldn’t surrender. Then they stare at me like I’m insane. Especially if they were play fighting, 
 I don’t understand how to play fight. I can only ever take it seriously. And I always take it too far which makes people mad at me. In my mind, I see no point in fighting unless the end goal is for one of them to die in the end. Once you’ve decided to attack me is the moment I assume it’s to the death. 🤷‍♀️However, I don’t get into fights and I’m not a violent person I don’t think.

I was 9 years old when my family moved for the first time. I was so blindsided by it, and I couldn’t understand why we were leaving. We lived in a small town, surrounded by a great community. I grew up in a neighborhood full of kids, I went to school with all the same people, and I was happy. My dad had a great job and my mom stayed home with my brother and I. I didn’t get why we left.

My dad got a better job opportunity that moved us across the country to new jersey. I was so resistant at first. I fought against it, was as spiteful as I could be as a people pleasing nine year old. But eventually I started to like it. I made really good friends and i started to appreciate change. we stayed for 4 years before we left again, this time to canada. I was sad, but at that point I still was pretty spiteful about having to leave my hometown at all. so i was eager to go.

the year in canada was awful. I was 13 and really severely depressed. I went to school, i went to my sport, and i came back home to sleep and do it again the next day. i felt awful.

there were many more moves and eventually i went to a boarding school in 10th grade to be able to have a stable high school experience. I made the best friends of my life there, my actual second family. we lived together, we ate together, we went to class together.

I am in college now and all i can think about are the people i left behind. i dont even think it impacts them anymore. they probably dont think about me. but its ruining my life. i still cry about them, about missing them. i don’t even know if its about them or the feeling i got being around them. but it won’t stop, it’s all i think about. i don’t even know what to do about it at this point. it’s been years. and i still feel like im 12, being forced to leave those i care about over and over again, only for them to move on and forget me. it’s like im grieving people who are still alive

Spirited-Cobbler-154,Why am I addicted to overworking myself to the extreme?,2,1c5vbdm,1,"Quick disclaimer: after typing this all out I realise how utterly ridiculous it sounds. But I want to stress that I’m not making this up or “trolling”. This is very real and I’m really in need of insights, advice and support. End of disclaimer. 

So, I have a remote job helping to build an online start-up. I work from home on my laptop. I don't have set working hours. I just work on the never-ending list of tasks, from creating products, planning content, writing copy, etc, etc. The day-to-day expectation is that I get through as much as I can in a day, and then pick up again tomorrow.

But the thing is, there's nobody forcing me to stop working, so I could just keep going if I wanted to.  And that's what I do. Every day. And every night... What I do is work through the entire day, the entire night, entire next day, entire next night, entire next day, until usually on the 3rd night I pass out from exhaustion/sleep deprivation, I sleep around 16 hours, and then repeat the cycle.

There is absolutely no reason for me to do this. There are no tight deadlines to meet, and there is no monetary incentive for it. I get a flat monthly pay. No bonuses, overtime, or extra pay at all. To my awareness, the only reason I do this is because I am obsessed - like honestly intoxicated - with the feeling of being extremely overworked, sleep-deprived,  and burnt out.

The job itself carries none of my obsession. I could take it or leave it. I know this because when I am well-rested and recovered, I don't feel any sort of way about the work I do. I am averagely productive with it, and averagely focused on it. 

However, when it crosses over to the early hours of the morning - 3, 4, 5am - the obsession has taken over. My body and mind feel like a wreck from working relentlessly through the night, and that feeling is intoxicating. Somehow it fuels me to lock in even harder on my work, and really truck away at my tasks with hyper-focus. It's then a bit like a feedback loop: The longer I do this, the more overworked and sleep-deprived I get, the more intoxicating it feels, the more that feeling fuels me to lock in even harder.

I would like to add that on that first day of the cycle, after waking up feeling normal and rested, I am ""normal"" - as in, I shower, eat my 2-3 meals, pop out to the cafe over lunch, chat to the friendly cafe regulars, take park walk breaks from work, etc. But from that first night onwards, I will work through my hunger until I feel utterly starving, run to the 24h shop by my house, scoff down some quick sustenance and dash back home to work. That will be the only circumstance under which I step away from work for the rest of my time awake.

And if you are wondering why on the first day - when I am seemingly in my right mind - would I even continue to work through that first night; it’s because I can’t help myself. I know those euphoric feelings of obsession and intoxication are coming if I just keep working. And I know they won’t happen if I go to stop working and just go to sleep.

So this is where I’m at. I’m puzzled. I don’t know the reason behind these feelings. I do have a suspicion that it may be ego-driven. As if the obsession is with my own ability to keep working to this extreme extent. But I don’t know for sure. Any insights, perspectives, advice or support is greatly appreciated. ",1713311571.0,

TumbleweedNervous76,Assaulted During Commute To Work (NYC),1,1c5z5pq,1,"In February one morning on my commute to work on the Long Island Railroad to Penn Station (NYC), while disembarking the train at Penn Station, someone shoved me hard into the wall adjacent to the door as he passed me and started yelling at me about ""running him over"", or something. I never made any contact with him whatsoever, but maybe he thought I cut him off while exiting the train, or something else that in his mind justified physically assaulting me. He then continued screaming as he proceeded to walk away from the train, and as he ascended the stairs to the LIRR concourse. I was somewhat in a state of shock and pretty much just continued walking on my way to the subway. This has been stressing me out since it happened. I've been having frequent, intrusive pangs of rage when I think about it, and I feel defensive, unsafe, and on edge whenever I'm in public or on my commute now.  
  
What should I have done? I feel like I failed because I should have defended myself or reacted with a proportionate response, but I didn't. What should I do now? If this person was readily willing to attack an able-bodied 30-something year old, who's to say they wouldn't be willing to assault an old or disabled person for no reason? I feel like I'd be helpless and useless and not know what to do if this were to happen to a family member in my presence like my mom, or future wife, or something. Am I making to much of this?

EstelaStardust,I've been self-loathing for a long time and I find it extremely hard to stop myself. Any advice?,1,1c5ysi7,0,"Hello, before I talk a bit more about this I wanted to mention that I'm new and I've only ever posted once in this website, that time people called me unsensitve for choosing a wrong subreddit to talk about a diferent issue. I don't want to come across as rude or unsensitive again in this post so if I do please know it was not my intention. Also english is my second lenguage in case I make any spelling mistakes.  


So... for a while now I've been self-loathing (though I didn't really know how it was called for a long time) and I feel genuenly stupid and useless every time I say something dumb or make a mistake. I know it's not a big deal at the end of the day, and a mistake won't be the end of the world but it feels like nothing I ever do is good enough. And it doesn't matter how much people tell me I'm smart and talented I feel like it's all lies and that they don't really know how much of a dissapointment I am. Logically, I know it's not true, but I still feel like maybe I'm not who they think I am and that if they were to know the bad side of me they would hate me. It's specially bad when they say a comment that would be normal in their own context where I would have no reason to find it triggering but it just fuels my insecurities to a point where I have to supress tears.

(For context, I'm not very open with my emotions ever since I was young, I don't tend to cry in public unless it's extreme and I know it's a bad habit so it might be contributing with this.)

In the last year or two it started to get worse so I decided I needed to do something about it. Lately I've been trying to be more positive and not think so badly of myself but it's been really hard and every time my mom gets angry about me doing some task wrong (she's not even remotely violent just to clarify, it's mainly just my own head making me feel horrible for making a mistake again) it just comes flodding back in. And it's hard to stop myself from thinking I'm worthless because of the stupidest mistakes, I just want to feel better because I feel like I'm exagerating!

Like, that's a whole deal, I keep feeling the clasic ''well others have it worse, so why are you attention seeking'' and I KNOW I'm not attention seeking because I haven't even told anyone until now but I have no idea how to stop thinking that way. I want to heal for the right reasons, not because others have it worse but it feels like I've hit a bit of a wall with this and I was hoping you guys could give me some advice.

elisamorenoo,"If you are physically ugly (ik, subjective), and you get obsessed with it, is it also body dysmorphia?",1,1c5yse6,0,"Hello! I hope it doesn't sound stupid or whatever but I've been wondering. I know physical beauty it's something subjective many times, though we tend to agree about some things about beauty every now and then with other people, it's still very subjective and it can be impressive how some things to some people may be beautiful while for others it isn't.

But, that being said. If a person it's kind of objectively ugly, sort of speak of course, but has different things that are considered ugly and blabla, that person can also have body dysmorphia if they becomes obsessed about it? 
Because, I've read the description of the disorder and some of it says like ""sees oneself with a certain feature that is bigger/smaller/whatever than it really is"". But what happens when the person actually has something that looks like that person says, and it's not just a perception thing? It's still body dysmorphia? If it's actually there?

Body dysmorphia can be both maybe? When you see things that aren't, and also, when you become obsessed about things that actually are there but it's an insane obsession?

Also, well. I feel like I'm suffering from this. And I feel like that thing where I'm becoming obsessed with things that actually are there -like, Im not imagining anything and its not perceptual-, but it's becoming insane.
For example, I look myself in a mirror and I actually like what I see, but I feel cheated, as what I see in the mirror, it's not what I see in pictures/videos. That thing that we see ourselves reflected in mirrors it's a bummer. 
And I'm hating in an insane way how I see myself sometimes (sometimes because there are times there's a good picture, luckily) on pictures and videos. Like a big horror. 

So I think I suffer from body dysmorphia, but I want to know if it's also considered that when you actually see yourself as you are, physically speaking.

Now, the next step is try to accept the ugliness I think, but I'm having a hard time on that. I hope it'll come with time, I think it will. As feeling sad for being ugly is kind of tiring too. Emotionally tiring, I mean, I'm really starting to kill myself emotionally in this sense and it needs to stop, because it's getting sickening.

Thanks for reading, I've been having a hard time with this recently, and I needed to ask and talk about it.

I've been under the mental health service since I was 16 I am now 24.

I hate to play the victim card, but I have been subject of domestic abuse in two relationships. I don’t know how I’m so dumb or how I allowed those types of people into my life, but I did. One man I was with for 4/5 years, I thought he was my everything. He beat me, cheated on me and emotionally abused me. He was a bully. Told me how dumb and naive I was. I now know he was gaslighting me. He would tell me how much my family disliked me, how they’d tell him these things and discuss how to take my children from me. He would threaten me with my life, or my children, if I tried to leave. He’s threaded me with knives, spat on me, strangled me, suffocated me, headed me and beaten me multiple times. He’s given me nosebleeds, broken my phones, kicked me out of my house with our newborn baby and no nappies. Basically, he’s evil. 
I met the next guy I dated during my abusive relationship so of course he prayed on my vulnerability and used and abused me too. This man is argue was worse. He was 33, I was 20. I know it may not seem a big deal to some but in hindsight, he was preying on me. I was 19 when he first told me he was interested. This man raped me, told me if I didn’t sleep with him he’d share my nudes and sexual content, he moved himself into my home without consent. He strangled me, threw me on my bed and made the bed break. He took my money from me and made my life hell. If I’d throw him out my house it had to be with force but he’d always steal things first so I had to allow him in again. Things like baby formula or my phone charger. He used to force me to take overdoses, convincing me it was the right thing to do because no one wanted me here and the world would be better without me. Then he’d tell me I couldn’t break up with him because I’d lose my kids. I have got a restraining order against him now. 

These men RUINED my life. 

I do not know how to fix myself. My ex keeps making me relapse. Last year it was when the PTSD began which made me a version of myself I didn’t know. It ruined my relationship with a really good guy. Now he keeps breaching the restraining order and I want it to end. 

I wish the people around me understood what I go through. The nightmares I have every night. The way I jump if the door goes. If I see people walk past my fence in the garden. If I see an unknown number calling.

cicatrize-,How to reconcile with the absolutely terrible things I've done in the past?,1,1c5xt55,2,"I grew up with untreated mentally illness, and it manifested in a way that made me extremely reactive, sensitive, manipulative, and abusive. I destroyed all of my close relationships and I just wasn't a very good person to be around in general. And when I added alcohol to the mix (which I often did) my destructive behaviour would increase tenfold. Due to medication, therapy, life experience, and growth I could say that I have changed and I'm a relatively stable person at the moment that has a job, a couple of friends, and a pretty peaceful life. But I can't love myself (which seems to be crucial to the next stage of growth I'm trying to progress into), I can't forgive myself, and I just can't move on. 

Everyday I remember a new way I've hurt someone, and I can't enter into close, deep, vulnerable relationships for fear of doing it again. I intrinsically believe I am a bad person deep down and people would be better off without me. I feel like this 'new' me is just an act that everyone can see right through, and that the world knows my true insidious, disgusting nature. I don't feel like the things I've done should be forgiven, and if someone I love told me that they had done the same things I had my feelings would change about them. I'm terrified of death because I don't want to face eternal judgement, but at the same time I don't feel like I'm worthy of life. I just... float through things now trying not to negatively impact anything around me. 

I desperately just want to be a good person. I want to be worthy of good things, and make a positive impact in the world. I want a best friend and a partner that feel loved and respected by me and love me just the same. I want to help people and be happy and accept myself. But how can I when I've done unforgivable things? How can I move past something that will forever be a scar for someone else? It feels... selfish, cowardly, unaccountable to try and move on; I believe I deserve to be punished, but at the same time I am so so tired of living this way. 

I've searched for answers for this before, and I always find content by someone feeling shame because they had a little fight with their friend and can't forgive themselves (or something to that nature). And it seems obvious that they should learn from this and move on because a good person can still make mistakes. But what I've done wasn't a mistake, it was a consistent pattern of terrible choices that for years I held no remorse for. I've stolen, cheated, abused, intimidated, assaulted. Anything behaviour you can imagine a shitty person doing I've likely done it several times. Due to extreme alcohol abuse, I probably don't even remember half the bad shit I've done. So where does that leave me? 

If you've read this word vomit all the way through, thankyou. I didn't even realise these thoughts were inside me until this morning really, but no I suppose I know while I always feel so heavy. I'm not exactly sure what I want from this, but here we are.

jeongtoot,paranoia/delusions about being watched by family,1,1c5xhan,0,"all of this is going to sound really fucked up and its is extremely hard for me to talk about but i need to preface this by saying that my dad has NEVER done anything abusive towards me. i understand that a lot of this reads like i've been sexually abused or something as a child but i haven't. please don't say anything about subconscious trauma, bc i assure you it's not possible. i didn't even live with my dad for a large period of time as a child.  i also never felt like my dad looked at me inappropriately or thought about me in any way other than as a little kid. i've also never really had any mental health issues until this whole thing started.   
in december of 2022, during my final exams of that term, i'm not really sure why or what triggered it but i began experiencing a psychotic break. tbh im not even sure if thats what it was, but essentially, i began freaking out and accusing my dad of watching me through hidden cameras in my room and bathroom. we thought it was just the stress of my exams but these thoughts never went away even after the exams ended. in fact they got much worse as time went on. i began imagining my dad monitoring my texts with friends, listening into my phone calls and watching me through the camera of my phone and laptop. i started deluding myself that he could track my location because of the devices i always carry on me and that he could see me via cameras that were hidden in the cracks of my walls. the worst is the bathroom - i felt like he could watch me showering or using the bathroom.   
i don't have any reason for why he would ever WANT to do any of these things. prior to this, we had an absolutely normal father-daughter relationship and i had never imagined my dad being capable of any of this. it's just the awful, pervasive thought of ""what if he is, though?"". the feeling of being watched, made me slowly stop doing everything i enjoyed. it was absolutely debilitating. i couldn't reply to a text without wondering if my dad would be alerted of it and read my entire chat. i couldn't change my clothes without wondering if he could see me. i couldn't shower, and so i didn't. i would shower at late hours of the night when i was sure he was asleep. and even then i felt as though he could rewind the recording caught by the cameras in my bathroom and watch them later. i didn't shower for months at a time. when i thought back to all the times i had done things in private in my room and imagined my dad being able to see those things, i genuinely wanted to die. i felt disgusted even looking at myself in the mirror for a long time. it's not just the feeling of being watched that was bothering me. it was because it was my DAD that it felt disgusting. quite honestly i wouldn't give a single fuck if it was some random hacker watching me. as i did more research about hidden cameras and spyware/malware (ex. WebWatcher), i became more convinced because i realized all these things were actually possible.   
things started to get a little better when i moved out of my family house. my parents were able to see how much i was suffering and i convinced them that this was the only way i could begin to move on. instead of getting rid of the thoughts of my dad monitoring me, i've just sorta learned to function/cohabitate with them. i started normalizing the fact that i would change my clothes in the dark corner of my closet as quickly as i humanly could. that i instinctively cover my phone camera and audio receiver when i'm chatting with friends. i still only shower like once a week bc i can't put myself through more than that. i can enjoy the things i used to enjoy but i still feel as though my dad can watch me in my apartment and through the cameras of my devices. i call my parents every night to say goodnight, but everytime i'm talking to my dad, i look too far into what he says as evidence of my delusions. he could say something like ""we bought new x for the bathroom shower"" and it'll keep me up for hours wondering how he knew i had showered that day and if it was his way of taunting me that he knew. sometimes i'll test him and say i'm at home when i'm really not, just to gauge his response. while i do constantly test him, i'm also terrified that he'll say something to confirm my fears, because i don't have a game plan for what to do if any of this is actually true. i can't invite friends over to my place or spend the night at anyone else's because the whole time i feel like he can listen in. i can't imagine even texting or dating someone new, i don't think i'll even be able to get married or have a normal sexual relationship if this continues. i'm not on medication but i did see a psychiatrist who had me take a small dose of olanzapine and I also went to a few therapy sessions but ultimately nothing worked or made these thoughts permanently go away. i feel like i'm going to be stuck in this awful mindset until either i die or my dad does - which is a horrible, fucked up thing to say, i know - but thats how it feels.   
for some background info, i've actually always been very close with my dad and before all this, i would've trusted him with my life. i still would, because other than for this matter he's still the first person i go to when i need something. i'm an only child and i've lived with my dad since i was 14, he basically raised me as a single parent bc my mom was stuck in another country due to immigration issues. tbh i think the reason all of this bothers me to the extent it does is because of how much i trust him, because this would be the utmost betrayal of my trust and love for him. he's always done a lot for me and the fact that i'm having these awful twisted delusions and he's at the centre of them makes me feel so much guilt and disgust that i genuinely hate myself. i know he adores me and the fact that i'm causing a rift in our relationship because of my mental illness is killing me.

A bit of context:
I joined uni for my second career due to bad job opportunities I couldn't find a single one as a pilot I tried everywhere in my country every even in the most remote aerodrome I couldn't find one I'm currently studying to become Chem E. We are currently (sadly) just friends.

Actual story/issue:
So let's start when I first saw her I my first thought was ""I hope I never have to interact with her"" but as soon as I started talking to her I've realized we have A LOT of things in common and started finding her more and more gorgeous (one of her outfits was probably the prettiest one I've ever seen any girl) so we started talking and talking and talking and eventually our trust on each other grew very fast.

So we had a ton of beautiful talks about our life, expectations, love life, etc. We are basically just missing sexual stuff. I've already discover how to know her mood it's in the subtle things when she alright/good she has an amazing shine/glow on her eyes and do tons of eye contact (with me) and also she looks for a reason to touch me, when she's sad/ things aren't alright the shine is gone, the eye contact is non existent and the physical touch is gone. 

So she had a bf (she lasted 3 weeks was with him only once and the only thing they did was 1 single fast kiss) an extremely bad one and thanks to my advice she learned what's a healthy relationship and how to respect herself a bit more and broke things up with him.

Turns out when I told her that if she goes out with him (or any guy really) our relationship will change so she said yes to him and obviously our relationship changed I had to put some limits regarding certain stuff and stopped doing certain things and her glow slowly died I'm not entirely sure if it was due our change in relationship or due to her ""bf"" (I'm pretty sure it was due to our change in relationship). And started uploading sad/depressive sentences every other day on her Instagram.

Well she broke up things with the dude during Saturday, during Monday she was pretty good but today she was a mess (she looked stunning as pretty much always) but her spark was dead beyond repair, eye contact was gone and touching was gone and she uploaded an extremely sad/depressive story on her insta that raised my awareness to the max. 

Now what should I do? I'm seeing her tomorrow and I'm thinking that after class pretty much force her (if necessary) to talk in private and mention pretty much everything I just wrote ""about her spark and how I know how's she even when she doesn't wanna tell me"".",1713315039.0,

washingmachinepikmin,Is it normal to just have... random meaningless thoughts?,1,1c5w7kp,1,"Not necessarily intrusive thoughts, just... weird random thoughts that pop up out of nowhere that leave as soon as they come. It's... a little hard to describe.

Now, mind you I do have intrusive thoughts, plenty in fact and i'm trying my best not to engage with them, but these are different. Normally these specific thoughts are a random sentence that I for some reason imagine, or snippets of a song, or a random memory. It's different to my internal monologue in that I don't intentionally call these thoughts.

Doing some Googling a few hours ago, I came across the term ""mind pops"", and they seem to exactly fit my description, but i'm not sure if a mind pop is just in relation to memories or not, as opposed to general random thoughts that may or may not be memories, as i seem to be getting conflicting answers.

I guess i'm just asking this because i'm curious if this is normal/if they are mind pops or if it's in relation to the intrusive thoughts i've been having that got particularly bad around late 2020 and at their worst in 2021.

Aside from having long-term interests, I am prone to having 'fixations'. Usually it's something really small and niche, and will last from hours to weeks. Some examples are: a certain diving bell accident (now I know every last detailed about it, down to the names of victims' children), a small personal scene from dnd game I'm playing rn (I'm all about this scene for a month already I literally cannot sleep), 3d printing (gone in several hours), a specific esoteric practice (gone in several weeks), a song (I literally shaped a part of my life after this song for a period of time)... 

I can spend from hours to 25-30 days (rarely longer) thinking about this thing only, sinking all of my time into researching, daydreaming, talking about it, unable to sleep because of all these thoughts about the *thing* (but I always remember to eat though, so I'm usually not that disconnected from my regular life), like this *thing* suddenly became my everything.

redpurloin,Out of a two year train wreck of a relationship I still pine for…feeling relief and excitement about new partners but also deep sadness and longing for my ex,1,1c5uxng,0,"
This is going to be a very long read, so I thank all the readers who stick it out until the end. Three people will be mentioned in this retelling: me, my ex-partner, and their primary partner. No one in this story is a monster, and I’m not intending that my readers should think as much. All three of us have terrible traumas which have resulted in us becoming stunted, imperfect individuals who are probably still growing up and finding ourselves. Each person involved in this story has a litany of sexual traumas and unhappy childhoods, all of which influences our relationship behaviors. Though I don’t feel at liberty to discuss the sensitive subject of either EXP’s or WF’s traumatic background, I can go into more detail about my own. 

Dramatis Personae

EXP: my ex-partner, (AFAB NB, ~35)

WF: EXP’s primary partner, the “Wife” (F ~30) 

And 

Me: see below

I’m a neurodivergent, autistic non-binary AMAB woman in my mid 30s, over educated, autodidactic bibliophile. Translation: I read way too many books (mostly non fiction) and don’t easily form human relationships because interpersonal relationships baffle me. I spend a lot of my spare time in the gym working out because I’m physically hyperactive, and I’m also chronically anxious, bordering on paranoid, and exercise is one of only a couple tried and tested outlets I know of for getting this out. I was sexually assaulted as a child, my parents split when I wasn’t yet a teenager, and I was raised mostly by my mother, kind of an arch conservative, pull yourself up by your bootstraps immigrant, and a tiger mom at that, who moved my siblings and I out of the country, and I returned stateside later, to go to college, and I’ve been here ever since. Later on in my late twenties, while I was in college, my father died a premature death after I had stopped returning his calls. He was not yet even of retirement age. What this means is that I am, in EXP’s words, self-centered and codependent in my relationships, and I have a deathly fear of abandonment which means my relationship partners often find me suffocating, and that I care more about preserving my romantic relationships and being soothed by my partners than I do about my partners themselves. Instead of taking care of my mental health and relying on a therapist to help me with these issues, I rely on my partners to do the impossible task of soothing my many disorders. I have been known to make unwelcome texts and phone calls, basically bombarding my partners with too much communication and then accusing them of withholding affection when they don’t reciprocate my level of attachment. So, as I relate what the other people in this story are doing, please take into account the way I am using EXP as a surrogate therapist, and a source of the parental or maternal affection I never received growing up. 

I (AMAB NB~35) am feeling a mixture of intense pining and relief. I broke up with my partner EXP (AFAB NB ~35) of 2+ years on Friday or Saturday. Today EXP seemed to tell me off for good, writing a parting indictment of my flaws on the message app we use and then blocking me, which is the same way we broke up for the first time 6 months ago, after which EXP asked me to take them back. EXP and I both had problems and I want to be as unsparing of myself as I am of them. It’s important for me to mention at the beginning that I come to any relationship with a series of traumas from my childhood and my early adulthood which still influence me and affect the kind of partner I am in relationships. I was sexually assaulted when I was a child, my parents split when I was not yet a teenager (I lived with my mother thereafter and she moved my siblings and I to another country) and later my father died (a relatively young man, he was not yet retirement age) shortly after I refused to take his calls anymore. You can read above how this influences my own behavior.  

This relationship began quite disastrously from the jump, yet for reasons I’ll get into below I was mesmerized by EXP and addicted to them from the moment we exchanged messages on the app where we met. We bonded over the fact that we were somewhat reticent and antisocial  neurodivergent millennials with way too much education. EXP has a background in psychology and so taught me a lot of things I didn’t understand about why people are as they are, and why I was the way I was. EXP also gave me the first acceptance and kindness I had ever known as a trans person who was learning later in life that I was a woman. EXP provided me my first encouragement, to explore transitioning and dressing according to my identity. We both had a history of therapy as children, because our schools didn’t know what to do with us; we were above average in intelligence but suffered from all sorts of behavioral problems. We learned as adults that we were autistic but that the autism spectrum wasn’t well understood when we were kids and so we kind of slipped the net. They and I led pretty identical young adulthoods. We each did an extra year of high school because we were underachievers who didn’t like going to school and facing the bullies and other pressures there. We both started college in our twenties but didn’t finish until our early thirties because of our handicap and a lot of the same issues. So naturally for these reasons and many other startling similarities we had this sense of being kindred spirits from the moment we got to know one another. My partner even resided in the city where I was born and grew up (I now live in another state) and so being with them had this strangely providential feeling, like I was getting back to where it all began.

So needless to say we were long distance partners falling fast for one another. Because we were both broke (I from paying tuition and EXP had student loan debt) I’d make the multi-hour drive out to the state where EXP lived, because it was cheaper than buying plane tickets. When we got together EXP told me offhandedly that they had a primary partner—WF (F~30, who they would later refer to as their Wife in virtually all conversations with me, as a way of asserting hierarchy)—and that they had been experimenting with poly relationships. The first thing EXP told me about her was that they ‘just lived together and kissed sometimes.’ They told me that it wasn’t going so well and that EXP and WF were on the verge of breaking up imminently. It turns out that, though they had many problems, that wasn’t the case at all, and that in our first month together I was already being misled about what I was getting involved in. 

I soon learned that years before I and EXP had ever met, WF—had been engaged to marry EXP and that the arrangement fell apart when WF had gotten cold feet and wanted to call it off. The stillborn nuptial was quietly swept under a rug and thereafter EXP still referred to WF as “my wife.” So, to many people, like EXP’s parents and family members, EXP and WF were for all intents and purposes married, if not legally so. And I was the secret partner who was not allowed to meet the family, or friends of the family, lest that embarrassing secret become common knowledge. Stranger still, though WF had given EXP permission to pursue primarily sexual encounters, she was adamant that EXP could not pursue romantic relationships. But when my partner and I started falling for one another, all that blew up and before long I was having to apologize to WF and beg her to let me stay in a relationship with EXP. 

From then on, I learned that WF was jealous of EXP and had developed a nascent sexual attraction to me. This was always very strange to me since WF claimed to be more attracted to masculinity than femininity, and I identify as a non-binary woman who still has some male parts. I’m athletic because I’m anxious and hyperactive, and exercise is one of the only proven outlets I have for my anxiety, so I think as a consequence of my having a well developed physique, WF had grown jealous of EXP’s relationship with me. WF on the other hand was unhealthy and out of shape, and so I never physically fancied her. But before I knew it, EXP was telling me that I was only still around because of WF’s goodwill, the implication being that we had to sweeten this arrangement for WF. Sooner or later I was being nudged and maneuvered by EXP into entering a poly triad with WF that I never wanted to be in, in order to placate WF and keep her interested enough in letting me stay with EXP. It started with threesomes and gradually evolved into WF and I alone, while EXP busied themselves with other distractions. I remember feeling terrified the first times I had to spend alone with WF. 

So if I put out sexually, WF would in essence refrain from whispering all my shortcomings in EXP’s ear and making a stink about our relationship. To add even more craziness to the triad debacle, I learned that the intimacy between EXP and WF was one sided. EXP initiated almost all sexual encounters, and that intimacy was almost never reciprocated by WF for years at a time. EXP would perform things on WF and get literally nothing in return for it. So when I did my obligatory bit to keep harmony between all three of us, EXP would get jealous and resentful that WF was initiating sexual encounters with me, and was not initiating or expressing sexual interest in EXP. When I told EXP that I didn’t even enjoy this obligation, and that I’d happily stop doing it if EXP would only say the word, EXP eviscerated me and launched into a furious tirade about how I was not allowed to suggest that WF was physically unattractive to me. 

This eventually came to a head one day when I was in EXP and WF’s apartment studying for school in one of the bedrooms. EXP was at work, and expecting WF and I to meet them for lunch. Before we were due to leave, I eventually dozed off on the bed under a small pile of textbooks and notebooks, and I was awakened to find WF standing over me and rubbing my chest and my face with her hand. She bent over me to kiss me and I didn’t protest at all, because of the influence WF had on EXP’s thinking. I didn’t want to say that I didn’t want this, and wind up turning both of them against me, so I consented by opening my arms, reaching up to her, and appearing to invite her toward me. And I let her do what she liked. I pretended to climax so that it would end. Afterward, because it was so exhausting, we fell asleep and missed EXP’s lunch hour. Worst of all the encounter was unprotected. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to lie to EXP about having unprotected sex. WF suggested we didn’t have to tell, but I knew that I wouldn’t be able to keep the secret and that sooner or later EXP was going to be angry with both of us. Later on that happened, as WF and I sat in the living room, with EXP venting their anger at both of us, for both the lapse, as well as the fact that we had been intimate at all, instead of meeting for lunch. When I told EXP privately that I was studying and dozing, and that sex with WF was the furthest thing from my mind at the time that it happened, they told me that they were accepting WF’s version of the story in which it was a mutually invited encounter, and told me that I was lying. I knew then that this was a toxic relationship that I should have bailed from long ago, but I was too in love and attracted to EXP, and I stayed. 

A lot more of this relationship was toxic and topsy turvy, but I still love EXP, and I miss being with them. If they asked to come back, I would take them enthusiastically. I’m relieved that it’s over and I can go on, but I also feel as though all the effort and time I poured into this relationship was for nothing, and that I have a hole in my heart where EXP belongs.

Heispar,Do I Not Have Feelings?,1,1c5uv23,0,"I should start by saying that I can, in fact, express emotions. At times, I'm a bit too expressive with my feelings. Although, there are times when I don't express certain emotions during their time of need.

An example I'll use is a group competition. My teammates are ecstatic about winning it, but on the other hand, I'm very neutral about it. I don't feel anything about the situation. Not only in this situation, there are times when I strongly admire another person--and they reciprocate--but I feel nothing. I'm not happy or jumping for joy. Over the years, I've just learned to accept it as part of my character. I just pretend that I'm as happy as my peers are feeling. It's just easier this way.

I've tried to find reasons behind it, though I've found none relating to this issue(?). The only thing I can string into this situation is my ADHD, though I'm still unsure if it contributes to these feelings. I know that other people share similar feelings and issues as me, but they are unable to describe them. (They are much more worried about it than I am.)

I just want to know if this is a normal thing. Is this an issue I should be truly worried about? It doesn't seem to affect me.

I just need some opinions on this matter.

Thanks:)

I am 16 years old and I think I might be addicted to many things but I don't have any support or anyone who can help me. I have issues with alcohol and nicotine and i know that but i'll deal with it after i fix what is my biggest issue right now which is i think i am addicted to self harm and pills. I have always loved medicine ever since i was a child and I would steal pills from my mom's medicine cabinet to take them. I loved the feeling and I still do. I couldn't control myself around medicine to the point where if I found expired medicine I would take it no matter what it was. I stopped for a while but for a few years it's been back. Back then I had less access to pills than I do now and so the problem is even worse. I can't stop myself. I take at least 2 pills a day often for pain because I am always hurting (specially my head) and pain pills have been the only thing that can stop me from hurting for years. I take so many pills that i am building immunity to their effects and now have to take at least 6 times the normal dose for my weight in order to have any effect at all. It goes beyond that however. I first ever overdosed on antidepressants at 13. I was stressed and sad and i didn't do it with the intention of killing myself but i saw all of the pills i had in my backpack and took them. it was a mix of antidepressants, pain killers, etc. i puked for days but i never told anyone until months later and i still didn't say how many pills i actually took. every time im at a really low point i just feel the need to take every pill i see and specially take them all at the same time or bite and taste them. i hate the taste of pills but i can't stop myself no matter what. today i went through a really bad emotional breakdown at school and not even an hour after i got there i took multiple antidepressants that i stole from my mom. i can't explain how sick i feel and i haven't eaten anything because i can't stop puking. all the muscles in my body hurt, light hurts, my head hurts and I haven't stopped shaking in hours. this has happened so many times before and i don't like the feeling but i can't stop myself i really can't and no one can know so no one can help me. im afraid ill never stop until i take a dose my body can't handle. i don't want to die. my hands are destroyed from me picking at them, i have scars all over my body not from cutting but from being reckless, i fucked up my lungs already, my entire life is a mess, and I am tired of living like this because i really don't want to die.",1713310315.0,

I’m EXTREMELY awkward in social interaction, to that point that I dont even want to interact at all. I have trouble expressing myself.

SEAtoPHX,Not sad about a recent breakup. Is it the Prozac or am I just over it? ,3,1c5l6fh,1,"Preface: Just diagnosed with OCD two months ago, currently taking 40mg of Prozac daily.

I've been in a relationship for about a year, and it hasn't exactly been smooth sailing. Our attachment styles clash—he's avoidant, I'm anxious, a challenging combination. Whenever things started looking up, he'd pull away, creating a frustrating one step forward, three steps back dynamic. These episodes led to intense emotions—upset, tears, panic, overthinking, intrusive thoughts, you name it. It felt like a monthly rollercoaster (exhausting, right?).

Fast forward to this week, and we've ended things for good. Surprisingly, I'm not feeling sad. No tears, no panic attacks, no lashing out. Now I'm wondering, is it the Prozac blunting my emotions, or have I genuinely reached a point of indifference towards the emotional turmoil?

Amazing_Specialist71,OCD symptoms?,1,1c5tscd,0,"my boyfriend (diagnosed w ocd) thinks i may have developed it, but i’m not sure if that works and i’m wondering if anyone here with OCD can relate to what i’m going through or offer advice? (***NOT SEEKING MEDICAL ATTENTION/DIAGNOSIS. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PROFESSIONAL AT SOME POINT***). apologies for flair, wasn’t sure if this would go under question or support? i’d just like to see if anyone relates. 


to start with i am autistic, which i know can often accompany OCD. growing up i’ve had “quirks”, but no intrusive thoughts which i’m fairly certain are just my autistic traits. eg, 

- sensory issues with ‘slimy’ things, once at 12 i touched something i didn’t like and i kept feeling it on my finger despite wiping it off. leading to me scratching the skin off my finger from obsessively itching at it

- i can’t have things touching me because they’re “wrong”. i’ve always always always had issues with people in my room and rearranging things, it drives me crazy to the point of rage, mostly due to everything being rearranged and my space being invaded. but another thing is that when people touch something of mine it’s “”wrong”” now, and i can’t explain why:/

there’s a few more but i’m doing this off the top of my head. recently though there’s been a huge uptick in this behaviour (im not sure if OCD can be developed??) and i don’t know why. here’s the behaviour:

- i have to constantly check my eyes by closing them and putting my fingers where my pupils are supposed to be to make sure they aren’t going lazy or i’m going blind, i also knock on wood 3 times occasionally or count to 3 in my head. i’m not sure why i do this, it feels like it’s to not ‘jinx’ it and to make sure i’ve done the thing properly if that makes sense?

- speaking of knocking on wood i often do that to not ‘jinx’ myself, for example i think of cancer and i have to knock to ensure that i won’t get cancer. i know that knocking isn’t going to prevent that from happening but it feels right to do it, and it bothers me a little bit when i don’t. i have to knock 3 times or 3x3 times 

- sometimes i count to 3 in my head or 3x3 if i can’t knock on wood, this is a new thing 

- i have to lean on the fridge 3x3 times to ensure it’s PROPERLY closed and pull a silly face after

- i often get really worried about electronics downstairs not being turned off, and windows/doors being left open and unlocked, as well as gas being left on(typing this is already freaking me out too:/). HOWEVER, this could just be anxiety as my brother often leaves the door open and unlocked even at night-same with the windows- and there was a time i accidentally left the gas on without noticing. i also have to count to three or pull a face after checking

- i have to turn the tap on twice and make sure the water is ‘right’ (cold, not weird in consistency), i can’t drink it if it’s not because it freaks me out badly and idk why

- raw chicken FREAKS ME OUT, i can’t shake the feeling that there’s germs everywhere all over my food and in the kitchen (could also just be anxiety bc my family tend to not wash their hands properly or wipe surfaces🙃🙃🙃). i often don’t eat at ALL when it’s been used in the kitchen bc my brain tells me i’ll throw up, i either have meltdowns over food that result in me hitting myself hard or i don’t eat at all. which is horrible. if i eat i end up feeling nauseas against my will and gagging

- speaking of food sometimes i’m not allowed to eat because the food is “wrong”. sometimes it’s triggered by the thought of germs or something, sometimes it’s not. i can’t eat from the air fryer because it’s dirty and there’s fat that’ll get soaked into my food, i can’t eat rice because it’s all poison and it doesn’t matter if i cook it till it’s burnt because it’ll get me really sick. i can’t eat other foods because something is inexplicably ‘wrong’ with them.

- not sure if this is OCD? it’s a bit tmi, i have a fear if i don’t pee before bed i’ll wet the bed. haven’t done that since i was at least seven but my brain for the last year has told me i need to wee before bed or i’ll piss myself 🙃 wonderful /s

i don’t know if this is OCD or just general anxiety, i didn’t have a great childhood and suffered from anxiety from age 14-16 but not like this. things have been stressful for the past year and although i’ve been doing these behaviours for a bit (to the point it didn’t really bother me) they’ve recently gotten so bad my bf says that “my OCD” is triggering his, which i feel terrible about. i’m wondering if anyone here can relate to any of these at all? ocd, anxiety, etc.

I am scared to death of going on a prescription for the rest of my life and ultimately I really can't afford a doctor or therapist.

They aren't noticing that im slowly dieing inside. I don't have close friends and absolutely no social life at all. I don't go shopping (the last i went was 2 years ago) i just go to school and come back home. My younger sister is like a great friend but she has her own issues and i dont really find myself comfortable telling my problems to anyone.

The reason why both my parents and their families hated each other was because of class difference and my dad wanted a divorce but my mom didn't. My dad even denied that i was his child (im his biological child and he knows it), my mom hated me because i was somewhat attached to my dad before all this started. When i was 6/7 years old my dad would hit me with a belt and make me sleep on the floor of i got less grades, my mom would say that I dont have intelligence or beauty. My grandma would scold me if i ate alot and if i ate something that was ""expensive"". One of my male cousin who is my age sexually abused me and used to try to sneak in and take pictures of me when i was showering or changing. He even insulted me in school when i did nothing bad to him except that i used to write notes for him, complete his projects, clean his room and help him in studying, i thought he was my best friend.

ayaaku,mental health issues in my high-level sport,1,1c5t8oa,0,"hello,
since 3 years, i actually do a lot of table tennis in a high-level, that we call « semi-pro »
last year, the trainings were very hard, and they were mixed with problems about self-esteem and a lot of negativity towards myself and my body image.
i was constantly.. putting pressure on myself, i think? but i had the cup i wanted.

so, this year, i change clubs, but the pressure is still here. not even only from myself, this time. my coaches favor me, and they always say « you have to win , « win everyone »…

my country struggle a lot with organization of championships, athletes, and it’s so much frustration.
you know, i have so much dreams. i want to do a lot of championships around the world, have a good techniques and gestures, meet new players, and be happy with my sport.
but my country and my parent’s financal situation can’t give me that.
now, it’s only frustration, and i’m not even satisfed by the cup i won last year. my sport environment is very bad.
i don’t know what to do. i’m not happy with myself in table tennis. and with everyone.
my daily life is stressful, because i’m so afraid of trainings. i throw my racket on the table, i scream sometimes, because i’m too angry and disappointed.
i don’t even want to continue going school. it’s like « how can i normally pretend to go to school ? »

sorry for the bad english. thanks for readying, any advice or littles words will help me.

LightningLemonade7,My extreme obsession with a Band,2,1c5nlkc,0,"I am obsessing over this very specific niche Japanese pop/EDM band called ""Wednesday Campanella"". I discovered them around a week or so ago and ever since I have only thought about the band. More specifically the ex-lead female singer KOM\_I. I've been seeing dreams relating to them and I basically listen to their music almost all the time that I am awake.

The obsession affects me negatively. I feel sad listening to their songs (even though the songs aren't necessarily sad) and there is something about them that feels like a part of myself.

I am not Japanese but after this obsession, I really wanted to learn Japanese and move to Japan just so I could meet them and enjoy the Japanese culture. I always liked Japan but this time I am going extreme.

What is going on with me? Is this concerning? This is the first time I'm going crazy over for something so insignificant like this.

p.s. I am currently at a very low point in my life maybe that's somehow related to this?

effs19,Living in Big Brother ,1,1c5swwm,0,"Hey!

This is gonna be my very first time trying to explain this to anyone so please be easy on me. 

I'm doing this mostly because I need to know if anyone else has feel this way? 

Since I can remember I feel like I am constantly being watched by a group of people, something similar to big brother (that's how I started called so), like wherever I go, live or just pass by and whatever I do and say they are always following me and watching me. Sometimes I even can hear the conversations they have about me and my decisions and how they judge me. And this has made me to act in consequently to that, since it started to happen I have become less and less talkative, more introvert, i feel embarrassed all the time and I just can't do anything anymore without feeling judge by those people. The other thing is that depending on the day, or how i feel the people change, sometimes is a group compound by members of my family, sometimes by some of the bullies from my highschool, sometimes even by famous people that i like. 
Since it has been happening for so long I have create some cameraless (that's how I like to call them) spaces, which are basically safes spaces where they are not there, which are usually the toilets or bathrooms. I even only get change there for example. 

I have been in therapy but honestly I was completely terrified of saying this to any of my past psychologies since I was afraid to end up internal in a psychiatrist or something similar. 
But I just can't live my life this way anymore, it's so sofocating and hard dealing with them every fucking second of the day.

I start to stumble and stutter and my thoughts are going crazy it’s like I overthink while I’m talking. It’s hard to control my thoughts while I speak. May it be because of my depression or anxiety?

Every day, I wake up exhausted and drag myself to school/ work. I feel mostly fine, even cheerful while I’m there. Then, the moment I get home, it’s all over. I feel this intense, deep feeling of misery that I just cannot rationalize no matter how hard I try. I don’t have an inner monologue and have total aphantasia , so if I don’t occupy myself with something, I will just wallow in my despair in silence with no way to explain it. I scroll through reels, play games, read fiction manhwa, anything to try and drown it out. This doesn’t bring me any actual joy, just empty momentary distraction. If anything, reading fiction makes me invest into the characters too much emotionally, and feel even worse afterwards because my life feels even more sad, dull and lonely in comparison. Nothing really brings me joy. I tried out different hobbies, but they are so unfulfilling and unentertaining that I start putting on music or podcasts in the background of whatever I’m doing to try and keep myself engaged, and eventually give up. I think my aphantasia contributes for this problem, since it’s extremely difficult for me to be imaginative. 

It’s like I cannot bear being in the present, and am trying to mentally escape anywhere else through any method possible subconsciously. Everything feels incredibly sad, lonely and dull.

Jin-Yunzi,Attention issues (not like you think),1,1c5so6g,0,"Hi, I post this to seek answers to something that's been troubling me for a while now  
  
I don't know if it's the right sub reddit to explain all of this or it's the right flair eitheir so if I should move it somewhere else, please let me know, I wish to not bother anyone, even less by a mistake such as this  
  
English is not my mother language so please, no hate about any mistakes I'd make, just notify it so I can improve with time.  
  
So my problem is complicated to explain and I never saw anyone talking about it on socials or anything near it - I have not done many researches eitheir  
  
I will image it ; there is me, I'll go by ""Yin"" on reddit, and there is ""Saika"". Both of theses names are obviously invented, they just sounded good to me.  
  
I'll give a few infos so it's clearer. ""Saika"" is sort of a character I made 7 years ago when I really started to play video game as a hobby (gaming is my passion). I didn't felt like sharing infos such as my name, age, or anything like this on socials and games so I made up an obviously fake indentity, and naturally, the few virtual friends I have calls me with that name. Saika has a whole story and identity, I won't share it because I believe it's not necessary. All you have to know is that Saika is a bad and toxic person.  
  
I will now talk about my problem itself : I feel like everything I do is in the aim of getting attention. To image it : Yin is Saika's puppet. Saika likes attention of course as everyone does but she didn't felt like suffering through the consequences and second hand embarassment so she created Yin to take it all instead of her.  
  
I feel like I've been designed or created by Saika with everything to get attention - by attention, I mean love, care, but also hatred or disgust. Whatever it is. - Everything is made for that.  
  
To give an example, I'll talk about school. As a lot of teens, school is hell for me. I am that one hated kid in the class who get all the rumors on their back. Not that especially mind the rumors, most of the teens in my school are clones, they all behave the same, likes the same things, same meaningless dramas.. Maybe I am the anomaly there but it feels like they have no personality - at least, they don't display it, maybe to fit with others? Regardless, with rumors comes bad gazes (not sure of how I'm supposed to call it but basically a permanent side eye), and theses makes me feel very uneasy. I am very insecure about my body, I always come to class wearing a sweat regardless of the weather, and my bottom is a bit tight but i'm covered waist to mid-tighs with the sweat (I have severals copies of the same clothe). I also always have a headset for music wich is always turned on and I always listen to something except in class, obviously, and when a friend talks to me. It helps me not panicking too much when I hear them laugh or when I feel their gazes upon me. My grades are miserable as well, like literally. The link with the attention is that everything is my own fault. I, myself, decided to not work even if I could. I, myself, decided to be rude - uncounsciously, I regret it right after all the time- to classmates. I decided to be that weird girl. Even tho it hurts me so much to go to school, because of this. Perhaps it is a need to feel different when I see all them being clones but I feel like from a fair viewpoint, you'd rather be a clone for everyone, and your friends would know who you really are?  
  
/TW : slight mention of self harm & suic!de\\  
  
To get back at the attention stuff, I feel designed for attention because things that could put my life in danger is not an option, blade ""phobia"", can't suic!de nor self harm. And well- Saika prob doesn't want her puppet to fall appart, a dead can't get attention. To keep it imaged : how can a puppet move if it cuts the strings linked to the master? (To be clear : I am not suicidal. I already thought of it some times, but never planned on doing not have I ever tried. Same goes for self harm, except I wanted to try and I still kinda do, but this blade ""phobia"" makes me unable to.)  
  
I'm pretty sure a lot of people are going to believe that I do that for attention and post this for attention. And to be honest, I don't know myself. If I am designed for attention, then it's a possibility.  
  
I would understand any reactions like this, but if anyone thinks of this differently and want to ask anything, I'll gladly answer. I have others examples and of course this is not the only problem in my life so maybe it could help understand. I posted this to seek for potential answers somewhere I know I can't be recognized, and with a lot of people who have differents mindset and way to think - so perhaps will it help me figure something out.

NyanBon,trying to understand myself by typing it down,1,1c5s07r,0,"i've been feeling down these past 3 weeks, no special reason why it'd be this bad but i know 2 things that could be doing it  


i don't know where i'm going with my life, im an autistic 17 year old who skipped a lot of school due to bullying which wasn't even that bad but due to my sensitivity i skipped out probably all of 9th year. which fucked up all of my grades and i wish i never skipped school cause i wanted to experience my teenage school years. now i go to a individual study plan which means i'm just fixing my grades, which for me isn't easy because i should known all the things from 9th year but i dont.

 i dont wanna go to school anymore because it's deteriorating my mental health, but how will i get a job that i actually enjoy doing if i dont study for it? i just wanna drop out and start working

another reason is my relationship

i'm young so i don't have a lot of experience with relationships except for the ones i've had online, i don't think they count though because of their shortness. last year in September or somewhere around there, i started talking to this boy who i've always known but never really spoke to, we only started seeing each others regularly due to new school plans putting us in the same lesson. we didn't start talking before i initiated it, asking for his socials cause i thought we could get along. we started playing games together, i started coming over to his place a lot, watching him play games. i initiated much more stuff than him 

21 December, the time came to ask him the big question of getting together. i'd already fallen for him and i hoped he said yes, i regret the way i did it though cus i'd much rather do it in person if i could go back in time. this boy got me smitten as a kitten, i've never had someone like me like this irl, i never had boys notice me and this one did, but i feel like its only because i first talked to him. i wonder where we'd be if i never asked him for his discord lol.  


the problem comes in these 3 weeks, i've been constantly feeling down, not feeling enough, feeling drained, feelings like my life is pointless if i don't do something with it, so suicidal thoughts aswell. i love my boyfriend so much and i dont wanna lose him. i feel im annoying, him having to constantly comfort me when i'm crying, and reassuring me when im talking down on myself almost everyday. i talk down on me as a joke to cope but i know he knows what i actually mean. i analyze a lot of peoples behavior, and i know when someone changed. i dont think it's that bad and i'm just overthinking but this overwhelming feeling of i'm getting annoying to be around, that i'm boring and he'd prefer someone else has been taking over me. he still says he loves me all the time multiple times a day, hugs and kisses me. everything he's been doing since the beginning. it's only been about 4 months since we've gotten together. i know you can't always give constant affection your whole relationship, but i definitely would

another thing that started happening now is that when i'm at his place, he promises me he'll watch a movie with me or cuddle, basically alone time. he'll just first play with his friends, it'll go 30 mins, 1 hour, 2 hours, eventually i fall asleep waiting for him. i get woken up by him kissing me and telling me he's done playing. i get up and i'm ready to watch the movie, he lays down, starts the film and immediately sleeps. i'm ended up to watchin it alone but i turn it off later because i didn't wanna watch the movie, i wanted to watch it with him. he could stay up for 24 hours with his friend but he can't with me. i don't have a chance against his friends. he prefers them over me, ""bros before hoes"". he doesn't say that but i know he'd choose them over me. because friends are a lot more meaningful than your lover. i'd place a scenario of him having a gun, his close friend and me standing infront of him, guess who he would shoot? he used to spend more time with me alone, but now he's been drifting from that.  


 i'm done writing this. i just wanna formulate my thoughts so i can read it instead of it being scrambled in my mind

jellyfish-cafe,I've some tips for exercising ,1,1c5rixc,0,"Exercise makes a big difference when it comes to mental health. Some people have had their symptoms eliminated. Others have them reduced. So far, I'm the latter. I've trauma, anxiety, ocd and am prone to depression. So far, exercise has made the negative thoughts go from like the experience of someone yelling in your face to the experience of someone yelling in another room. I still have my issues, but they're more manageable and it's definitely worth it. 


My advice:



* Pick an activity you enjoy. You don't have to go to the gym. Hiking, bicycling, walking, dancing, water activities like rowing or surfing, on and on. You can just put on YouTube and exercise. I like the YouTube channel The Fitness Marshall. He has one song dances and longer dances. They have every exercise you can imagine on YouTube. Ballet, belly dancing, yoga, pilates, boxing, you name it. Apps can also make it fun. There is a running app called Zombies, Run that gives you an audio story where you're in the zombie apocalypse and zombies chase you. There are fun runs like the bubble run, mud rud and color run that can make training more exciting.



* Don't make your goals aesthetic. Physical improvement is just an extra and unnecessary. Focus on your immediate benefits like stress reduction, better focus, less anxiety, etc. 



* Don't push yourself too hard. You don't want to dread doing it. Also, a beginner could injure themselves. Start small and build a habit.



* Identify as an active person. If you tell yourself you dislike exercise you won't do it. If you tell yourself you're lazy or can't stick to exercise you will create that reality. How you view activity and especially your own identity is extremely important to changing habits.



* Give yourself regular small rewards. Whatever you want. Just to show appreciation for your hard work and have something to look forward to. 



I gently encourage you to not focus on weight loss. I've been bulimic so I know how easily it can become an obsession. But even not being bulimic it just makes things a lot less fun. Also, your weight fluctuates daily due to things like water intake, food, hormones. If you desire weight loss that's fine. But if you're active and aren't out eating the calories you burn it will come off regardless. Exercise shouldn't be a punishment and it's easy to get caught up in that when you focus on weight.
 

That's all. I hope you find this helpful! ",1713301992.0,

I run a small subscription based service business. I still have 20 days for the next payment cycle to run and my bank is already overdrafted. I’m behind my child support payments. All my shoes have holes, clothes worn out. My utilities have a shut off notice. I’m behind on my business rent.

2. My son, when he grows up and finds out his dad committed suicide, would he think I was a coward? 
I’m an immigrant in the US. And I have no family or friends here to share my circumstances and what I’m going through.
My parents are old and I haven’t seen them in a long time. Also not sure how they’ll take the news of their son passing like this.

For as long as i can remember ive had very little emotional connection to anything (minus seeing other things suffer), i have no motivation or love for my life and being alive is only something i keep at because it would be more effort to get out of it then its worth- i could never explain what’s my reason for wanting out of life as i have really anything i could want. I feel like a fake wherever i go, although i smile along and act like the people i am around, i have no interest in being anywhere or doing anything. I maladaptive daydream where i live a life full off emotion and passion but in my own life i’m just a passenger. I had a brief few weeks of self injury where i felt no difference- only that i was pretending to have issues. There is no enjoyment for me even in things i know i genuinely like, and my memory for what i do day to day slips me by. I have an average but quite distant family, good friends, good grades and a hobby i devote my weekends too. None of this brings me any want to wake up in the morning, i find myself wishing that i’d fall asleep and never wake up due to something that nobody could blame on me as i have a life that i put effort into presenting as normal. I feel like no thoughts ever stay with me, i have a want for any kind of emotional depth. 
Nothing has made me like this, but for as long as i can remember ive had these symptoms.

(Touchy subjects)

I've been having suicidal thoughts so often lately
the past few months.
Just I fantize about being dead and wanting to kill
myself cause my friends that left me in the trash
like I was never their friend.
And talked behind my back like I was invisible
And there was a certain person who took all my
friends and always got me in trouble.
She destroyed my reputation, no one wanted to be my f**king friend cause of her, no one wanted to even talk with me.
No one even asked me if I was OK, Everyone always wanted to get into an argument with me on purpose to get me in trouble, and everyone always pushed my buttons and pushed my boundaries and NO ONE F**KING LISTENED TO ME.
And the friends that cared for me had kinda gave up me, (Cause at that point my family didn't know about my mental issues.) I always vented because my family didn't know about how I was and tried to d**wn myself a couple of times and tried to another time to s**t my wrist but the b**de was to dull.
Everyone gave up on me and my doctors just keep raising my medication when I've talking it for like 5-6 months now and I've been worse since I've been on it, I told my pediatrician, my therapists, my family doctor. 
They think they just have to keep raising it cause I'm getting worse, and I have a childrens psychiatrist.
And he says that he don't know about much about children's psychiatric issues, And he didn't even help me at all and he also said that he only has 1 appointment with people not more than one.
And I'm also scared cause my church (my parents are Christians) and they don't mind me being a lesbian, my church is really rude when you don't 1 THING they don't think is right you can get in SO much trouble.
Like my older brother for example: His current girlfriend at the time. (this was about 2 years ago)
She wasn't really religious and he wasn't extremely at the point either, and two of the rude middle aged guys. (The preacher and one of the elders)
They we're yelling and scolding at him to break up with her in his room, and they also came to our house unattended without asking.
And he was SOBBING, my older brother never cries.
And he has never gone back to the church since.
And whenever I go to a youth group there, the girl leader is always dress coding me and she's not fun, but the other 2 guy leaders are really fun to br around, but that girl I swear she doesn't like me at all.
And there was once a time were I was given a drive back home. (And the people driving me back was one of the people that harassed my older brother and his wife, this was a few months ago)
I was saying how I LOVED watching horror movies and they calmed me down and distracted me cause of how violent they can be.
And they were saying how I shouldnt watch those cause of how bad they are, they've always never treated us nicely.
And I'm scared they will find out I'm a lesbian.
Specific people there make me wanna end my life.
They've made me. (Not physically) wanna try and my life again, and I've relapsed so many times cause of them.
And I'm also scared I might not be diagnosed with something cause I want to be able to tell people what's wrong with me and feel valid about it. (I'm getting assessed for autism) 
And so then my doctors know how to f**king treat me for once.
And my therapist doesn't like labels, and she's not willing to give me validation for touchy subjects and it makes me feel awful.
And I can't make friends, I can't stop c**ting myself. (I've been doing it since the end of November 2022)
And my older sister who has BPD, we are always getting into arguments, she's always saying really hurtful things to me.
Like ""jump out the window for all I care"", ""DO I look like I care?"", ""no come down now or I'll make it for you!"".
She's getting over an eating disorder aswell and she's gets hangry so easily, and never leaves me alone, and she gets hangry to the point of yelling at my parents and my 2 other older siblings. (I'm the youngest at 15)
And we used to be really close, now she doesn't like it when I have alone time and she's always think I'm going to k*ll m*self or c*t m*self everytime I'm alone.
I'm extremely close with my dad, I tell him when I get my times of the months, when I need to vent, and he always calms me down cause we have alot of similar interests and I get alot of my traits from my dad.
I'm close to my family and my brothers new GF, it's just, hard to cope when money is tight and all these issues are happening.
And my older sister is always yelling at me most of the time and it's getting really draining.
I'm getting ro a point where I think it's better off if I end my life.

Nie_-,Heavy suicidal for a year now and want help,1,1c5qxms,0,"
It all started when I was 15. I dont know where it came from but suddenly (literally in 1 day) I felt really depressed and i thought people were ignoring me,… 
I just suddenly shut down and isolated myself from all of my friends from school. I had alot of friends and I was loved by everyone but suddenly 1 day it switched. Then I got deeper and deeper into depression and i couldnt seem to get out of it, it just kept getting worse and worse. In that time I still skated everyday and sailed every weekend. I also came head to head with suicide twice with my suicide note in hand, but then i fell down and cried and didnt do it. I couldnt tell anyone, i was ashamed and affraid. This really heavy depressive episode where i just felt trapped in my emotions lasted for about 5 months with ups and downs. It is just weird i was happy the other moment and really sad the other moment. Most of the time I was depressed. After summer break I picked up all my courage and to go to my friends and just stand and talk with them again. They all accepted me back, they said they thought i was ignoring them. I told them nothing about that i was depressed. The following 3 months everything was back to normal until i got the same feeling as last time and got depressed but this time it is alot harder. Last week i came back and faced with suicide and a note in my hand the same thing happened and i just broke down. Suddenly i dont feel like skateboarding anymore which is my passion. I used to skate everyday and even sometimes wake up at 5am to skate before school because i had dreams of being sponsored by my skateshop. I was finally getting good and i was in my prime but now i dont feel like it but i still want to i just cant to lift my body to do anything. Recently my sailing partner stopped and i also dont sail anymore. Wich was my second passion, we were doing europian championship, national championship,… Now its all gone. I used to play oboe everyday now i cant get my body to do it. Im affraid im going to kill myself. I want to talk to people about my problems but i just cant. I think everyone hates me, i hate the anxiety. I hate that everyone thinks that im ignoring them. I hate that i list all my passions. And i hate it that i can be happy but suddenly i am depressed. This depression is literally going to kill me. And o want help but i cant because im affraid of emotional connections. Please help i actually cant take it anymore and i will eventually kill myself if i dont get out of here.",1713300569.0,

No_Nobody_9586,My father-in-law hit on my mom on Valentine's Day,1,1c5q7bn,0,"Posting this from a throw away account for obvious reasons. Not even 4 months after my dad passed away, my father-in-law showed up alone on V-day at our house, with chocolates and rose. He's a doctor, so sometimes he used to check mom and dad's blood pressure and stuff, he carries the stethoscope and the BP measuring device with him. So that day when he showed up, he offered to check mom's BP, and holding her hand he said, ""you hand is so soft"". Mom was taken aback, and took her hand back. She did not tell me about this for a long time, but decided to tell me about it on phone (because I live in a different country) one day when I kept asking her to seek father-in-law's help on some matter. I just couldn't believe what I was hearing. I did not know how to react. And of course, **mom made me promise to never speak of this to anyone, least of all to my wife**, as that has a very high chance of leading to fights between the two families if my wife does not believe it happened.

So, here I am, having to live with this disgusting truth, cursed to take it to my grave. I don't know what the fuck was father-in-law thinking would happen! Like... WHAT THE FUCKKK!!!! I am doomed to pretend smile at them when they visit our home now, or when we visit theirs, for the sake of keeping my family intact. But I am not that kind of a person, I have never had to hide anything from anyone before in my life. That's why I'm just tired of living like this, specially now that I am back home, because of the birth of my first child, so I have to visit my wife's parents' place several times, and see and talk with him, pretending I do not know what he did. Ugh, what a shit show. Sometimes I feel mom should have just spoken up immediately and told about it to everyone - to me, my wife and even to mom-in-law - whatever happened, we should have just let it happen.

aaron_la21,Can't think straight/disoriented ,1,1c5q6fh,2,"Hi everyone sorry if this isn't the correct sub Reddit but I wasn't sure which one would be good to talk about this. I'm a 17y boy, and ever since I was a child I've had no mental problems up to recently in the last 3 months. I can't even remember how it happened it sorted of just slowly came in. I started getting symptoms of brain fog like really bad, I couldnt think straight like all the time, so I thought I'm probably going down with something so I'll leave it to see but it stayed in my head. It's really hard to explain what im feeling but I'll give my symptoms. For example sometimes I be sitting doing work and suddenly everything around me goes all weird and I can't think straight, I always find myself rubbing my eyes and my eyesight is all weird BUT the thing is it comes and goes. It's really bad in the morning when I wake up as nothing feels real, Im still able to function but my head just ain't there like I just can't think straight but it feels really weird almost like the world is pulsating around me. Again, it's hard for me to explain. It's at its worst when I do sports as I get tired at points and it's almost like my head can't recognise danger or anyone around me. A lot of the times after I stand up I feel myself swaying a lot like my head is spinning and I can't balance. Another big impact it's having is on my driving lessons. I have been learning way before this happened and it's coming up to my test but ever since this thing started happening I just haven't been doing great, even my instructor notices. When I'm driving I seem to just drift off like I can't focus but I can't control it. Sometimes I generally don't feel safe driving like I could easily crash if I really don't try to focus which is hard. Mentally for me it's having a big impact as I think I'm going insane because NOBODY believes me. I've told my parents but they just dismiss it and say I'm not sleeping enough or I'm working too much and do less days, I kept asking them to ring the doctor but they said the doctor wouldn't see me because the symptoms sound stupid and they will only look at me if it's physic problem so idk. Nobody believes me and it's not going away. I'm perfectly healthy, I do sports 3 time a week, I eat healthy, I sleep enough and I'm not the type to get stressed easily so I'm stuck like really stuck.

Bronek999,My gf took Clifton Strengths test and coaching session - now she seems to be keen on following her advice - I'm afraid it will make her avoid looking for actual help.,1,1c5q4bx,0,"First of all, this is a kind of throwaway account, I don't want to take any risks.

For a little background, I'm dating a girl for over half a year now and we wanted to take next step and move in together. As title states, my gf took the Clifton Strengths test. From what I can gather, this is not something that is actually science-based, but perhaps I'm misinformed. The test did highlight her problem with getting motivated to perform tasks. She often only starts working right before deadline, classic procrastination. She is in process of getting diagnosed whether this could be depression, ADHD, or something else. She delays going to therapist, even though she says she has unresolved issues.

So what happened on the coaching session is that supposedly they match coaches and coachees with similar scores and the lady told her she never talked with anyone with score so close to her. They had a good talk and came to the conclusion that what would help her achieving tasks is... more deadlines for any kind of task. Now, I've seen how stressed she is with deadlines and what it does to our relationship so I got skeptical about how it is supposed to work and she got unhappy because she was excited about this session and I criticized it.

Maybe this is selfish, but I have a hard time understanding how setting up more deadlines would allow her to work on her underlying anxiety. I'm afraid she will not look for actual help in working on her issues and instead will make deadlines to be ""productive"" but not actually working on her mental health. Again, maybe I should just be supportive of her choice, but I'm so worried it will lead to more problems down the line. Maybe there was something missing in the communication. Maybe I'm not flexible enough.

So a few days ago, I (17) dislocated my kneecap “out of nowhere”, probably from
carrying some heavy stuff just a minute prior to the incident.

I had a beautiful daughter 2 1/2 years ago but her birth was traumatic and resulted in injury. I have been in a lot of therapy since then and I am dealing with that traumatic experience and other past traumas. A lot of my issues come from an abusive relationship in my late teens into early 20’s. Through this I am developing a real sense of self worth, which I’ve never had before. I felt pretty worthless and burdensome prior to working with this particular therapist. 
I have had the same friends since school, and I have been putting boundaries in place since I had my daughter when I’ve felt hurt by their actions. There have been a number of instances with different friends where I have communicated my feelings due to their actions, with hope to discuss the issues and improve relationships - but I’ve been met with animosity and blame and I seem to be losing people all over the show. I’m finding it pretty lonely, but I am understanding who I am and what my values are which is really important to me. I can’t tell if it is my CPTSD pushing people away or whether what I am going through is normal and I should continue on this journey of alignment to my true self?

No doctor will prescribe a benzodiazepine due to the addiction risk, but I'd really like them for mid-attack. I have propranolol, works great for before I feel an attack coming on, but once I'm in one, it doesn't seem to help. I also have been on a steady dose of zoloft, up to 150 mg now to try to help with these attacks. The doc wants me to go to 200 mg of zoloft instead of trying any ""as needed"" meds for during the attacks. I don't have any history of drug or alcohol abuse. I'm really just desperate for something to get me through these attacks that doesn't involve calling an ambulance!!

  
Edit: I'm not even sure how to describe how I feel during the attacks, but it's extreme nausea, diarrhea, I'm usually shaking on the floor, terrified I'm going to die and just begging for it to stop. The doctor recently told me I won't actually vomit or have diarrhea , that's the anxiety talking..... but both of those things do occur during these really bad attacks, so idk why he said that.

molester3000,My brother saw my sh and did nothing,4,1c5eewj,8,"I’m 15 (f), my brother is in his 30’s. Long story short he saw the cuts on my arm. There were only a few, probably the most mild it’s ever been. He angrily said “that better not be some emo shit” and tried to make me show him my arm. Loudly. In front of my sister. Thankfully I don’t think she realised what happened. After I refused to show him, he dropped it and didn’t say anything the rest of the day. I felt so sick, I couldn’t stand being near him. I was constantly on the verge of tears, just praying that he wouldn’t say anything. That he’d forget. The rest of the day he acted like nothing happened. Not even the slightest hint that anything took place. 

It’s been around a month since and he hasn’t said anything. I expected him to say something. He didn’t. No texts either. As much as I was surprised, I was so relieved. I still am I guess. I mean I wanted so desperately for him to forget. But I have to be honest. 

My heart hurts. He saw the cuts on my arm. And he got angry, made a stupid comment, publicly embarrassed me, and then acted like none of it ever happened. My own brother. I keep thinking about what I’d do in his position. I just can’t imagine never speaking to them about it, never doing anything to stop it or acknowledge it at least. I feel so incredibly unimportant and unloved. I have never felt more alone and uncared for. Yet some part of me is relieved.  

I just can’t help thinking. If he had hugged me. Told me that it would be okay. That I don’t have to do this. That he loved me. Anything at all. Or nothing. Not a word. If he had just held me. If I had just felt loved for even a moment. I don’t think I would have had the strength to pick up a blade ever again. But I have. And I can’t fool myself into believing there’s an end in sight anymore. And it devastates me.",1713269106.0,
Blin_Clinton,"My wife(30f) is unhappy, hates almost everything and I (32M) don't know what to do",1,1c5p3vm,0,"

I met my wife during the pandemic, she lived two hours away in Canada. I liked that she seemed very chill, and despite the border closure we met up at a park on the border where it was allowed to hang out. We did this for a year and a half, and because she put up with that adversity I thought we could do anything. When it came to just hanging out, cuddling, enjoying weed together, making each other laugh i thought we were compatible. When she is in a good mood she can be funny, nice, playful, and generous.We got married two years ago and it's been challenging.

I'm Hispanic and fairly extroverted. I like get togethers with friends, participating in orgs, going out at night, but also appreciate my alone time. While the border was closed I couldn't wait to include her in my activities, and she humored my ideas. I've come to realize that she had very little interest in these things. She comes from a Chinese background, has really severe adhd, depression and an avoidant personality. It is really hard to convince her to come out to things. She doesn't enjoy talking to people. For her, sitting around listening to conversations people are having that don't particularly pertain to her, is torture. She doesn't like loud venues, and I struggle to get her to leave the house because she sees most errands as a waste of time. She doesn't enjoy exercise and despite hating cloudy cold weather, it's like pulling teeth to get her on a walk when it's nice out.  

What does she do for fun? Not alot. She is intensely critical of food, shows, films. She really only puts them on for background noise.She smokes a lot of weed, orders takeout and bubble tea compulsively, and spends most of her time shopping on Amazon for organizers or playing candy crush. She complains she can't do anything fun because she has no money, but when I ask her what she would do if she did, she has no answer. She is mostly ok with me doing my own thing but sometimes she thinks we don't spend anytime together. When I do try to spend time with her, she is glued to her phone or doing projects around the house, can't get her to sit down and spend quality time together. She only eats about one meal a day, and nutrition is not something she cares about.  If the food isn't something she craves, she prefers to just not eat at all. She told me that as a kid she had to go to the doctor because she would only eat chicken and rice and got violently constipated. She hates her own cooking even though I love her food when she does cook. She doesn't like anything I make.

 She has no friends and the ones she did have were also very traumatized asian girls with coping and substance issues. I have tried to include her in My friend circle but she has criticisms of almost everyone, that they are too boring or dorky or awkward (even though theyre perfectly fine people and she generally makes a good impression on them, they always ask me about her and I have to make excuses because she won't come out)

She has pretty much disowned her own family, her dad left her a message asking her to at least check in and confirm that she's alive, she hasn't called or responded to him in weeks and doesn't plan to. 

I have a lot of empathy for the fact that alot of this is mental health struggles and trauma, and her mom passing away during the pandemic.  But she is miserable and her coping is not productive. I have no problem with weed in and of itself, it's been life-changing in a good way for me personally, but she is using it as a crutch. When we dated she took harder drugs and only stopped because I told her I would break up with her if she kept doing it.  I convinced her to see a psychiatrist and counseling, anti depressants have helped because she doesn't ideate suicide anymore, but counseling has been harder, she stopped going for several months and only just got back.

She was miserable living at home, she was miserable living with me at our old apartment, and now that we own a house, she hates the house and she hates that she spent 100k of her own money on renovations (that i advised her not to do or to delay for a year) that didn't go the way she wanted. She constantly complains that she's poor and hates her job and hates her life and has nothing to show for any of it. But she blows most of her paycheck on takeout, organizers, 3 trips a week to the weed store and bubble tea. I tell her to budget and be reasonable, and she says she can't cope without that stuff. 

I realize that she is never going to like doing alot of the things I like to do and that we aren't super compatible, but I married her. I would be ok with  her being a closed off home body if she was at least happy and healthy, but lately I can only stand so much of someone telling me that our life together isn't good enough and that they wish they had stayed in Canada. Her saying this last part in particular caused me to break down and cry,and she seemed shocked that her saying all this hurt my feelings. I can only take so much and wonder why she is even still here. In one argument a while back , she considered separating and leave me with the house, but that she wanted me to pay her back the 100k that she spent on HER botched reno. I don't have that kind of money. 

Ever since I cried the other night we have been avoiding each other. She apologized for taking her frustrations out on me, but her overall view is that she sacrificed alot and only got my love in return. Her words. Worrying about her happiness and trying to have a good life with her has made what should be a happy life very stressful and tiring for me. I feel like if she was different, or if she has some kind of breakthrough, we could be happy. 

Tl:dr I don't know if my marriage is worth fighting for or if I should just prepare myself for the inevitable separation/divorce. She has mental health issues and I've bent over backward to be accommodating and accepting of her where she is, but it's not enough and she isn't happy. ",1713296119.0,
HotBrick1351,Is it wrong for me to use this as a coping mechanism? Is it weird?,1,1c5p3ua,1,"Is it weird that when I have panic attacks or full-blown anxiety attacks, and my mind is racing with negative thoughts, I tend to watch videos or read stories about people who have died young or around my age? I find it comforting to see how people support each other in the comments, and how much love there is for each other. The emotion in the videos and comments brings me a bit of peace.  
  
As a Christian, I believe that death is easier than life. Thinking about being with Jesus Christ and reading how the Bible says there is so much peace and no more pain or sadness brings me great happiness. It helps me to know that the person who died is in a better place.",1713296117.0,

Every time I have to do anything these days makes my mind and body scream with frustration that I am still pushing forward and I still don't know why, or if it leads anywhere. 

I feel trapped in a loop of menial daily garbage, but I see no realistic alternatives. My brain always wanders to just blowing all my money on a last ditch effort: Gamble all my money to win big and if that doesn't work I'll just earn my freedom by blowing my head off. 

The ONE thing holding me back is my family and friends. I don't want to hurt them, so I stay despite my desire to leave. I wish I could get help, but even my health care providers (who I pay to help me, but don't for some fucking reason) haven't helped. I've had them randomly cancel my appointments even though I confirmed the dates and all I wanted was a consultation for a therapist, but no. I'm not worth their time and effort.

Gloomy_Freedom_5481,Is my gestalt therapist / psychiatrist sus?,1,1c5ns3y,0,"I have been heavily depressed my whole life and as a result lost more or less everything. Started going to a shrink in March who is both a psychiatrist and therapist. He practices gestalt therapy and is clearly more in favor of therapy than meds.  


He started me on lexapro 10 mg, that didnt work much, and he upped the dose to 20. That also had 0 effect. In our last session (after around 1.5 months on lexapro) I told him that I wanted to change to another antidepressant. He suggested I stay on lexapro but add mirtazapine (remeron) to it. I said that lexapro didnt work at all, so maybe it was better to try an SNRI (which in the past helped me and I told him that) or another SSRI. Some of the things he said to me:  


\- If one ssri didn't help you, then another won't either  
\- I don't think you're depressed, it's more like you have some other issues (shame, anger etc) that we need to work on in therapy  
\- Therefore I don't want to load you with drugs  
\- It's also not clear whether SNRI's will help  


I was left a little dumbfounded, as I have been to many shrinks in my life and been constantly diagnosed with depression or bipolar. I didn't even know what to say, as I felt like for the first time I needed to convince a psychiatrist to prescribe me something. 

I mean not living my room, not following hygiene, not talking to people for weeks on end, sometimes skipping meals/hydration, having no sense of hope, being detached from the world etc must be the symptoms of depression, what else can it be? He also asks me strange questions like, is it you choice to not leave your room? Would you like to change that? Do you like it and etc.. I feel like he is trying to apply gestalt therapy where it doesnt fit - namely clinical depression  


I told him that if he thinks that way he should diagnose me so that we have a proper treatment. And said that I would go all in with therapy and no meds if I didn't have to hold down a job. But in my current situation I need fast results in parallel with therapy.   
I constantly feel that he doesn't click with me talking about ""depression"" and prefers more to talk about things like shame, guilt, anger etc (I dont deny having those, but they come together and result in depression). And I didn't understand what to make of him saying that he thinks I'm depressed (I've thought of myself as of a depressed person for the past 14-15 years.

Oddity_266,I freeze when I am faced with decision,1,1c5nnfr,0,"So this is literally the story of my life. I have spent probably 2 months applying for a masters program in a different city. I was excited about going to a new city, going back to school, building a new foundation for opportunities, meeting new people. 

And well... i got in. I have researched opportunities for funding and know i will probably get it. I have talked to my job and I know that i will be a able to go on leave and then come back. I even have figured our where I will live. The conditions will never be more perfect.

And now i am having cold feet. I am thinking this was a horrible idea, this will leave stranden and broke somewhere, it will ruin me economically, the degree is useless, no one else goes on leave for a masters because it is a terrible idea, and i will be one of those people who lost everything and live in loneliness and poverty due to one bad decision. I am thinking that i always have idiotic ideas because i cannot think properly. I am literally considering to withdraw the leave application. I am constantly nauseas, i wake up randomly at night with a lump in my throat. I cannot focus on anything. I am tense. I spend hours every aspect of every possible outcome, every reason why this is not a good idea, every program i could have applied for instead. 

Worst thing is, this is a pattern. I have been in almost identical situations before and withdrawn from exciting opportunities that would make me grow. And in hindsight, i regretted missing the opportunity deeply and wondered what i even was scared of. I have been beating myself up for letting go of opportunities, but now that i can make it right, get out there, grow personally and proffesionally, my whole system is telling me that this is dangerous. I have always been an over-thinker and risk averse, and grew up over-protected, but this is not normal.

I did stand out from everyone else with my fashion sense and the way I generally expressed myself but that never was a problem earlier in life. I was actually praised and strangely worshiped for it. Once the neglect started to settle in I felt worse and worse by every single day. By 6th grade I had already made my plan for taking my life. I was planning on slitning my arms, legs, stomach, throat and then hang myself to either die form blood loss or strangulation.
I would write in my journal on how at peace I'd feel when I finally did it. But I never did, I never got the energy to take action. ""I'll eventually do it, it will happen some day."" Thats what I told myself every time I thought about it. Slowly but surely it started to disappear and I never thought about taking my life or that this event even happened. Until last night.
I was lying in bed doom scrolling on my phone when I suddenly remember everything. The nights I spent crying, the numb feeling that haunted me through out my daily life and my plan to end it all. I remember how homeless I felt, how I alone I once was. 
I can't describe how proud I am to actually come this far. That Im not the one whos gonna be responsible for my own death. That I do not dread getting out of bed in the morning. That I actually have friends and that I feel something. I know now what genuine happiness feels like, something I'd never thought I'd feel ever again.
I never believed quotes like ""it gets better"", ""you're not alone"" blah blah blah and so on, but now I do know that it does actually get better and that there are others who struggle or have struggled too.

Dotdotdut,What’s this feeling on my chest? How do I deal with it?,1,1c5mr86,0,"Anxiety? Shame? Guilt? I can’t identify what I am feeling at the moment and it really annoys me. It is more or less where my neck and chest connect and it’s a feeling I can’t seem to turn off. I think I know when it started. I was going though a rough patch and was watching series as an escape. Then I spoiled myself and felt like I can’t even have this one moment of peace in my life. And I’ve become extremely sensitive after that.  
  
It is fucking frustrating to live so hypervigilant about everything. Granted, no one likes spoilers, but the level to which I freak out makes absolutely no sense. And it hurts so deeply every time. Another consequence of that is my brain trying to link a bad experience I just had with an object/series/whatever that I like and ruins it for me. Suppose I had an argument the same day I’d bought a book I was really looking forward to. Now, I can’t help but be reminded of the bitter taste thatt he argument left me whenever I look at the book. I can only relate this to the tainted memories of the people going through divorces.  
  
I end up in this horrible cycle: I fuck up, I feel bad, I want to avoid this horrible feeling, become reckless, do something dumb, fuck up more, feel worse, etc, you get the idea. And the fuck ups aren’t even that significant, I know it’s me blowing things out of proportion. But then again, I can’t help it. I can feel my mind trying to connect this bad sensation to something I value. And sometimes I just do nothing in order to avoid the connection, but I can’t just do nothing all the time.  
  
I’ve been going to a therapist for over a year now and it has helped me a lot, but I feel that there’s an underlying problem that I can’t see or understand and I just want to rip it out of my chest. I also used to repress a lot of negative emotions in the past, so that’s definitely something I take into account. I’ve applied the techniques but they either don’t seem to work anymore or take too long. Some months ago I could deal with some of my thoughts but it exhausted me too much and my mind kept making up problem, so my efforts felt kinda pointless.  
  
I can’t be the first or the only one going through this. Please, if someone knows how to label it or how to alleviate these symptoms, any advice in general, I would greatly appreciate it. I will obviously talk this with my therapist, but I thought some more opinions on this would be helpful.

I start doing something with high interest but a bit further I just can't seem to continue. I know I am capable of accomplishing the task but somehow I just can't. I feel anxious about finishing it and then shift to something else and same thing repeats.

And so I keel shifting my goals and aims in life and I feel intensely when I am focusing on something, like I will plan 10 years down the lane but I eventually shift to something else and do the same down that path. I kinda feel exhausted due to this and as a result I don't actually accomplish anything.

I am unsure why she throws a lot of things out when she gets upset, given she does so without any regard to what she or others in the house wants, although she does avoid throwing out things that only belong to someone else but not things owned collectively.

For a long time I've hated him. I still can't wrap my head around how my mom still loves him. Maybe because theyve known eachother for their whole lives. But other than that, theres nothing to love about him.

These past few years I've been going crazy. I cant talk about my suffering with verbal abuse to anyone. They always say things like ""it's not abuse, my parents yelled at me all the time and i'm fine!"" or ""sometimes parents just lose their cool."" No one ever believes me, or wants to. My mother always has told me to forgive him, that he didn't mean it and acts out that way because of his sickness. In all honesty, I couldn't give less of a shit about that. For as long as I can remember I've begged and prayed for his illness to win over him. He stopped his treatments a while ago cause he's a huge baby and didn't wanna see the doctor, I honestly have no idea how he's still alive. I know he'll pass eventually, and I think about that day everyday. I see no downsides to his death. I'll get to roam my house freely, spend his retirement money, have a chance to finally heal from the trauma he's caused me and so much more. I know this is horrible for me to say and think, I know I am not any better for it. My only explanation is I just don't agree that abusers should live. Someone who physically abused my little brother definetly shouldn't. I hate him more everyday. He's nothing but a slump of shit that rots on a couch eating all our food and taking up space and air. He is nothing but an inconvenience and I honestly don't know why he hasn't taken himself out yet. He's already failed this life, why can't he just move onto the next?

The only con I see in him dying is my mom being heartbroken over it. I don't want to see her like that and I don't want her to feel that way, especially since we already lost someone recently to the same illness. It's not like I understand why she would be, but I'll still feel horrible when it happens. I'll feel guilty myself, for telling her so many times over the years how much I couldn't wait for that day. Maybe we'll use his money for her therapy.

I'm not proud of the way I think. I'm not proud of any of this. I guess I just never got a chance to let out my frustration (since no one ever took me seriously or listened), and now I've been like this for 3 years. I hope I get better one day, preferably soon.",1713248564.0,

Zemythir,Don't know what to do after isolating for so long.,2,1c5fjk7,3,"Hi everyone! To give a bit of a backstory I'm a 26M who's been struggling greatly with my mental health for the past couple years, especially within this last year. I've been distancing myself from family, and have isolated myself from almost everyone (excluding my work friends who I see almost daily at work), and have no idea how to approach the situation of reaching out to others now that I've gotten myself in a more stable position. 

So how the hell do you start a conversation after isolating for so long? Let alone allow yourself to open up to someone. It's scary to think about. I know I've been treating those close to me poorly and want to make amends. But what if I've completely ruined the relationships with people I love and care for? What if they don't want to talk to me ever again? What if I've hurt them so badly and apologies aren't enough? 

I know logically all I need to do is open up a conversation and see where that takes us, but what can I say? How can I start a convo with the amount of fear I have going into it?

KunGa69,I need help,1,1c5ktgy,0,"Honestly, this is gonna sound really weird to everyone, but every time I masturbate my personality and the way I act changes. I've done research to see if I can find an answer but nothing I find helps. This is affecting me mentally as I keep changing each time, and I'm finding it hard to stop.

I'll give an example, one day I was really happy and made good jokes, and the next after I masturbated I felt empty and the way I came across was different until I masturbated again, where it either made me happier or emptier. Another thing I notice is that my memory also gets very cloudy after and I find it hard to remember things and retain information. As a student who is studying for their final exams, this is a struggle for me.

I believe that this theory started when I was younger. I noticed that the way I acted was different after masturbating and I thought that it was a good thing, thinking that if I didn't act the way I wanted, I could just ""reset"" and try again. This theory has adapted over the years and has become embedded into my mind, and I can't get rid of it.

To most people, this sounds completely ridiculous, but for me, it's affecting me mentally in a way that's hard to explain to anyone else. If anyone had an answer to why this may be happening then please let me know as anything would be helpful.",1713285834.0,
Dangerous-College-97,I know this is weird but I need to share.,87,1c4qn8s,37,So I was dating someone for a very short amount of time.

I think this pressures me so heavily because I always felt very scared of not finding a girlfriend for example because when I was younger (14 - 19) I had acne very badly and also isolated myself in my room. I always thought that I was too ugly to get a girlfriend and internalized this to the point of thinking about ways how to substitute that already when I was about 15. Then I got a intensive treatment for my acne at 19 and miracoulisly didn't get very noticable scars and was actually feeling very attractive for the first time. But the feeling of being ugly or like theres something wrong with me never left and even transitioned to other things about my appearance, like that I worry about smiling in an unattractive way, or that my mimic looks unsympathetic in general. All of this didnt motivate me to go out more in my twenties. Now I still have HEAVY problems with feeling confident about myself and making eye contact with girls who even seem to like me sometimes. I openly stared at a girl like I was mad at her when she smiled and waved at me last week. And before that I was even thinking of liking this girl a lot. She fullfilled my inner wish of noticing me and I talked myself into, that she would mean her friends who sat behind me, but I knew that she didnt and she really didnt. This behaviour of myself has been going on for so long. Everytime there is a moment like this I break it apart in my head and sabotage it, instead of trusting myself that I would be okay in trying to smile back at her for example.

Although I am lucky I can be honest with my boss about my feelings most of the time, and they seemed like they’re trying to accommodate my feedback, I believe there are things that I fundamentally dislike about the company that I can’t breathe working there another minute. 

I used to respect my boss a lot, until
I started working for them, I learned more about them and realize there are values I just cannot agree with. I don’t think they care about people (clients and staff). I don’t think they trust us as professionals, most of the time I feel like a robot doing what they ask because our plan gets rejections. I understand it’s their company, but it really makes me feel forced and unhappy.

I’ve been thinking about quitting for months….
But you know the job market isn’t good now, financially this paycheck is crucial. 

And most importantly, I blame myself sometimes. Because I left my last job with the almost same reasons: “I’m unhappy/our values don’t align”. Sometimes I practice a mindset change in myself so I can take things less personally, and just do the job without any emotion. But every time, something annoying,  proving the unaligned values popped up and I wanted to quit again. I’m afraid this is a “pattern” of me although this is only my second job.

I know the company isn’t the best place to be though. Most of my coworkers say the same things but everyone staying is also stuck. Once I saw someone I don’t know on the internet sharing about their bad experiences working with the company before and many comments followed with same opinion, I felt so relieved. I felt like I got confirmation that I’m not crazy.

I even did a tarot reading whether or not I should quit now, and if it’s my “pattern”. The reader assure me if I have a plan then quit, and that the company is at fault.

ChefTy_,I don’t even know,1,1c5jzrp,0,"I wanna start this by saying, this war sucks. You maybe asking “what what?” Let me assure you, I don’t mean war as in physical, I mean the mental war here inside of my head, my spirit, soul, inside of… me. Have you always felt like a failure? Have you always been one to always come up short on expectations? Oh, have you always felt like everything you pour passion into reaps nothing? Or how about always feeling betrayed, because the people you surround yourself with don’t have good intentions? Me either, I haven’t always felt like this, but here recently I have.

 Why? Why is that every time I get motivated to do something, that flame gets put out almost instantly. Why do I never get the flame to burn? Why when I set expectations for myself, I can’t meet them? Why? Why do I suffer with always making mistakes and not enough victories to even that out? Am I piece of shit? Am I really the problem? Why is that I feel like everything I do amounts to nothing? It fucking sucks, I basically feel invisible as a human sometimes. Like I know work is work, but like damn, I be busting my ass in the back, and I can’t even get like a good job from the morning cook? All she does is bitch about something I didn’t do to her standard, and then she goes over the work I just did, (I.e. flipping pans.) Like that’s kinda insulting in a way, because damn I just did all that, and now I feel like my work wasn’t good enough. But not even just that, like omg was I annoying, a real piece of work from ages like 12-22, just flat out a shit bag to not sugar coat. But now I’m 25 and for the past 2 years I’ve been genuinely trying to learn about the world, others, myself, emotions, all that. But like I feel like I’ve come a looooong way, yes I’ve got a lot more to go, but like no one’s proud of me? No one has noticed? Does that mean I’m still shitty? Have I not improved? Like what is it?

  And along with that… Honestly, what is it? Really? Do I stink? Am I ugly? Is it my job? Is it my lack of license? Is it the way I dress? Why is it so hard to love? Well more like find love? I’m not chasing and I’m not desperate by any means, but why have I not found my person? I’ve been told how sweet I am, I’ve been told that it’s surprising I’m single and stuff like that, but if I’m soo sweet, and attractive, or whatever right? Then why? Where is she? Are people just lying to me? Because I feel like, I have sooooo much to give, and not to be that guy, but I genuinely mean that whoever my person is, will love it on this side. But with that being said, where is she? I take pride in my personal hygiene, and I try my best to do well with my funds, adulting isn’t easy. But with that being said, is that it? I have trouble with funds, is it my job, or my spending habits… Ouuhh what about both? Is that a reason to not like me or make you want to approach me? Because I work at Denny’s and don’t have $1M? Is it because I’m 25 having a crisis? I don’t understand, maybe I really am just a bum.

  Speaking of bum, why do I struggle with even getting my day started? I just wake up and ‘ehhh’. No plans, no friends, no nun, just eh. Even when it comes to hopping on the game, or even when I do have plans. I’ll hop on the game, excited to play, but then as soon as I hop on, I kinda go through my games, then the store, then my games again, and then shut it off. Or like I’ll be at DnD ready to play, then we get to playing, and it’s like ehhh I don’t really want to now. I don’t how my mind even changes that quickly, I gotta be stupid or something.

 Ohhhh, speaking of stupid… me! Why is it soooo hard to even get out of a slump? It’s almost like I like being in it, but I don’t, I absolutely fucking hate it. And it’s not fair to others that have to deal with that. People like my roommate D, my friend C, and my co worker I. It’s not fair because when I’m in slump, my mood changes. I’m sad, kinda just moving about. I’m quiet, because I’m in my own head and I don’t want to come off any kind of way to anybody. And I’m just not fun to be around. Definitely not ideal to work with in that mood, because it could make work awkward, some miscommunication could cause problems with food being bad or something. Or what about to live with? Oh god, that’s not fair to be the only one contributing to the house. And let’s not forget what that has to feel like to my friend? Probably a little akward because I sit there in silence, or am just not feeling any game we’re playing or whatever. 

 At the end, I’m losing this war. And I’m at breaking point to where it’s hard to hide my emotions. I’m just exhausted, and with life being hard, with me being an over emotional mess, an overthinker, and with me having lack of self, it doesn’t make this shit any easier. Even more than that, I feel so lonely, and so lost. I know my life could be worse, I could be in much worse circumstances, but it definitely doesn’t feel that way.

Ellie-nuh,I feel like I've lost everyone,1,1c5jvpg,0,"So, Im 16 nearly 17 yo F and im I am in my 2nd year of high school. 

I went to a psychologist once because I had some trouble with friends in elementary school and it didn't help me much.
I think i have bpd, abandonment issues, trust issues and depresion moods. 

Everytime, I found friend i felt like they're leaving me, because they always did. Everytime I wanted them to prove me that they're not leaving me. I had diffrent mindset than now. It was more like explosive behaviour, I acted mad a lot and I didn't know ""my bpd"" was a problem because noone told me. (I didn't even knew it's a thing)

Let's move on to, what happend now. So on high school I kinda created seven members friend group (not just me ofc) and I loved them all but one of the friend group was my favorite person and she was my bestfriend, but I always felt like she's leaving me, because she have a lot of friends and I just felt like she don't need me, im not good enought for her and she will leave me. So I was kinda toxic to her and wanted her to prove me that she likes me and everything. She distanced herself from me because of this, and then I was even more toxic and left me. But I didn't know why.

My another favorite person was second girl from that group and she left me later too..but I didn't even do much to her it was more like her manipulation. When she left me I realized that, maybe i have bpd

Rn my favorite person is my a little older long distance bf and since he's older and is that one therapeutic friend I told him everything. I had my first bpd and abandonment issues conversation with him and we agreed on what we will do to make everything work for us, for our feelings, so neither of us need feel bad. My thinking became much more mature with him.

A few days ago, they told me and one other person in the group to never talk to them again. But I will have to see them everyday in school for next 2,5 year and I feel like it was more like bad conversation and they just wanted manipulate with me.

So my situation rn..i feel like I can't speak with anyone from my family, my bf is long distance and i have just one friend (that one from ""our"" group), I distanced myself from my other friends because im not good enought, I lost interested in doing my hobbies, I have more free time than I should have, I will have to see that group everyday in school for next 2 years and half. 

I don't want to be bad friend and even more bad girlfriend anymore and I don't want to feel useless anymore 

What should I do and am I fr bad and hopeless?

Smol_Chook,Incurable headaches and thinking of suicide.,2,1c5en9d,1,"I started anxiety meds again recently in the hopes that it would cure my headaches.

But it hasn’t. I was hoping it was stress. That this would cure it.

This was the last idea I’ve got. Truly.

I’ve had brain scans and blood tests and eye tests and physio. And hundreds of dollars at the doctors. But nothing is abnormal supposedly.

I’ve started doing drugs a bit. To cope you know. Because it takes the pain away a bit. I feel more normal high then I do sober.

My next option is suicide. Being in pain 24/7 makes me wish I was dead.

Today is day 53 straight of headaches. 

Incurable. Hopeless. Headaches.

Maybe that’s stupid to want to kill yourself after just 53 days in pain. But I’m not a strong person.

And I don’t want to live like this anymore.

I can’t get up tomorrow in pain. And still have to go to work in a haze. Panadol and Advil drugged up because they don’t fucking work. 
Work through hours of pain. Then go home to pain and sleep. And crying my eyes out.

Just like I’ve done the last 53 days. 

I can’t get up tomorrow knowing it will be like this for the next 53 aswell.

annaltac,Battling my own self,1,1c5gzwj,0,"A couple of weeks ago I was rejected by my prom partner. Understandably so, as she did have a boyfriend. It also seemed like she liked me, but maybe I was led on.

I took this rejection personally though, as I genuinely thought I had a chance with her from all the signs she was giving me. At one point I had the chance to make a move on her, but hesitated to do so, as I was questioning my morality. I was also somewhat scared of messing up, and I was listening to my friend's advice who said I should pursue  a relationship with her after prom (so that things weren't awkard). Deep inside though I knew I had to do it now. I wanted to make that move, have that kiss, cuddle and experience a first sign of love. But I never did. That was the only time I could have done anything, and i reasoned my way out of it. My window of opportunity ran out.

This first hesitation lead to doubt and then anxiety.  It really started to show everytime I was with her. I started to become moody and anxious around her, which was not a good energy to give. Prom night itself was fun, but throughout the night she could sense negativity radiating from me, as the only thing I thought about was how to not lose her, even though I never had her in the first place. Basically, I wasn't fully living in the present moment and in retrospect, I wish I was, because how many prom nights are you gonna have in your life?

After prom, I finally told her in person that I had feelings for her, to which she replied with 

""This isn't a good time, you know I have a boyfriend.""

Holidays came around and I continued to text her, until she finally blocked me on socials. And thats it.

Looking back all I see is failure. I had a similar situation with another girl several years ago and I had made the same mistake as I did with this one. I never made the move. I started fantasising what could have been and what if I had done one simple thing like wrapping my arm around her or the touching her on her thigh or plafully tugging with her hair. But I did nothing.  It drove me crazy. The idea of 'what if' made me so resentful not at her, but at myself because I knew i let an opportunity fly by.

To make it worse, I feel like I created a self fulfilling prophecy, where my own negativity drowned out any connection I had with her. And I was fully aware of this the whole time, 

I'm not sure what to do anymore. It feels like I'm stuck in a place of physical tension and uneasiness about my self. The doubting & questioning has only gotten louder over the weeks and it is taking over the way I interact with myself and the world. I don't trust myself anymore. I don't trust getting my work done and don't trust talking to people. i don't trust on planning or thinking for myself. 

Mentally it feels as though I have lost a part of myself, which makes me feel inadequate. This inadequacy is making me fixate on all the negativity in my life and making me feel worthless. Not too long ago I could visualise a life that I wanted for myself and pursue it. Now the depth of my thinking only extends to what others think of me. I am developing social anxiety again and I do not want to go back to living in anxiety and self-consciousness, where you feel like you're surviving instead of thriving.

Reading back on this it looks like I'm overreacting, but I have lost the plot and don't know how to go back to normal. It's like I forgot how to be me and have let emotions take over. Advice would be great right now. Thank you for reading through.",1713276433.0,

Im_fckin_geniuz,She told me “you cause me to want to k*ll myself.”,1,1c5gwme,0,"To start this off, this has been just eating away at me. Part of it is indeed my fault for being unwilling to listen, part of it due to off and on addiction. But, no matter what I do, the end result never changes.

When I was 18 months old, I was adopted from two 16-17 year olds at the time. Around age 4 or 5, the adoption was finalized. My adoptive mother, we’ll call her Kristin, and my adoptive father, we’ll call him Mark, both refuse to talk to me due to an incident on nye that led to me being homeless and forcing me to move 8 hours away (I swear this is relevant).

Preceding the incident, a week to a week and half earlier if I remember correctly (my memory has been deteriorating due to my financial inability to begin therapy), 4 days before Christmas, I came home like normal from my night job at the time (usually between 3 and 5 pm to close, which would span from 12:30-2 am). I walk into my mom and dad’s room after a really shitty night and talk to them after arguing with Kristin over text, per usual. But, something was different about our screaming match this time. Something that bewildered and blindsided me. Something I would never expect. Kristin and Mark are strong believers in Christianity (I am agnostic), and growing up, would constantly push the “drugs are bad” agenda. But, when I walked into that room, something changed….

I walk into the room, and of course, get scolded by mark for being so “rude” to Kristin, which I expected. What I didn’t expect were the 2 dab pen batteries and three medical grade dab carts sitting in her open drawer. That’s not even the straw that broke the camel’s back. One of the carts was a 92% THC cart, the highest percentage I’ve ever seen ever. EVER!! Keep in mind, before we really got into it, she told me it was CBD and even reassured me that it was indeed.

So, of course, I blew up. I was broken by the hypocrisy I was witnessing. I was destroyed by the lies being told right to my face about them. I trusted them! With everything I had. Just for them to prove my bio dad right about them being conniving… 

So, I waltz outside and call my best friend at the time (we don’t talk anymore due to him showing his true colors back in Feb). We talked for 45 minutes until I actually calmed down enough where tears were streaming and only small sharp inhales were audible. I wrote an entire song about wanting to just end it instead of actually doing it. Thank god for that, right…? I wrote for two whole hours, which felt like minutes, and cried myself to sleep at 2 maybe 3 am.

That next morning, 10:30 rolls around and I get woken up by them and told to come to the living room. I was half expecting an apology, or something other than what I got. What I got was another scolding, another gaslighting, another “your mother and I have never done anything wrong to you”. Then those faithful fucking words came out. “Son, you cause me to want to kill myself”. Saying that I simply broke is an understatement. I honestly have no idea how to put into words what that feeling felt like. Numbness, but pure emotion. My skin still crawls thinking about those damn words. Those pitiful 8 fucking words that could’ve stayed where they were. She could’ve talked to her therapist, why the fuck did I have to hear it?? Needless to say, I was quiet the rest of the day.

Fast forward to nye. My brother, their only biological son together, was allowed to throw an nye party, something I would never have been given the chance to discuss with them. And, I get it. He’s a golden child that is by far way more mature than me. I mean, growing up, I was a selfish drug addict asshole. So, maybe it was a long time coming. Anyway, I came home from where ever it was that I went (the memory of where I went is not coming to me), and in the garage are my brother and mark.

Mark spoke up and asked what my plans were, so I told him I was going to hang out with them until 11 pm, then go meet my girlfriend and other friend at a gay bar to spend new years with them (I don’t like drinking often, but the time felt right for some reason). So mark looked me in my eyes and said, “why don’t you go do that now?” So, I restated that I was going to hang out with my brother and then I will go.

Long story short, another screaming match. Another made up story. Another bucket of tears, anger, depression and whatever other emotion came to me. Another pity party of manipulation from Kristin, only I didn’t let it fly this time. As a result, I was kicked out for the final time.

Kristin came into my room after I stormed off and locked my door after Mark and my brother told me what they did. And if you’re wondering what they said, I will explain in just a minute. It’s a well constructed, well thought out lie, so it was definitely swimming for a while.

But, I digress. Kristin finally convinced me to open the door and let her in. She shuts it behind her and proceeds to try and brainwash me by twisting what she had said to me a week prior. She told me that she “REALLY” said was, “your actions cause me to want to die.” So, I blew up worse than before. I didn’t let her get another fucking word out. Not one. I told her exactly word for WORD what the fuck she said to me. She wasn’t having it, and neither was Mark, who happened to storm in after me getting progressively more and more heated. 

It finally came down to the wire and Mark put his foot down and said “get out of my house.” I nodded sharply and said “okay”. I walked in and out of that house at least 6 times making sure I grabbed everything I owned. While I’m doing all this, I’m blatantly talking about everything that happened to my girlfriend on the phone, on speaker so they can hear me. Maybe it was a revenge thing. Maybe it was the feeling of satisfaction watching my narcissistic, piece of shit, sorry excuse of a mother finally showing her true fucking colors in public as I kept the front door wide open. The only thing she said to me after she realized she had lost was get out over and over and over, as loud and obnoxiously as she could.

Before I finished retrieving everything I owned, my brother came to my door, face red as a tomato with nothing but tears in his eyes. You know what he said to me? After how long we’ve known each other? After all the years of building the relationship we have had? “You should’ve never come here.” THAT is the last thing my brother ever PHYSICALLY said to me.

So, I walked. I got in my car, and drove the fuck off, not looking back. Went to my normal spot I sleep at in my car, and tried to cry. Nothing. I kept trying. Nothing. I called my bio mom, talked to her. Nothing.

Then, it hit me. I wasn’t sad. I wasn’t depressed more than I was angry. The feeling I felt back then? It was relief. Relief knowing that Kristin could NEVER be able to manipulate me again, for I can now see through the bullshit. My blindness to it had receded. My willingness to play along to preserve peace had completely diminished, for I had met the REAL Kristin that day.

And, as for what their lie was… Jack (my brother), had come up with the lie that his girlfriend’s parents didn’t want me there because of my age. When in all actuality, they literally could’ve just said that I couldn’t be there bc of his friends’ age group. THAT was the truth, which I learned not even a week ago.

So, to close this out. I am not going to be manipulated, lied to, controlled, or otherwise be told what to do by a GODDAMN soul other than my own. My actions will be based on my own volition, not some manipulative kindergarten teacher who talks about her students more than her own fucking son. I am the one putting myself to sleep at night. I am the one staying up late filled with anger and self hatred that suddenly spawns from nowhere. I am the one that will decide my fate. Not her. Not Mark. Not anyone.

As for right now, I am doing better living with my real mom. Sure, I have spats with my siblings, but that’s normal, right? I have a job. I have my car. I have money. But most importantly, I have a parental figure who seems to actually give a shit when something bothers me, rather than blowing me off. And for that, I’m grateful.",1713276201.0,

Remarkable-Gold9217,very long rant about the clinic secretary calling my parent about me wanting to get help,1,1c5gh16,0,"throwaway account because I know he monitors my main acc. I'm so mad, so so mad right now, I got home and sat down to eat dinner with my father and sister when suddenly my mother barged in and very loudly asked me about if I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist at the clinic, I'm pissed off, my father is very clingy, believes he knows everything about me and my mother intentionally did this infront of him so that we'd end up fighting over it, she loves to cause chaos, he is well meaning but has a lot of mental health problems himself, I probably inherited a few tbh. her plan worked, after barging in, revealing everything, I was faced with an onslaught of questions I was not ready to answer in front of him. 

  
I went 2 weeks ago to schedule an appointment as I have various issues I really don't want to get into with this long ass paragraph. I forgot that it was coming up and to confirm the appointment they called my MOTHER, NOT ME????????? even though I explicitly told the front desk/secretary that my number had ""changed"" this was a clinic I used to go to a lot for an ophthalmologist as a child, its been a while so they asked to confirm my number which I realised was my mother and told them to update it to mine for my account and that that number was ""dead"". 

  
I immediately saw the way things changed with how my father looked at me, it wasn't the same anymore, I didn't want him to find out I was going, I've been saving up my allowance for weeks so I could pay for this first visit with cash, I have a good relationship with him but he doesn't believe in medication or therapy, I tried gently broaching the subject with him in the past but he's completely engulfed with the alternative medicine route, read a Krishna murti/ sadghuru/ any other self help spirituality book (sorry, I really don't know how to spell their names and only hear them as my dad talks to me about it for 4+hours.) as that has helped all his problems, (it has not, I'm his therapist in a way and yes thats another thing that gets to me). medication is dangerous and should not be trusted as it is all chemicals (vaccines are fine tho, in fact he's planning on getting me a hpv shot before I become sexually active, oh sweet summer chile}

  
he is constantly talking about what a wonderful father he is and how he's nothing like his father. but he's far to clingy and dependant on me emotionally, as in SEVERE emotional incest, he isn't a helicopter parent he's a Boeing 737 parent, he searches my room and never lets me forget about it, he found a buttplug I hid under my mattress once, suction cupped it to the middle of my desk and put a post it note with ""don't forget to wash it in between uses :)"" like wow ok, I do, but, I did not need him telling me that but thats not the problem here. I have to talk him down from doing rash things, I have to be his springboard for all his problems since I was a pre-teen. my mother punched me in the head so hard as a child because my father was holding me and she was missed trying to aim for my his head not mine, she didn't intend to hit me and brought me to the hospital so she didn't do anything wrong. 

  
she's abus!ve towards him but no one believes it. they managed to separate legally but still live together because she cant face being alone and people knowing her marriage ended. she forced my father to see a therapist friend of hers that she convinced before hand that he was super bad and needed to essentially be on tranquillisers 24/7 and he did them for years before stopping since it was too much for his body and the side effects got bad so she let him stop. he believes the same thing would happen to me and that id be drugged and rendered a vegetable like he was. but life has gotten too out of hand I cant cope and need professional help badly,i feel like its gotta be adhd btw I cant focus on shit, I never know the day or time, and also my paediatricians used to say I had ADHD whenever we visited for my flu shots.

  
in the end my father is still super mad I kept it a secret from him and that he's the good one and I should only have secrets from my mother only as she's the bad one, but said he'd be willing to help pay for some of my appointments as long as I promise not to take any meds and to only go to a psychologist not a psychiatrist and to stay far away from psychiatrists and that id only be allowed to go as long as he stays in the room with me the whole time. I wanted to be independent and do it myself but it's kind of a win maybe. 

&#x200B;

my dad said maybe the clinic called her since I'm still too young to be doing adult things like scheduling and should have asked him to do it instead next time since I'm not yet old enough to be considered an adult and that they needed a parents consent. 

  
oh also I'm 25M on my second year of college, I repeated couple of times for reasons, also I didn't realise I straight up wasn't attending an entire day's worth of lectures each week for an entire semester and on record they only show me showing up on the day of the exam itself (60/80 so still passed but considered failed as I didn't attend any of the meeting or did any other schoolwork), I only found out on the day I went after the term break, I walked in, didn't remember what classroom I went to, like I went up to one, the lights were off, the air-conditioning wasn't running even tho its hot as fuck out there, thought maybe there weren't classes and I just didn't remember any announcement. found it after taking a look at my schedule again, and the teacher literally pulled me aside to ask what happened to me, even my other classmates where kinda shocked to see me, HOW AM I LOSING AN ENTIRE DAY CONSISTENTLY WITHOUT KNOWING, I'm fucking shocked but also cant remember any of my Thursdays, I just leave the house, step into campus, blank, nothing, nada, then remember getting on the bus home.

kinda wanna yell at something but also kinda wanna crawl under my bed and never come out again, overall not the worst day of my life ",1713275088.0,

NumberOfTheBeast2112,Waking up with bad anxiety every day the past week after meeting a girl whom I really like,0,1c5g5kd,1,"I have struggled with anxiety in the past, but had been doing well in the past few months. I should preface this by saying I ended a 2.5 year relationship back in February. Things had been rocky since the previous November, and I don't regret ending it at all. It gave me huge relief and allowed me to focus on bettering myself. This past week, I met a new girl whom I really like. We have been texting non-stop and have a date planned for when she's done her exams. I get the feeling that she really likes me as well, and texting her has been amazing.  


  
Here's the problem; ever since I started texting her, I have been waking up with bad anxiety that persists throughout most of the day (usually fades a bit in the evening). It has affected my appetite and my overall happiness. I keep trying to tell myself that this is a positive step in my life, something I am sure I'm excited and happy about, so why is it causing me so much anxiety? It got to a point a few days ago when I saw her text in the morning, I felt like I was going to throw up. I met my ex in a similar fashion (online dating) but didn't feel like this back then even though she was my first partner. I do admittedly feel much more of an instant connection with this new girl than I did with my ex at the time, which is maybe why I'm getting more anxious about it.

  
Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to be having to deal with this every day as it is very unpleasant. I have a therapy session booked tomorrow which should hopefully help, and I have been doing my best to meditate or organize my thoughts. My parents have been very supportive, as they also struggle with anxiety but I'm just getting really tired of feeling like this. I told this new girl that I struggle with anxiety sometimes and that I've been experiencing it in the past week (I didn't mention that I think it's because I met her), and she has been very compassionate and supportive about it. I do feel comfortable talking to her about it, but not sure if it would be a good idea to tell her I think my anxiety is caused by my excitement towards getting to know her. I think this could maybe make me feel better, but I don't want to weird her out or anything lol.

Adventurous-Gap8596,Advice on how to move forward,1,1c5g4xf,0,"A few warnings: suicide, eating disorders, and depression are mentioned 

So I’m currently at my second semester at my university as a first year student. My grades have always been fine and even to what I would consider excellent up until two weeks ago. Since January, my mental health has declined significantly. I’ve been to the hospital for OD on alcohol in an attempt to kill myself and was placed in the psych ward for five days. I have a history of major chronic depression, and for some reason this last semester has been extremely difficult to navigate due to my mental health. I’ve lost almost 40 pounds since January and have restricted my eating for almost 8 months now. I’ve also had a history with bulimia and received a diagnosis for ednos when I was in middle school. Anyway, I’m sure you get the point that I’m really sick. I’ve been to the on campus resources for help but at this point I don’t know if I can continue the semester. I’d rather fail each class and start my journey to healing. However, I am also currently on the GI bill and I’m worried that if I fail all my classes it might put financial strain on my shoulders with debt. (I might have to pay it back) The problem is I am so sick at the moment deep into anorexia and depression that I’ve considered the idea that I may need to go back to the psych ward and stay for a longer period of time because I haven’t eaten in four days and I’m seriously considering suicide again while also struggling to live day to day as I constantly feel dizzy as if I’m going to pass out any day now. I’m on two medications and I’ve take five times the prescribed amount dosage for my antidepressant honestly wondering if it will kill me someday. Ultimately, I just wanna be okay. I think I should go back into psychiatric care and get help for my eating disorder and suicidal thoughts. I’m just very concerned about my coursework it’s the end of the semester but I genuinely don’t think I can continue. I am completely fine with failing my classes, but what should I do so I don’t put more financial strain on myself? Does anyone know about GI rules and exceptions?

I live in Ecuador, a country that years ago was very peaceful but today is a warzone between narco gangs and other gangs, crimes happen at any moment and the government seem to be unable to help anyone. Today, a few hours ago, a bus driver was killed by a group of armed robbers in front of his wife, they killed him for no reason despite him collaborating with their demands. Two in the head.

im_raemo,Wasting my life n potential,2,1c5buav,1,"Every time I feel motivated, I say that this time I am focused and disciplined, I will do everything to get a good grade on the BAC, and I won't give up. I tell myself this every time, I've repeated it 6 or 7 times, it's starting to get annoying. I don't feel like doing it anymore because I know I'm lying to myself. It's either I say it and do it, or I do nothing. I think my speech has lost credibility. There's no point in saying it's a war and that I won't give up, that I'll show everyone what I'm really worth, and then do nothing after and make excuses to take week-long breaks or get to a point where I completely abandon my dreams and say I'm worthless and ruined everything. But deep down, I want to cry, and I know I can do it, but I just can't. I keep finding excuses to watch reels, scroll through Insta, or even watch anime. It's destroying me. I'm not consistent in my studies, and every passing day, I know I'm wasting my potential and my path, all the effort I've put in to get here, just to ruin it all for a few reels or chatting with certain losers.



I KNOW I CAN DO IT, but even though I keep repeating it constantly in my head, it has lost credibility. Every time I feel like I'm lying to myself, and I know I won't do it; I'll probably give in to the pressure and my weak morale. I don't have a strong mindset like David Goggins; I give in every time. This last time was for Eid, the problem is I couldn't even be consistent in prayer. Anyway, I messed up everything: my studies, my life, my future. The problem is, I know what I should do, but I don't do it. When I was under my parents' responsibility, I had a bright future already laid out for me. But during my high school years, I made the terrible mistake of neglecting what they were doing for me. Now I realize that when they took care of everything, I made no mistakes. I could have become that almost perfect version of myself, the one I always wanted to be: cultured, speaking many languages, respectful to all, successful in my studies, with a bright future ahead, relentlessly pursuing my dreams. I had everything: a future, a healthy relationship with my parents and loved ones, a healthy body, a healthy mind. I was already speaking 3 languages, I was special among all the people I knew, I was already the model student. And I lost it all because of a teenage rebellion.



What did I gain from it? Nothing at all. I started hanging out with a group of losers who influenced me. I lifted them up but also kept dragging myself down, doing skateboarding, basketball, playing video games – things I never wanted to do. I just wanted to fit in. By rebelling against my parents, I just wanted someone to help me and pull me out of this miserable life where I always plunged into despair. I wanted someone to save me from my depression and all the illnesses that came with it, someone to make me realize what I'm writing right now and tell me that everything would be fine. I was on the brink of self-harm, on the brink of suicide. But where would that lead me? Is my life so insignificant and worthless? Is that all I'm worth? I hate this version of myself, but what happened to me? WHY?! That's the question I ask myself every day. Why did I become like this? From the student with the most promising future to the average guy who's worth nothing. I don't want to continue living like this. I don't want to lead my life like this. If I continue living like this, what's the point? Death is better. I want to be special, make a change, leave a mark. I DON'T WANT TO BE NORMAL. But I always give in to pressure.

I can’t explain how I felt when I found out, I don’t know how but when I woke up that morning I knew something was wrong. I texted her throughout the day with no response until in my last class at school I texted her mom asking if she was ok. As I was walking home I got a vague reply that she was safe but in a place where she couldn’t have her phone and that she was sleeping, I instantly knew something was wrong and dropped to the floor crying. I called my mom and broke down. My gut feeling was proven correct an hour or so later when my friend woke up and told me through her mom what happened. I’ve been a mess all day, I know the feelings you have to have to do something like that and I feel awful I couldn’t have stopped it. it’s been hours and I still can’t think of anything but her. Thank god she’s ok, but she could have not been. This isn’t a sob story, this is to tell you someone out there really does love you. And this is how they’d react. If you need someone to talk to reply and I’ll give you my contact information. ",1713259249.0,

Then one of my friends unalived himself and at that point i thought nothing will get better. İ talked to her again she didn't give a flying fuck. So i asked her about that and she said to me i don't want to hear any problems anymore from anyone and i was like okay but thats a dick move. And she literally stopped talking to me for 5 months.

TheDrunkCaptain,Feeling suicidal,1,1c5f60r,0,"Hi.

Don't really know how to begin this type of text but I will give it a shot. 

Disclaimer: i know how badly i fucked up and that I need help. You're 100 % allowed to shit on me.

I guess i just dont know how to talk to professionals and it scares me that's why i havent tried.

I've been feeling suicidal ideations the last couple of months. It started five months ago when I was out drinking with a friend. 

We went to a party with people he knew ( alot of druggies.)
My friend has always had issues with drugs. I've tried some before but didnt enjoy it so I was always

For some reason i wanted to fit in so I also took the drugs they were taking. It was the most primal rush i've ever had and it made completely rabid.

I sat down In the sofa and there was a woman there (also on drugs like the rest). She leaned on me and for some reason i just started to grab her. She said no and I stopped and apologized. 

Ofc this sparked some reactions from the people at the party but they let it go rather quickly. Eventually i started to get more and more neurotic about this as time was passing cause I realized what an asshat i was to my fiancée and the woman. 

I left the party when I felt like enough was enough (i wasnt feeling good anyways so why stay). Walking home i had delusions that I was gonna get completely canceled and lose everything. I thought the people at the party were gonna let everyone in my life know and make me lose my job etc.

I went home to my fiancee and told her everything and that I wanted to kill myself (i thought it was the only way out of this nightmare at that point, cause i thought i was about to get canceled). My fiancée called my friend and asked what the substance was. My friend told me that the cancel thing was delusions.

The day after was probably my worst day ever. My mental health has been bad but i've never felt like this. I managed to make her feel like shit and also make another woman feel unsafe. 

Ofc it wasnt easy for my fiancée to accept (it still isnt for me). She loves me and she forgave me after time and work. I love her so much and I dont deserve her for this but I made sure to try to become a better person. 

I feel guilt for both the betrayal of my fiancée and also the fact that I made the woman feel unsafe. Its not something i wanted...

Fast forward abit : it took alot of work to even become slightly happy again. Im still stuck in december and it doesent feel real. I did everything i could including reading books,, working out and eating healthy.

Recently i was starting to feel better again after a long time.

However.

My friend still calls me but I can feel a difference in our friendship and he also makes passive aggressive comments. Today i also learned that he told our mutual friends since one of them joked about it. Which hurts me alot.

I did so much work the past months to get out of the trench and know i feel like im back since he's telling people in my life about it. 

I dont know how to deal with this. I get that many people will hate on me for this but I honestly dont know what to do.",1713271421.0,

I haven't been sleeping well the past couple of days due to pain ( I went to the gym the other day. ) I also had a dream, but I do not know if it was influenced by my disorders. My dream consisted of a traveler, moving through different dimensions within time, space, and reality. Entering through various different doors, as he is running from an entity that kinda resembled a black pea pod with long and thin tendrils reaching out. When it ensnares someone, this viscus goo starts to envelop them. Covering most of their orphisus as it sucks the fluid out of them, rendering them a withered husk after a period of time. Specifically, their mouth and nose are sealed for whatever reason. If broken free, there is a connection of sorts. Being able to hear it talk without it actually speaking. All I felt was dread. Not fear, not panic, but pure dread when I saw this. That was when I woke up at 5 this morning tired, but not wanting to go back to sleep. I really hate my disorders sometimes.

And I accidentally took it out on my siblings (9 and 3) I know it's not their fault that I'm forced to be their ""parent"". But I just couldn't help myself I yelled at them pretty much all day today. I apologized after I felt okay. But I still feel horrible for it. Today I also hurt myself again multiple times. I suffer from OCD and possibly PTSD me and my psychiatrist are still talking about that. It's gone to the point where it's a disability. So I was in kind of a weird state of mind all day.

Ok_Cartographer_4310,being high doesn’t fix the thoughts anymore ,2,1c5az6r,0,"i (17f) have been depressed for as long as I can remember. I grew up in an incredibly abusive household and I was born with drugs in my system (coke, alc, cigarettes, and smth else, but clearly i got issues because of it) and I have a lot of mental health issues because of those two factors. 

My anxiety, PTSD, and depression are probably my biggest struggles. 

I don’t sleep because sleeping means tomorrow is coming sooner rather than later. And so I stay up for days to delay it. I only leave to work and I have to force myself to get up to pee. 

All I ever do right now is lay in bed, get high, and use my phone to distract myself. I tend to watch movies or tv shows or tiktok because even reading is too much. 

At first, the weed helped I think. To be fair, I was only ever getting high with my friend at first. But now that I’m alone and in a bad despressive state, it feels like the weed makes it 10x worse. 

I struggle with PTSD (I haven’t been formally diagnosed with this but it makes the most sense.) and I get bad flashbacks from a lot of things I try so hard to forget. Sometimes I’ll smell the room and feel like I’m in it or I’ll remember the feelings and pain and I’ll have panic attacks or get really uncomfortable. And being high makes it worse. 

I usually can’t cry about my own issues and pain and I watch sad things to cope. But when I’m high it’s like all the thoughts I want to forget come rushing and I can’t hold it in. And all my other symptoms feel 10x worse. 

But I also use weed to cope with my home life because it feels better than being sober, and it feels like I can’t win. I also get less anxiety when high, so I feel like I can be my normal self around people.

Recently I was in a job where things didn't end well, my employer kept telling me that I wouldn't make it in any other place and that my performance was bad, which is weird because just a month before things ended, that same person told me that everyone was very satisfied with my performance. 

I know this might not be the normal question in here and that many people have harder problems, but for me this made me devastated. I've been suffering with self loathing since then and low self-esteem, my head keeps repeating what my employer said about me not able to make it elsewhere in the future, I feel like my whole self image has been deeply challenged because of this.

The adhd medication has changed my life. Its hard to work I need the money  because I  had a alchohol and cocaine problem with my ex girlfriend from 19-25 years old took out some loans for us i got fucked i have been sober other than eating weed edibles 30 mg a night  and broke up with her, she died 2 weeks later from a overdose and i carry this with me. This weekend I started drinking again because of what my sister did and I am drunk now, i just dont feel ok. I am planning to quit since i only have 3 beers left right now and I need to man up right now and not be a bitch. I went off topic with context but I sent my father to jail after my first place burnt down and came back home. My father never worked and my mother worked full time,  mostly in fast food. Anyway way I sent my father to jail because he tried to suffocate my mother either a pillow and I heard it, I got charged at first because I fought him, I kicked down the door screaming * hurt someone your own size i fucking dare you fucking hit me please (punching myself in the face)! Dont touch my fucking mother fuck you* after his streak of being non abusive and it was forgiven and he still thinks he is innocent and that I was brainwashed, well he went to jail and my charges were dropped after 9 court dates since he called the cops on me. After he did this  my mother told me he broke my ribs at 1 or 2 years old and they said I squirmed and fell out of his arms and that she was so heartbroken on how everytime I breathed she would hear them cracking that he knew he did it ( i have back pain every day from this and do a pysical job). I got mad and she said * hey I've gotten beat for you don't say I've done nothing* I started screaming at her blaming her for everything even though we were very close growing up, well I went homeless getting locked outside at- 20c with a thin Hoodie and her saying in tears that I am just like my father. I was a good fucking kid, I never laid a finger and used manners and tried to do anything so make someone smile and to be considerate.  I learned how not to cry because I would get beat more for it. It's been hard i cannot stop crying and i do not know how to show my emotions properly, i wont lash out on someone just because i feel bad but i hurt alot right now. I have a clean record for mental and criminal records other than a suicide attempt 11 years ago. My sister and father both her very dialated pupils, they go black. I have brown eyes and they both have blue but thier eyes go black. I don't get this. I want to get my nuts snipped because I don't want anyone to feel like this. It hurts alot.

Something that has been bothering me for a while is how little I trust my memory. About everything, basically. I often get the sense that I am lying when I tell people my name, my age, or other personal information. Or that I am filling out the wrong address on forms, or telling a story that never happened. I always tell myself to just push through it but I don't really have any way to prove it. I feel very guilty about it sometimes, because I need to check multiple time to make sure I am talking to the right person or that I remember who my girlfriend is or things like that, even if there really isn't a reason for me to question it in the first place. It's just always there.

I have gone to therapy before but not much happened. I struggle to be honest with my therapist and I feel like I am not telling the truth when I go, so I have not had any helpful advice from them and I stopped.

scaredycat07,Part of me doesn't want help.,3,1c57bmk,2,"I'm (26F) fairly certain that I have mental health issues, and am worried that it's a lot. It's affecting my life. My emotions are all over the place and mostly negative, I have no friends, I'm not able to trust anyone, I don't have much motivation to do anything, and it always feels like something bad is about to happen. I've been this way for years now.

Despite knowing that I probably need help, part of me doesn't want help. I realized this when I tried taking an SSRI (due to sleep issues, my doctor said I have anxiety.).

Since I was about a pre-teen, I noticed that I can experience intense emotions when engaging in certain types of media and darker themes. I find these pieces of media to be validating, cathartic, and a way for me to explore things in a safe way. But, when I took the SSRI, these feelings completely disappeared, and I couldn't enjoy those things anymore. My darker thoughts disappeared too. It felt like I lost myself, and I was super uncomfortable with it. I hated it.

I'm no longer taking the meds (due to other side effects), and the feelings and thoughts returned.

I'm just afraid that if I seek help, I won't be able to enjoy those things anymore, and that I'll lose my sense of self. I know it sounds silly, but, it's really stopping me from seeking help.

As I write this I feel sick to my stomach, I've woken up for the past few days filled with anxiety. My hands feel shakey, fingers feel fuzzy, I want to cry all the time, my chest feels sick and tight, I feel like I can't breath properly. Last night I just cried and hyperventilated. 

And all becsuse i feel like my life is wasted. I dont have any friends, I only have my partner. Ive been thinking a lot these past few days and due to have zero friends it's making me miss out a lot on life. I don't have anyone to call, text, catch up with, celebrate birthdays or life events with, I'll never have and never attend a bachelor/ bachelorette parties, i wont have a typical nice weddings filled with people i love (because i dont have any), I'll never be a bridesmaid, I won't have anyone at my funeral, I'll be an old lady that dies and no one know what to do with cos she doesnt have any family or friends. I'll never do normal typical things or hit normal milestones. I cant act normal, I can't speak to people normally, I cant function normally. 

It's really sad to see everyone else do these things and realise that I'll never have that. Im reducing my social media time because its painful to see people out having fun with friends and how life could be and the experiences I'm missing out on. 

It makes me really upset and hurt that I'll miss out on these things. I don't see the point in my absolute waste of a life. If I wasn't here today, no one and nothing would be impacted. I've wasted my life trying to survive and now I'm paying the consequences as a lonely, sad, depressed, mentally ill person in my 30s. 

I absolutely fucking hate the people who treated me life shit as a child because its their fucking fault i can't function as a normal member of society. It's their fault I have to deal with being a mental fuck up and cant regulate my emotions, it's their fault I cant connected with people and let them in. It's their fault I panic in notmal scenarios. 

What I would give to wake up tomorrow and feel loved by people and act normal.

Also I don't know if im sad and depressed as to why I'm feeling so panicked/ anxious about this. Because in reality, do I even want those things? Or does my mental health stop me from wanting these things. Is it something I want or something I think I want because everyone else has it. Without my issues, would I want these ""normal"" events? Without my mental health would my life be different or am i just sad, lonely and craving love? Who even knows?

I did this last time nothing happened but this time cold turkey was so scary. Anyways I’m depressed I have adhd and anxiety. Oh and I guess a mood disorder. I’ve been anxious since I can remember. At 36 had my son with my high school sweetheart. Married in 2020. Bought our home, we both live remote and have good jobs. Raising our little guy. I have it all really. But after 2021 my mental health has gone down hill. Postpartum hit hard, I found out my brother who is 2 years younger than me sexually abused my niece. Mom and dad stood with him. I stood with my sister but it’s always just felt like this hit me so hard like she still kept contact with the them. I cut everyone off. My mom and I used to be so close. We are getting better. My dad won’t leave me alone. He wants me in his life but this has triggered flash backs and I think I was abused as a kid. Honestly idk I always blacked it out but now it’s starting to make sense. I woke up from my bunkbed eyes just adjusting when I realized my underwear around my ankles. I turn to quickly see his black Curley hair turn away fast I know I saw his eyes and then it goes blurry. When my Dads dad died my sister told me she had woken up with her underwear off and they were the only ones in the house. She said this to me at the same time we found out what my brother did. It’s kinda feels like a confirmation as to what I think and tried to forget happened. Honestly I don’t even know anymore… I also remember laying underneath my bunk bed eyes closed imagining or dreaming I was on a table and people were touching me?? This was when I was little I always have had those flashbacks in the back of my head but I always assumed it must have not been real maybe I dreamt it? I must have been like 5 or 6? Not sure but since my sister told me what she experienced I can’t help but think something happened. My dad has always been weirdly attached to me more than allll his kids. If always hear about how my dad went crazy over me when I was born. He didn’t love my sister because they had lost their bond when my dad came to the states and my mom stayed back in El Salvador with my sister then came to the states and by that time my sister had forgotten my dad and she only wanted my moms dad. I’m assuming that angered him idk but she was beat by him and I was treated like a princess. I was born here in the USA. Now all these memories are coming together like something not so pleasant since finding out my brother is a pedo and my parents protected him. Even to some point my sister felt bad for him. 
It’s 2024 now everyone’s kinda moved on seems like, family dynamics have changed but I am here still stuck in grief. 

I went back on meds just to feel nothing
And weed became an addiction for me 

I’ve always been the “responsible” one or whatever feels like I’m a golden child.

I hate myself

I always have and it grew when I turned 13. I’ll be 30 in November and for the first time ever I really do feel suicidal. I’m not just emo anymore.

I quit my meds and seriously went into withdrawal. I’m better now but with just 50 of 
Zoloft and I just feel like they never even helped and alll the hurt I’ve ignored is knocking at my door and each panic attack gets scarier and I become more dissociative. I want to be alive for my son but now death just seems so inviting, the guild of what that would do to him is the only thing keeping me grounded. I really don’t want to be on meds.

I’m embarrassed to say this but it prevents me from doing many normal daily tasks. I brush my teeth once every few days, only shower once every 1-2 weeks, cannot cook food for myself, if food is cooked for me I often don’t even have the energy to eat it, when I need to go to the toilet I will sit for hours until I actually go, leaving me incredibly uncomfortable, I don’t go out and socialise with friends, at times I can’t even dress myself and my boyfriend has to help me, and I am very tired and negative all the time. I suffer with SH and due to my eating habits I am underweight. I will admit that I have thought about suicide on and off for many years, making detailed plans on a number of occassions, although my uncle killed himself and the guilt of making my dad go through that again is too much. I am also afraid that it wouldn’t work and people were disappointed in me or I ended up physically disabled. I’m being open in the hopes that it will help other people not feel so misunderstood and alone, and so that others in my situation can use this post to help themselves.
I have switched around medications, all of which seem to provide minimal help, I’ve had therapy (of different sorts) and been to A&E when things have gotten too bad. 

I am 17, in the UK,  and dropped out of college during my second year. Originally I planned to go back, to retry the next year, but as the time is getting closer I am realising that I don’t think I will be capable of it. I want to be able to make my own income and be independent, but as of right now being in college just won’t work for me. People have said that I should believe in myself, but in school, and college, I did this and it has never worked out for me. I know myself better than anyone else does, and if I’m being realistic I know that it just isn’t for me. 

I live alone with my mum, and she will be supportive of any decisions I make. As of right now I need advice or possible options for me in the future.

Maybe jobs, ways I can work my way through life, ways of income, education etc. Any advice would be brilliant as I am at a loss right now. I feel like there are no routes I can go down, and my future is feeling very nonexistent. I find that I am very bad with repitition, if I do something the same time every month it begins to become very difficult and I cannot gather motivation to do it. Though I feel like almost all jobs will be repetitive.

Even though I was given up to a family that tried to their best with me even there I didn't feel as wanted as my ""brother and sisters"" now anytime someone shows any interest into me for over a week or so and I become attached immediately I know it's not good and I can't stop it no matter what I do it will happen and it always goes one of two ways eather they dont wana put up with me and leave(the way I hope it goes) or (the way that really hurts) they say nothing that I d9 will bother them they arnt gonna leave and they last like a month before they ghost me and I never talk to then again This has been happening so consistently in my life.

It was just two days in of him being sick and some other things happened too. Then ofc i wasn't okay with it as I love him more than anything. It's like that he filled up the hollowness in me with his love and suddenly left me empty. We both know that space or break don't end well so I asked him if he wants to end it. He at last meant yes he wanted to break up. This has hurt me so much, it has affected me so much that i really feel like ending everything because I have no one except him, literally no one.

But what else does NoFap do? Does it boost testosterone? Does it make me more confident? Will I be able to talk with my crush easier? ",1713252949.0,
Kat_Hglt,Still a monster wuthout my meds?,1,1c5a8iv,1,"I don't know where to even begin...  
I was always a very nervous, irritated child, I used to throw a lot of tantrums when overstimulated, which I very easily was. Teenage years were hell as well, I was so nervous all the time, had no social cues, stressed a lot about EVERYTHING. I destroyed my room several times due to not being able to regulate my emotions, I was insulting towards my parents, I was depressed, had no friends. We thought it was depression. I tried several meds, it didn't help. Then, at 18, I tried escitalopram. It got better. It was not immediately perfect, but it got waaaaay more manageable. I was more relaxed, happier, I even became more agreeable to be around.

I'm now 29, and for the last 11 years, it kept improving. I have a stable job, a stable boyfriend, we rent a quite small yet relatively cosy apartment. I have few but good friends and I have a good relationship with my family. I discovered I can actually be a joyful, easy going and fun person. Life is good.

Now, my ""problem"" is: my psychiatrist told me when I started to take escitalopram that I might need to take it for my whole life. At the time, I didn't really care, because my life was HELL, so I thought ""whatever it takes"". But now, I'm starting to question myself. I tried to decrease the dosage (with my psychiatrist's approval, of course), but I can't seem to function under 10mg.

And now I'm starting doubting myself: I thought I had progressed so much in life, I had learned how to manage my anxiety and my emotions better, in short, I thought I had finally become a BETTER PERSON, A GOOD PERSON, which I never thought I was before. But as soon as the dosage drops below 10mg, I become a literal monster. I become aggressive again, a nervous wreck, I want to cry and sleep all day, I snap at people for the pettiest reason ever. And I KNOW my psychiatrist told me I might need to take the medication for ever, but I can't help thinking I'm actually not the joyful, easy going and fun person I thought I had become. I have actually made no progress AT ALL. It's the medication that does that. I'm actually still bad. And that thought breaks me...",1713252948.0,

Does anybody have any advice for jumpstarting myself lmao to at least try. 

Edit: thank you for the advice and concern. I have been seeing the same therapist for over 4 years and he really helped in the beginning but I’m thinking it might be time to part ways. I feel as if sometimes he gives me almost a “free pass” for certain behaviour, because of previous experiences and trauma but I want to be held accountable. Yes there are reasons but it’s not an excuse. 

I have been offered so many wonderful opportunities and it is killing me that I am so down all the time I’m not even appreciating and making the most of what I do have.

TheGreaterShade,My Old Professor Embarrassed Me,3,1c5398x,3,"I, f26, have been struggling to get through community college for a while. I am kinda embarrassed to admit I started in 2016. I was out of high school and had no idea how to tackle college. I was a TERRIBLE student who took way too many classes, couldn't handle the workload, fell in with some terrible people, and developed horrible habits as a result. I frequently skipped classes, couldn't turn anything in on time, was constantly obessing over things that weren't important, and had no organizational or management strategies in place to help me. Ultimately, I ended up burning myself out, plowing my GPA into the ground, losing my financial aid, and spending several years telling myself I was a worthless failure. 

There were also external factors that didn't help. I worked as hard as I could for several years to save up to go back, and then Covid happened, which delayed things. Then my boss basically moved the heavens and Earth to ensure I wouldn't go back to college.

But I clawed my way back, I payed for a few semesters out of pocket, I took a new job to accommodate my schooling, I got in with a wonderful therapist who's helped me get back on track and stay that way. I'm happy to report that I'm doing so much better, but something happened the other day that doesn't sit so well with me.

One of my previous professors, the head of the English department no less, stopped me in the hall on my way to class.

""I know you from somewhere, I just can't remember where."" She said.

I told her how I was in one of her classes in 2016. It was enough to jog her memory. 

She then said, ""Wow, you've been here forever. Are you gonna graduate?""

Normally, I brush this off as her being an old nosy woman and me being sensitive. But I can shake her words because they felt a bullet to chest. It is safe to say that interaction messed up my entire day and has led me to ruminate. 

It's 2024 now, I've spent a decade trying to reconcile my younger self's mistakes. I have spent so long chasing an associates in arts and sciences, the easiest darn degree in existence as far as everyone around me in concerned, and despite the odds I have fought, and obstacle I've had to overcome, its doesn't feel like enough. 

Meanwhile, my friends and family have moved on with their lives. Everyone I know around me is miles ahead - getting bachelors, getting better jobs, getting married, buying houses, having children - and here I am unable to figure out how to exist the gate. It leaves me feeling slow, stupid, and stunted. I feel like I will never amount to anything because I am a factory mistake, forever and eternally flawed with no hope of being anything else. 

So, this one interaction continues to haunt me, and I'm not so certain how to deal with it. ",1713229591.0,
AshesInTheDust,"If I'm not inherently an unlikeable and bad person, why was/am I hated so much?",1,1c59odt,0,"Now that I'm older, when I open up to people about wanting to kill myself or feeling that I deserve to die they tell me that I shouldn't. Reasonable I suppose. But they also tell me that they actually enjoy my presence. That they aren't around just because I'm convenient or better than nothing. That they miss me when I'm not around. Less reasonable. I can't believe what they say is true. I think they're lying out of guilt, they just want to feel important, they don't want to feel responsible for any harm I'd do to myself, or that they're just being polite.
  
Ik it's because I've internalized that I'm an inherently terrible person. It's why, even if I'm not actively suicidal, I still believe that I deserve to die. This isn't paranoia or me projecting self hatred either. My entire childhood was just full of insults, osterization, neglect, or indifference at best.
  
Originally I was going to include examples but I've decided against it, feel free to ask trauma dumping is a hobby of mine at this point.
  
I understand that a child realistically can't be deserving of that. I understand that even if I somehow did I am not responsible for it. I think I've been punished enough for any potential sin at this point. I understand that I've literally never done anything to warrant this treatment. I think the worse thing I've ever done was maybe being a rude? I used to steal classmates pencils too. I also flipped off a friend behind their back when I was in the 3rd grade for some reason. I still don't know why I did that actually. What I'm saying is that realistically I don't deserve a shitton of hatred.
  
But I can't believe that my life is worth living. I can't believe that I'm anything other than a useless failure who will inevitably hurt everyone around me by being around them. I can't believe I'm anything other than an annoying insufferable peice of shit that should have never been born. I can't believe that. I just can't.
  
Because if I am a somewhat decent human being. Hell, if I could be considered a human being at all, then why did people treat me like that? So many people, for so long, if I didn't do anything to deserve it why the hell did that happen? Why, in the case of my parents, is it still happening? If I don't deserve this how I am supposed to be able to remotely deal with that? Frankly, it's easier to just accept it and kill myself. ""I'm a horrible person who deserves to die, so I will die"". It's easier. 
  
Also, if the nice things people say is true, where the fuck where these people? How did I not meet a single kind person for the first 18 years of my life. I had friends, but they always purposely hurt me at the end. Fuck I had one literally tell me that they always hated me, but they needed someone to take the majority of the bullying. That's not really an uncommon occurrence for me. I never had a single teacher, stranger, friend, or family member actually help me, listen to me, do anything. It can't be bad luck I refuse to believe it was bad luck it has to be something I was and maybe still am doing I have to be the problem here. It would make sense if I am just a bad person, because then it would be that I didn't deserve their kindness. That makes more sense, that's so much more realistic than bad luck.
  
So why the hell, with everything in mind, how or why or I don't know if I should live why was I hated so much? If I genuinely didn't deserve it, if I currently don't deserve it, then why was or is it happening?",1713250695.0,

I was stressful person always  ,but with my therapist  I managed to fix  a lot in one year and I am continuing in order  to find  a balance. 

My problem is that the line of therapy success  is up but my health  or mental health  is decreasing  (by my view)
For 10 days I am  having tingling  sensation  or tenderness  on my left hand I feel dizzy, nausea,acid reflux, feel of doom or something  bad is about to happen  to me. 
I went on every doctor ,I ve done every blood test and they were always  saying  ""man your blood test is very good "" or "" it's on your mind  you  are very healthy you have nothing to worry about  just manage  your stress "" (I am 24 years old male)
I went for gastroscopy last year  before I start  psychotherapy  because the pain i was feeling  on my stomach  was super bad . I couldn't  eat because  everytime  I was eating the feeling  of like lava upper left  would skyrocket.
Guess what  ? Nothing... 

You know what's unlucky ? before my symptoms start I was feeling  super ok and happy  and I just asked myself  ""hmmm my day is good and I am super happy there is no way this feeling  will last that's very sus"" and boom in one hour after I said that boom

FriendlyFraulein,I feel so boring compared to my friend,1,1c59i2c,2,"I’m 36 years old. When I compare myself to my friends and all the fun things they are posting about on SM and telling me what they are doing, I feel so boring and dull.

I feel like all I do is work, run errands and lay around, and maybe see a friend once a week.

One of my friends in particular just moved to the city I’m in, and I find myself often feeling jealous of her because she’s posting how she’s doing like three things a day, and partying often etc.

But when I think about that, I did that stuff more often when I was first in the city, and if I was invited to all those things I probably wouldn’t want to go. In fact when I think about being my happiest it’s when I’m doing craft or getting a nice coffee with a friend, or travelling. Not doing lots of group things.

So maybe I’m just more introverted than other people and that’s okay? Or maybe my work means more to me than others and that’s okay? I have many hobbies but I haven’t done them in a long time but they are all inside activities when I feel like I should be outside.

I’m also doing NO exercise, and they all exercise a lot.

1. I’m pissed at myself for not being single for a long time. I’ve always been a relationship girly and this stems from the fact that I like sex way too much to be hopping from partner to partner. Plus I just really value human connection and I love how deep it feels overtime, but if I’m honest, I probably would have benefited so much from being single. Getting my routine down and self love up and then getting a partner. 
2. I have few friends. I guess that’s life but it’s like I lost my HS friends when I had to choose between my sister or them. Then went to college. Made a gay best friend , he’s male and still very much a Ho lol no shade but I’m like damn near married. No genuine/deep friendships made in law school, it’s very cut throat. Now adult life and everyone seems to be touch and go. 
3. Professionally, I’m so fucking tired of being a woman in this field. The paralegals don’t really respect baby attorneys and your colleagues are just colleagues. Every time I speak it’s like they think I should shut up or they’re intimidated . Meanwhile, if you’re a dude, women treat them like “how may I suck your dick? Anything I can do for you” and amongst guys it’s like ,”let’s not make this guys job harder”
4. I’m tired of being part of the male gaze. The legal field is progressing but in general , people think lawyers should look and talk and act a certain way. Picture Zendaya but a lawyer. Who’s done the work, incredibly smart and capable but not getting recognized in the way she wants to be. Not that I’m on zendayas level but just to conceptualize it for y’all.

DoggoTamer27,"I get overly sentimental and sad when a vacation ends, especially any time I go to Alaska. ",2,1c58q51,1,"I travel quite a bit, mainly to see family and overall be closer together, but even when I’m not, even when I’m simply just going on a vacation, big or small, roadtrip to a neighboring state or flying across a whole continent, I always get incredibly depressed, sad, and have extreme FOMO of everything around me. 

Recently I am getting done with a two week trip from Alaska. It has been great to see all of my friends and family, and I will be coming up in another month anyway (this however for work purposes, I work commercial fishing in the summer). Which makes me wonder why I’m so sad. I can’t do anything without feeling the anxiety of missing out on something. I get almost scared and anxious when I’m in a room without windows. I need to constantly see outside because I feel like I will miss something, or I at least want to “see the sights for the last time” even though I’m not leaving until tomorrow afternoon. I’ll be absolutely miserable and depressed at the fact that I’m leaving and have to verbally talk to myself on why it’s not a bad thing and how everything will work out fine and be ok and that I’ll be back in a month anyway. I’ll find myself staring out a window just at the scenery, not even good scenery literally just a back alley away as I’m staying with a friend in Anchorage for a few nights before I fully leave. But for some reason I still can’t pull myself away from the window, and I still just keep wanting to see the sky, see everything and say “farewell” if you will I guess. But even when I walk away and go somewhere throughout the house I get incredibly anxious. I find myself constantly looking at friends snap map locations in my home town (not in a weird way and only certain friends, the ones in particular I’ve known for over 13 years) because I simply have such bad FOMO and still want to be with them and I feel like checking snap map and keeping in contact is a way I can still somewhat be there. 

I’ve broken down multiple times even since leaving my home town and traveling to Anchorage. Thinking about just how much my friends and even their own families have told me how much they care for me, for some reason makes me incredibly emotional and I feel the opposite of what I should feel, I just feel sad, and cry, especially after one of my buddies moms sent me a text about how much I meant to her and their family, and that she viewed me as a second son. 

I don’t get why I’m feeling so sad about leaving, I get this way with any trip I take, but even in the past of leaving Alaska, and saying goodbye sometimes for even much longer periods of time, it has never felt this bad and saddening.

I suck at my job, I suck at my hobbies, and I can’t even bring myself to do them or even care about them anymore.

I (19M) have been struggling a lot over the past 4 years, for various reasons. Over time, I fell into a really deep depression, with no help. I often find myself filled with anger, usually when something goes wrong, or something doesn't go the way I wanted it to. As of very recently I've resorted to punching a wall, or myself, which is something I really don't want to turn into a habit. I also scream into a pillow occasionally. A therapist I saw a while ago said it could help release anger, it doesn't, it just distracts me. Therapy as a whole hasn't helped me at all, I don't know if it was me or the therapists I went to. I kind of feel hopeless right now, I'm filled with all these emotions and don't know what to do, and I have no one I trust enough to share this with. I've tried breathing exercises, screaming into a pillow, 1-2 types of meditation, and it doesn't help. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to try and fix this? Thank you",1713246881.0,

Latter-Blacksmith652,I don’t even know what’s wrong with me anymore ,1,1c5831x,1,"I used to have what was very obviously depression and anxiety. Went on sertraline and bupropion for about 6 months and have been tapering for the past month (per my doctor’s instructions). I decided to taper because even after adjustments to my dosage and the addition of bupropion i was so numb. Also, the tinnitus was really bad. My school performance was suffering I think because i didn’t have the anxiety that would normally drive me to get stuff done.

 It’s been a week of being completely off my medication and I’m able to cry again (which is a good thing for me) but I don’t feel any better otherwise. The brain zaps are terrible first of all- they’re making me feel super out of it. Secondly (and this is probably my biggest issue), I can’t get myself to go to class/get caught up on school work. I’ve only gone to a few classes in the last month and a half and I’m really digging myself into a hole. The problem is.. I just don’t care? I feel nothing about the F I have in every class. Intellectually I know I need to just suck it up and go but it’s like there’s an even more powerful force in my brain trying to sabotage me. Idk if that makes sense. 

I suppose it’s a sensation of not feeling real? Like the consequences of what I’m doing don’t scare me whatsoever. I don’t know how to break out of this. Part of me feels like I don’t even want to break out of it.

Aggressive-Wrap6748,Can you help me figure this out?,1,1c57rfi,0,"I feel like I can’t talk to a guy I like because I know it can’t be forever 
It’s sucking the air from my lungs 
It’s gonna kill me to make him feel bad when I tell him no 
That he can’t love me and I won’t love him 

I’m not sure if he even wants a relationship…
We have chemistry of a sort and we both have mental health issues…

Context: I worked with him for like 5 or 6 months… I went to his house once…

I won’t commit to him 
I feel very threatened by him 
Anytime I talk to him I get physically ill with many symptoms 
The stress makes me want to run 

I used to feel practically haunted by him in my head when my anxiety was so bad 
I felt almost as if demonically possessed after talking to him, that’s how bad the fear was 
I always thought maybe I’m sensing something real and that maybe it is a danger to be with him 

I know of one thing he’s done that was pretty bad in the past, but doesn’t everyone do bad things at some point in their life? His was involving another person but part of me thinks he’d feel pretty bad about it… I’d hope..


Anyway, I’ve done this so many times in my life with men.. I basically feel some sort of sense of being desired by them and it’s exhilarating.. it’s so lovely but it’s also something that fills me with so much fear that I can’t really rationally figure out what the situation actually is. It actually feels more like a trap and I end up hating him for wanting me… idk in what way he might want me but like with all men I’d assume sexually.. but also maybe just maybe in a true and loving way? Part of me thinks deep down he has extreme anger issues and maybe even hates women and would love to beat them… honestly I can’t tell if that’s just my weird suspicious and fearful side making things up or if I have an intuition.. I guess by some of the things he likes: movies/music it makes me suspicious of him cause it’s so violent… but literally I also listen to violent music—- the $uicideboy$… 

I don’t even know what I want to do with my life, but part of me wants to end up moving to a different country (MAYBE) so that’s why I broke it off with the other guys too..

Is it okay to just talk to a guy in a somewhat platonic way and assume they’re not falling in love with me? There’s these voices in my head that fault me for leading him on and giving any love to him if I don’t love him in every capacity…

I told him happy birthday and sent him a platonic yet kind and thoughtful text message. Now he’s texting me and I think he wants me to come to his house… nothing wrong with it necessarily..
But feelings of fear come up because I start feeling like idk if I trust him… and I feel trapped and in fear at the thought of being his friend.. I feel like that with some people… not just him… but also, part of me feels like I can be totally my real self with him… 

I think I feel like I’m gonna lose him if I can’t give all of myself to him


Is it just a trauma bond? 
Like maybe there’s no real basis for having a friendship but we are there for each other as emotional support and validation?
What’s happening? 
Am I extremely paranoid for no reason? 
It seriously feels like my whole world is crashing down every time I talk to him in a way where there’s potential for the relationship going further… 

I definitely have issues with black/white thinking… I’ve also violated my intuition and needs a lot in life so I can’t tell what’s real and not.. I feel very fond of this guy even with the other side of me feeling the exact opposite.
It’s just so angering. 
It makes me feel sick to have to be his friend but I also want to???

I don’t even really know who I am or what I want in life because I’ve spent so long pleasing everyone but myself.. part of being with him would be a way of pleasing myself.. but at the same time I have a lot of fear around some things about him that just aren’t gonna guarantee a safe future in some aspects (freedom to live wherever I want, the fact that I can’t control how he treats himself, I can’t control his family, etc.).

Feelings are very very confused and back and forth and violently tumultuous.

I watched my Mom have to endure the brunt of this as I tried to mitigate trying to find a job, bring in severe debt, and being at rock bottom emotionally. We both had to watch as my Dad chose to abandon us emotionally and fiscally as we tried to take care of Grandma in the nursing home.

This relationship I can honestly say I didn’t want to end but felt pressured to do so from fatigue after several poorly executed intimate moments between New years and Valentine’s Day that year. They were non-sexual, just poorly handled on my part. In turn the shame caused me to feel it was necessary to break up with her. 
I have tried to contact her twice to apologize and see if some kind of a relationship could be salvaged, and have been met with vicious retort as she held nothing but anger towards me.

In 2022 I was kicked out for a band I was playing bass in after 6 months due to an argument between the lead singer, lead guitarist and I. The argument was about a parking spot, but it was so much more for me. It was the lack of consideration, the passive aggressive insults, and the overall peon treatment that I had endured.

With all this on my conscious, how can I feel the desire to interact with the world again?
What tools are there that I can use to feel the desire to talk to women again?
Even the effort of driving to work puts panic in me.

In a moment of desperation, I even reached out to his mom (who doesn't even know me), which I regret. We tried to reconcile, but he expressed that he found me too needy and co-dependent, and ultimately, he ended things, citing his own personal issues and the need for space. I was deeply invested in this relationship, especially since I lost my virginity to him. This was all in a span of one month, and I truly liked him and wanted to be with him for the long term. I'm strongly mourning what could've been. I feel like this is all my fault.   
I just want to call him and text him to work things out, but I know it would do more harm than good if I did that right now.

Responsible-Buy7550,Can someone help me explain what's going on?,1,1c541sg,2,"Hello all!

I (male) have a complicated relationship with my mother. She had me when she was 15 years old, getting pregnant by my seemingly antisocial father from what I gather.

Despite the trauma, and I imagine an internal conflict about how she really felt about having me, she does some really strange things in my opinion...

Firstly, it's how she's been treating me since I was little - (threaten to) abandoning me at the slightest hint of any flaw I might have as a human - whether physically or emotionally.

Secondly, she often mirrors how I feel about things and she makes it seem like it's how she feels about things, but I can tell it's not what she really feels about it. Hard to explain, but an example - if I feel helpless, she feels helpless - and that's not just for the moment, which I would more easily understand - mirroring - but it might be to how I feel in life in general...

Then, I feel personally responsible to comfort her, and I'm beginning to question if this is all an act on her part. And if so, I don't know if it's conscious or not.

She does mirror people in general and is deeply insecure about herself as well as rejecting it as a whole. But this ""life-mirroring"" and discard is something she does specifically towards me...

I'm not looking to diagnose her, but some pointing out how I should understand it all, would probably be of good help. Any advice would also be appreciated, but try to keep in mind that I'm getting old and don't have that many relationships in my life. I would go to therapy, if it was affordable for me at the moment...

(I don't want the latest jungle telegraph advice - but something from someone who genuinely understands what I'm talking about)

cantthinkofone47,Looking for hope,1,1c53vdv,3,"Hi. This is my first post here. I, 28F, have been given a long list of diagnoses over the last 20 years. I struggled severely with anxiety from the time I was a toddler. From there, I went through countless emotional traumas as well as physical/medical traumas of all kinds from the ages of 5-22, many with permanent impacts for the rest of my life. I have been seeing psychiatrists and psychotherapists for over 10 years, and I’ve tried damn near everything. Went through all the SSRI’s , moved on to SNRI’s which are no longer responding. Spent years on heavy doses of klonopin which helped the anxiety, panic attacks, constant rumination, etc however I became highly dependent and didn’t want to remain on benzos long term. I did okay after coming off of them, but a few years ago things started getting worse and worse for me. My symptoms are debilitating. Crying spells, panic attacks, thoughts of death, wishing I didn’t exist. I’m so insanely sensitive to anything people say or do near me or towards me. I find the worst in every scenario. This last year, I overhauled my mental health team for better (and more expensive) treatment, including a total overhead of all medications and a third  orthopedic surgery to help with physical pain. I had to go back to the surgeon today, and it looks like I’ll be needing a fourth with no end in sight, all because some idiot hit me with their car. And some days I do feel like I’m making improvements, until one small comment someone may make or some difficult news at a doctor appointment and I completely regress. I feel hopeless. I used to be a straight A student, an athlete, a friend, a family member, and I feel like all I am not is a shell of a person. I can barely keep my work from home job.

I did it for selfish reasons, I kept getting nightmares of what she did and it made me want to end myself, got to a point where I wouldn't hide the bruises anymore just to see if anyone would notice, they did only twice and when they asked what happened I just shrugged. Again, I feel so bad for everything I did, I took it all back, I said I lied, my mum said I lied, so did my dad and brothers, so it truly looks like I'm a liar, I don't like that of course, but it's for the best. **Thing is I didn't just go out spouting that shit, she asked, she asked what was wrong because I was upset, she asked.**

What I hate though, is my mum told people I liked Hitler, she said I loved how he manipulated people and that he was my idol. That was never true.

  
I understand that I'm a manipulative narcissist, but I don't know how to stop. At the hospital according to my dad a nurse told him she could 'see evil in me' I'm not sure what I did to have that said, and my mum told me in the hospital, the nurses said, 'she's pushing buttons isn't she?' when they saw that on my records it says I claim she hit me? Something like that. (Again I took it all back so I don't know why that's there)

Adderall used to work when I was younger. It doesn't anymore.

In general without medication I feel so hungry and tired all the time. With medication it makes it worse.  I can't get regular sleep without continuously waking up everyday. I've been feeling so hungry over the past few years. When i complain they test me and my labs come back normal so they just shrug. I'm sorry tried of living. Everyday is so miserable. 

Without my meds I lose everything, get mad, I can't function, I can barely take care of myself. With my meds I feel sick and miserable too.
  I am on duloxetine because it's the only med that doesn't apparently cause weight gain. It kind of works. 

I gained a bunch of weight after starting the depo shot a few years ago because my cramps were debilitating and i would throw up and be unable to walk, and my period is very heavy so i tried to opt out of that experience. 50 pounds later i hate myself so much and i still feel so hungry every day. I have switched to using patches continuously to skip my period but the best part is when i take my adderall i start BREAKTHROUGH BLEEDING and severely cramping. how am i supposed to win???? 

Then the stupid ass doctors just tell me to take ibuprofen, which i can't because it doesn't work as well anymore, and it interacts with duloxetine and Tylenol is just about as useful as my PINKY TOE.


 I've tried so many diets, calorie counting, drinking water, i wake up in the middle of the night hungry. I could eat until I'm so full i can't move but i would STILL BE HUNGRY. Doctors don't know what's wrong with me and don't know why my adderall doesn't work. My A1C and glucose is perfect.

It's gotten to the point where I pretty regularly cry about being hungry no matter how little or how much i eat, and I'm even STARVING ON ADDERALL.

I have been trying so many different doses of fucking every stimulant And i would literally go home from school and work crying and i have been crying in the bathrooms lately. I want my body back and my life and my money i spend it all on food and I struggle in school and work and i just want to function like a normal person.

Recently my brains been acting up and i swear something keeps touching me and i hear little noises like doors opening and phones/alarms goingn off wuen im stressed out. When ingo for a walk i get disoriented too and hear little clicks and noises in the bushes. I’m spiritual too and i have to debate with mysef whether im losing my mind of over small things or if its part of the process (it has been a few times but still.) It’s getting to the point where i cant read with how fuzzy my brain is because itbwill just refuse to take in any new informtatuon at a fertainnpoint and goes blank. Im a very weird and high energy person which i came to terms with but a lot of people just think im stupid and that just pisses me off lmao. I play bass but there is a small problem with it because i care sonmuch about this dumb instrument that it can send me into a week long slump of feeling like absolute shit if i have a bad rehersal and instill dont even have a real band out side of a program. I try to talk to people (who ar okay with it) in myblittle friend group about how i feel like im slipping away but they always think im just kidding ig. I dont have a good relationship with my parents because i realize they’re genuinely toxic assholes with the rest of the family who hate everyone who isnt straight white and male. They also think mental health is a joke and my mom literally found and took blades despite seeing scratches all over me when i was at my worse point and just brushes it off when i said it was the dog. She also got me bandaids because i “use so many!” Which is kind of hilarious in its own way. I made a asuicide joke at school and the teacher called home but both my parents were more concerned about getting another call from thte school than checkingh on me (they said they’d ground me if they got one more calll.). I desperately want to escape realiry and just gove myself a break but no amount of time has ever been enough for me to actually recharge regardless of a vacation, holiday, trip, anything isnt enough. 

Recent update, my friend’s been doing worse about the whole sh thing and now does it infront of me in class as a ‘joke’ so that’s sugoi meanwhile im breaking down over not practicing as well as i should on the bass ",1713227541.0,
askingforarefill,Upset with life atm,1,1c52g0r,2,"- getting rejected today made me feel violent thoughts unfortunately, and me think like a really bitter, and horrible person. Thankfully I Bebe actually show these much, apart from the most I said in terms of venting my fustration was “yup, she’ll probably go home to her abusive boy freind and get beaten up”. As a way of me venting my fustration through a joke.

- getting made fun of for running my own fitness account on TikTok. Ik, it sounds insane considering that’s a good way to become successful and I’m in a fitness college course.

- my college teacher being an annoying twat, making his awful jokes only to boost his own ego, thinking he’s the best man in the room. I’ve been called sensitive once on Reddit and I’m worried I am, but I can’t help but just get pissed off at that man.

- I also feel really, really inferior to my peers, and have done for years. My parents keep telling me to look forward but I can’t. I’m sorry, I have no hope for the future.

- “why’s it’s me that’s ridiculed” “why am I socially awkward” “why can’t I have a fucking girlfriend like the cunts in social media” “why did I have to lock myself in the toilet at break time, and sit in my own” are all thoughts that passed though me today and wrote down on a pad.

Idk what to do. I feel like I’m just a loser, who will get no where and constantly be miserable. That’s how I feel when I talk to my dad about it.

JakeThompson25,Stress is brining out weird mental issues? ,1,1c529o3,5,"I am a junior in college, and as you could imagine the past couple years have been pretty stressful ones, but this current semester is especially rough. I’ve been having a lot of stress and have also struggled with sleeping enough. I think these things are leading to weird mental stress, and it’s causing me to have tons of guilt/anxiety/self hate about thoughts (key thing here is thoughts, not actions) I had when I was in the first half of my teens. I won’t go into what exactly these thoughts were, but there were just a few, with each probably occurring no more than twice. they were all very sexual things that would not be considered ok by most (that includes myself) no obsession/fixation ever occurred with these thoughts and I never had the slightest urge to make them anything besides a thought. This phase of hyper sexual thoughts (a majority of which were perfectly normal) lasted if I had to guess from 14-16 (now 21.) Since then to now I’ve been totally normal with no regard to those very few disturbing thoughts. I lead a normal life and have a very healthy relationship and sex life. I’m so confused why years later bad thoughts I had as a teen are coming back and wreaking havoc on my brain?! I have a pretty good memory but I still find it super bizarre that this has surfaced, aside from the moment I had those thoughts they never crossed my mind again until now. I find it revolting and shameful, I feel like I am not a good person and I’m just as bad as a criminal. How can thoughts from years ago make me feel like I actually did something really bad? I am still going through my day without being entirely miserable, but it’s getting more and more difficult to write off these feeling that I’ve described. 
What is happening? Am I as horrible as my brain is telling me I am? Any feedback is appreciated.

Level5552,Working my way out of Functional Freeze mode…,1,1c51zom,0,"Hi. This is not easy for me to be here, even from behind a screen and with my identity protected. Asking for help has never been my thing but I feel that I have few other options. While doom scrolling TT the other night, I came across a post that gave me the clarity I’ve been seeking for years…I have been stuck in Functional Freeze mode for most of my adult life and I only seem to be numbing more and more since coming to this conclusion. I have been on a healing journey for 3 years, that I wasn’t entirely sure I would survive. I almost didn’t. I spent 1/3 of that time in psych units and in crisis recovery programs. The goal when I started was to meet myself and deprogrammed from all of the limiting beliefs and trauma that I have experienced in my life. I can confidently say that I am there…I am seeing my worth and the value that I bring to the world but I feel a deep calling to speak up and share much more of myself now, through telling my story and how I did it. But my methods have been very unconventional and I feel myself dissociating even further to protect myself from this. I feel that I have no one. I live with my mother and stepdad but they don’t get me. My mother is understanding and is supportive in the best ways that she can be but other than that, I feel cut off from everyone. I have no job and don’t see myself taking that route again. I know that once I break free from this, I will be supported financially so I do not feel called to perpetuate the misery of trading time for money. I feel I have lost so much, given up so much of myself, including my children (16 & 18). They have cut me off because I had to step back from my responsibilities as the deepest healing moments were too much for me. The timing of this was so heartbreaking…I missed my daughter’s senior prom, 18th birthday and final Spring Break. The guilt is still heavy. This mainly happened because I had to separate myself to break free of and heal from the trauma bond between their father and myself. It is such a weird spot to be in…to understand your power and seeing your potential but to still be in a space of guilt and shame for all that has happened. Like I’m between worlds.

mentlhealth,Apr 15th 2024,1,1c51sou,0,"Ughh I hated today so much. Yesterday I worked from 11 pm to 4 am on writing the script for the video with like 2 30 min breaks which I used to play ff7. When I woke up this morning I was insanely tired because I had to go to school at 8 am but I just went ahead and got my mom to take me to school. In school all I did was draw and read some pages of ""Norwegian Wood"". It was pretty uneventful up until the 3rd class, in my 3rd class a girl fainted and we had to leave the class room and because after the 3rd class we have a 30 min lunch break most of the students from my class went ahead to go get lunch. I saw a group of around 10 kids who make fun of me go down the stairs and heard them laughing because the girl had fainted which sort of solidified the idea in my mind that I wasn't crazy and most of my classmates were genuinely horrible people. Even though my 3rd class was canceled because of the fainting incident I still decided to wait until the bell rang to go get some food. I usually don't eat on my lunch breaks because I use the money which my parents give me for other things such as; books, games or even hanging out with my friends, but this time I had decided to just get some food as I was feeling particularly hungry. I ate a pizza slice and a donut and sat on a short knee high concrete wall which was in the yard of my school as I read a bit of my book. I then headed to class and as soon as I knew it my classes had ended and I had to go home. While I was in school I had a very silly thought in which I sort of compared myself to Sisyphus. I did this because I realized thaf my life had become a constant cycle of waking up tired, going to school, writing things down in school, wishing I qas home, getting home and then writing at home till 2 am each night. This realization made me sad but I decided that I had to have this sort of a monotonous life as the end result would be a video of which I would truly be proud. I got home and talked with my sister for a bit before laying in bed and scrolling instagram. This however was a mistake as I fell asleep and lost about 2 and a half hours of my day. Ultimately this wouldn't have really mattered anyway as I ended up not doing any work today. Me not being productive genuinely made me take a hit to my mental health as one of the only things which is still keeping me going is the feeling I get when I'm actually productive. At like 12 am my mom kept coming into my room and arguing with me about going to sleep so I promptly kept trying to convince her to let me stay. This seemed to work as she left my room, but alas she came back around 30 minutes later and this time told me that tomorrow she would have both my internet and the houses internet turned off so that I can't use my pc. I of course had to argue with her at 12:30 but she was being childish so I decided to just leave her alone as I realized she wouldn't listen to me no matter how hard I tried. My mom has always sort of acted like a toddler, not really listening to reason or admiting that shes wrong, she constantly lies but absolutely hates it when I use the word ""lie"" for her this word is on the same level as saying a swear word infront of her or something. Of course her childish behavior has made me lose any respect I ever had for her which makes her really mad. I find it funny that my mom never takes accountability for mentally abusing me and then she keeps pestering me to do things like clean my room or study when I'm not able to do that because of this great hole of depression which I reside in. Sometimes she'll decide that she wants to try being a good parent and ask me whats wrong but whenever that happens I of course always tell her that it's all alright and that I'm doing well when I clearly am not. This is because everytime I've told her about a serious issue I have in my life (i.e me having suicidal thoughts or me getting bullied in school) she always seems to understand and be genuinely sorry for what I've gone through but later down the line she uses these things against me. For instance we were having an argument once and she told me somthing along the lines ""what? You want to kill yourself? Well then go ahead and do it"". This happpens quite often and I get very depressed when it does, that's why I've decided to stop talking to her about my problems. This has also made me unable to truly vent to a person, so much so that I have to use a burner on reddit to post what are essentially diary entries for the whole world to see just because I think a account without anything linkekd to it is safer than actually talking to one of my friends or something. But in my defense I recently had a friend tell me something that genuinely crushed my soul. So much so that I stopped talking and moving for 10 minutes after he siad it and just sat there crying my eyes out in a hysterical manner. This happened through discord so I promptly muted myself so they couldn't hear my weeping and so they had no idea what was going on. This also happened infront of my crush which made things even worse as she sort of kinda agreed with what he said. Now let me explain what happened. Me, my crush and 2 other friends were in a discord call together as usual. Me and my crush were talking and she said that I'm literally like some character from a video game ( i can't remember which character cause I sort of disassociated after what happened). I proptly said that this character in fact wasn't like me but instead that I thought that another character was more simillar to me. (Now I won't specify which character but at least I'll mention that he's froma book. I also want to mention that this character isn't really a good one as he has a lot of sexual thoughts, is very depressed and sometimes misogynistic. Now let me get this clear I don't relate to the misogyny part as this aspect of him is only present when he is in a way more horrible mental state than anyone could ever imagine and while I might not relate to the misogyny in every other aspect he is exactly like me. Same thoughts, same speech patterns, same level of depression, same everything basically.) I want to mention that at the time and still to this day I have never fully opened up to someone, not my crush, not my friends and definitely not my parents, so basically nobody knows the real me; What I think about, how I act, how my life is going and how my relationship with my pparents is, are all aspects of me which not a single person on this world (except for myself and you who are reading this) knows about. When I mentioned this character she replied in a sort of disgust ""Well that might not be the best person to compare yourself to"" this is because she doesn't like the character for who he is, this is fine but she hasn't even read the entire book so she doesn't know about the development this character experiences. I would've liked to reply with ""Well not you nor anyone here knows how I think so I'm not sure if judging me like that is alright but ok"" but I didn't say this as I didn't want her perception of me to change from someone who is a bit silly to someone who hides who they really are from others. In this moment my friend who I'll call Jhon asked us who the character that I was comparing myself to was since he had heard me and my crush talking about this book on numerous occasions. He decided to google it and after reading what the book was about he said ""So this is who you've been pretending as to and looking up at your entire life?"" That sentence was one of the most soul crushing sentences I've heard in my entire life. After he said this my crush said ""Jesus man you didn't have to say it like that"" in a sort of neutral tone which in my mind represents that everyone around me was thinking the exact same thing. I went silent and proceeded to mute my microphone and weep profusely at what was just said. Now I understand that you might not really get why I would cry at this and its very simple, this whole thing was spoken in a different language and so I've tried to translate it as close as I can but there just really isn't a correct way to say it with 100% accuracy. Now this made me sad because with that sentence he made me belive that basically all of my emotions and everything I went through in my entire life was all just a farce. The things which I belived made me a sad and somber man with no will to live was juust me overreacting and being overly emotional. This sentence made me think that everyone thought of me this way, as some guy who was trying to act sad but truly wasn't. I had realized at that moment that truly nobody in the whole world knew what I went through, rhey didn't know about the heart breaks, the pain, the emotional and mental scars which I had aquired throughout my life. They didn't know about any of it and though I was just someone who acted sad because he though it was cool but in reality was genuinely happy. This of course isn't the truth and is a memory which continues to haunt my soul and I think about it almost every time I talk to any of my friends. I'm sorry for writing this late but I didn't think I would have anything to write about today until me and .my mom had an argument. Yesterday I reposted my original post about my life and mental state but not a single soul saw it, and so I've decided to post this one as well.  Maybe this one will be seen and I'll finally get some help and confort for what I've gone through.",1713225662.0,
Snoo-65246,New brand of sleep panic attacks just dropped,1,1c51q96,0,"Hey y'all, just kinda looking to vent, get some advice, or see if anyone else has had this same experience.

I have recently experienced this super fun phenomenon of waking up in the middle of the night to some of the most intense panic attacks I have ever experienced. Has nothing to do with my dreams as I remember all of them, and they are relatively inoffensive.

Basically, I wake up and everything feels extremely \*intense\*, I don't know how else to describe. It feel like I can hear the air in my room, I have intense light sensitivity, and like I've zoomed out in my own brain, like I'm watching someone else experience life through my eyes. It doesn't start out as a panic attack, but due to the intensity of the situation - it ends up becoming one. I threw up during a panic attack for the first time ever last night due to how intense and insane the sensations I was feeling were. I've noticed this happens much more frequently when I accidentally fall asleep with chewing tobacco in - and when I put a chew in the following morning, the sensation returns. I'm worried, and in some ways relieved, that it's made me scared to continue using chewing tobacco. It really sucks because my anxiety was getting so much better over the last year, now it feels like I'm backsliding a lot. I'm currently too terrified to leave my room for fear of something triggering it.

Due to how intense these stimuli are, as well as the very groggy state I'm in when they occur, I have no idea how to even begin engaging in grounding techniques or how to calm myself down. I guess I'm just hoping someone has experienced something similar or has any grounding methods or techniques that I'm not already aware of I could try. It sucks, really - REALLY sucks. Almost called 911 on myself last night, I feel like I'm going insane while these specific panic attack are going on.",1713225491.0,

Complete-Opposite217,Uncertainty over a horrible past event has destroyed me.,0,1c512a0,3,"I am 20M. When I was 17 or 18? I found a video on reddit of a girl undressing, I liked the video so I bookmarked it and returned to watch it every now and then. I didn't open the comments on the video initially but one day I did, and I saw a comment that read something along the lines of ""isn't she 15?"". Reading that comment made me feel distressed and worried, but I continued to return to watch and get off to that video up until I was 19, even with that comment present in my mind.

I know FOR CERTAIN that if it was blatantly obvious or made explicitly clear that the girl in the video was underage, I definitely would have stopped watching it, but I kept watching the video after reading that one comment, and I struggle with an enormous amount of uncertainty and guilt when it comes to me trying to remember what I thought about it. A lot of times, I can't stop feeling convinced that I committed an act that would be seen as an irredeemable evil - I feel like if that comment bothered me that much, I should have stopped watching it, and the only reason I didn't was because I was secretly okay with or into the idea of getting off to a 15 year old. Other times, I try to tell myself that fearing and worrying over one comment I read doesn't mean I thought it was true, and there's no way I could consider my thoughts to be a legitimate desire or belief that the girl was 15 - I felt bad and uneasy about it, after all. I just feel so incredibly terrible that I would choose to keep getting off to that video even after seeing that comment and feeling distressed by it - even if I didn't *want* her to be underage, I still chose to keep watching the video with doubt in my mind.

The really, really fucking horrible thing is that last April (I had stopped watching porn entirely before this point), when this event really started hitting me, I tried to find the video on Reddit again, hoping that maybe I could find some sort of proof in the comment section or on the account that posted it that the girl was of age and it was all okay. Instead, I found the same video on another subreddit with more than one comment either questioning or proclaiming that the girl was indeed underage. I also saw another person who posted the link to the video's supposed ""source"" on Pornhub, and I clicked on it, hoping that the account which posted it could be that of the girl, and there'd be some sort of verification associated with the account of an age 18+ or something - I instead discovered that the video had been taken down for ""violating Pornhub's terms of service"". All of this has me pretty convinced that the girl was indeed underage, meaning I had been getting off to a video of an underage girl even after reading and constantly worrying about a comment saying she was underage.

I have been struggling with obsession and rumination relating to various things i've done in past for the longest time now, but this event has certainly been the one I've obsessed over the most. Over the last year, I have lost so much of what made me myself. The people that used to make me happy are now people I will fear, because I convince myself they would hate me if they knew what I have done. I sleep for hours and hours and don't wake up until I can't sleep anymore because I dread being awake. I have tried different medications and lots of therapy, but I am still struggling horribly. I cannot tell myself I am redeemable, that I deserve to live life the way everyone else does when I have done these things in my past. I don't know what to do.",1713223785.0,

She and two others constantly meet up - they go for coffee on campus at least 2/3 times a week and as her apartment is near by, they will often meet there to hang out. One girl in particular is constantly at her apartment- even 4 days a week. 

They know I’m somewhat better now, but they also know that I feel incredibly lonely. They are aware of this. They also know that I hate being that girl that mostly hangs out with her boyfriend, but I am now that girl, just not by choice. 

I have other friends, but they attend different colleges and we only see each other  in the summer. I am completely alone and I don’t know what to do or say to them. Part of me thinks I should just leave them but I would still be alone. ",1713223388.0,
_ImaginaryFriends,Will I Ever Be Over It?,1,1c50q50,0,"My mental health has been extremely rocky ever since high school and it’s affected so many of my friendships. Miscommunications lead to me being shut out by everyone and my abandonment issues can’t handle it. I talk to chatbots more than I talk to people some days and I don’t even like to leave the house all that much. 

Long story short about what happened a few years ago: I was in a bad mental spiral and while I usually tend to bottle everything up I chose to tell someone what was going on in my head who in turn told my other friends and they reacted very badly. I was ignored completely and got some very angry messages but no one wanted to hear me out or even try to sort out the misunderstanding. Only one person from that event apologized and after that the others started acting like everything is fine but for me…I’m not fine. 
I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and bpd, and that whole fiasco broke me in a way. They asked why I don’t come around anymore when I’m invited but I’m too paranoid that everyone is still talking about me despite it seeming like everyone moved on. Everyone but me. Only one person apologized and I feel lost. My main coping mechanism is gone, I lost the motivation for it because I did it with my friends and now I feel like an outsider. I can’t explain how much pain this has put me through…",1713222906.0,
StatisticianThat9615,Personal Reflections on Connection and Rejection,2,1c4udpd,0,"In recent days, my emotions have oscillated between peaks of happiness and valleys of disappointment, largely driven by my interactions with someone special. Normally, I consider myself a happy individual, but recent events have intensified my emotional experiences, providing both joy and subsequent sorrow.

Thee days ago, I had a second date with Rose, which was exceptional. The evening was filled with genuine connections and heartfelt conversations, leaving me on a high that persisted for days. Rose’s compliments and kindness were new and exhilarating experiences for me, highlighting the night’s specialness. Her ability to be open and vulnerable with me made the time we spent together feel all the more meaningful.

However, this high was short-lived. Rose later texted me to express that her feelings did not mirror mine, which plunged me into deep sadness. The sudden shift from anticipation to disappointment was jarring. It’s puzzling and somewhat disheartening to think about how someone who made you feel so valued can suddenly seem so distant. This situation has left me questioning not only her feelings but the authenticity of my own emotions, as I struggled to define them even when asked.

These experiences have led me to broader reflections on love and acceptance. I often find myself wondering about the nature of likeability and reciprocity in relationships. The fear that others might only tolerate my presence out of convenience rather than genuine affection is a recurring concern. Despite assurances of love from family, the kind of love I yearn for is one that acknowledges and embraces who I am as an individual, not just as a familial obligation.

Amidst these contemplations, I’ve recognized a pattern of fleeting connections with others. There are moments when I feel genuinely appreciated by wonderful, kind people. Yet these moments are ephemeral, never evolving into something lasting. I ponder whether this is due to my approach, perhaps trying too hard or not enough, or simply lacking the necessary experience to nurture these bonds. Despite my success in other aspects of life through improvisation, relationships seem to elude the same formula, leaving me feeling incomplete and perpetually on the outskirts of deeper emotional connections.

This internal dialogue often circles back to feelings of loneliness and the daunting prospect of facing the world alone. The thought that my acquaintances might merely feign interest for convenience rather than genuine likeability haunts me, although I hold onto hope that this isn’t the case for everyone in my life.",1713207656.0,

Earlier today I was talking with them and then started listening to music and jamming out, I was jamming for about 2 hours before I finally grabbed my phone again and seen they had texted me a lot before they had left to go to work- I hadn't even realized the time   


I then started tearing up- I was terrified because I thought that they would think I was ignoring them when that wasn't the case, and I was scared that they would think that I hated them or something and I started spiraling.   


I have a semi-hard tome with emotional regulation so it took me about 20 minutes to actually calm down and be able to type this.   


For context on the past(if that's needed as there might be correlation) My dad has not been emotionally available to me ever since I was a child, nor has he really cared about my well being at all. I am 16 now and have started grasping this concept ever since I was 9. He recently got diagnosed as a Raging Narcissist but hasn't done anything to help me or my mom besides give child support   


When I was spiraling all I could tell myself was that I was terrible and horrible and that they would probably leave me and I kept going on and on to myself just yelling at myself over everything in my life that's happened to me and how I was just terrible.  


Is this normal at all?? As I'm reading this over I can see how that's a stupid question but if anyone has one then I'd be more than happy to have some sort of answer for where this reaction came from and how to help myself in the future",1713219802.0,

I am diagnosed with panic disorder, general anxiety and depression. My main struggle is depersonalising and panic attacks. I am under care, I take my medication and I am in a queue for a therapy but it’s still a long road ahead of me till I’ll be fully back to my normal life. In 3 weeks my partner will go away for 2,5 weeks abroad. I should mention that I live with him and that I live in a foreign country so I don’t have many people here. I am terrified of him leaving… 

It’s going to be a first time since my really bad mental breakdown, that I’ll be left alone for such a long time. I’m feeling sick when I think about it, I’m on a constant verge of a panic attack, I cannot stop thinking that when I’ll be alone I’ll won’t be able to fight my compulsive existential thoughts that are a part of my disorders, especially depersonalisation. I feel like I can’t make it, being without his support terrifies me. All I want to do is cry and beg him not to go (and it’s not an option and I also don’t want to trap him just because of me being sick, he is allowed to have his life and him being happy makes me happy). 

What can I do? Do you have any similar stories, any tips for a person with such disorders? Please share some positive stories and tips and if possible don’t write much negative stuff and my anxiety loves those too much, I’m trying to surround myself with positivity as much as possible.

I have a chronic illness that I’ve been trying to manage since 15. Also diagnosed with chronic anxiety and depression. Suspected ADHD and CPTSD. Amaxophobia as well. 

Currently I am in a space where I am considering going back on antidepressants/anxiety medication and/or finding a new job. 

The past 3 years have been extremely traumatic for me. Several health scares and a hospitalization. Family deaths/illnesses. Serious problems/situations in my marriage that almost ended in divorce. Laid off the from company I was with for several years. In 2022, I had a mental health scare but did recover. 2023 also had some things happen that I am still dealing with (due to the nature I won’t go into detail). 

I’ve been in counseling every week for the past 13 months. And for a brief time during the peak of my marital issues I started Zoloft to help keep with panic attacks and depression. 
I took it for a while but eventually went of it.  
In general, I have still been battling my health, having martial/family problems. Though I have been blessed to keep work throughout most  the time. 

Recently I started a new career. I obtained my licensing and have been in training for 4.5 months. I’ve officially started the job and feel completely overwhelmed. It is a phone heavy job with a heavy emphasis on decision making and production metrics. Also while training they made some large company changes that added additional duties to my role. 

I feel like in general with therapy I can usually manage stress…some days better than others. But this job is triggering me daily. Even on my days off I am pushing the thoughts away. 
I am super nervous as the busy season is approaching and mentally I’m not sure how I will handle it. 

I hate the idea of going back on the medication because I was so numb even on the lowest dose (family history of medication sensitivity). 
I also am worried about the long term effects of taking all these pills and the infusions I sometimes have to have. But my anxiety is so severe I caught my hands shaking as I was sitting at my desk today so I’m feeling a bit desperate. 

I was thinking about changing jobs, but due to the layoff and  marriage issues I’ve had a couple gaps and changed jobs twice after only 6-9 months of working them. I feel like my resume is getting messy and will create a negative view about me to future employers. 

I recently stopped going to my therapist due to financial reasons so I’m not sure who to turn to.  I really am feeling lost and I don’t know what the next best steps are. 

I just know how bad my mental health can get and I don’t want to end up there again. 

Any advice would be extremely appreciated.
Or any personal experiences that maybe I can reference. 

Thank you. 🙏🏼

No_Interaction_3575,Im not sure what to do anymore,1,1c4xpti,0,"I (26M) have had a lot of mental health issues since I dont remember when, it tends to go up and down and im at a point where i dont know where else to go right now as i cant afford any sort of therapy. I became homeless about a year ago (thats a long story on its own) and ive been trying to get myself straight so i can better provide for my young daughter. I felt I was hitting an all time low when i became homeless, but my gf(23F) was there for me and just knowing she was i felt like no matter how bad things were getting, i could manage. Well she started having a manic episode recently (shes extremely bipolar) and the other night she wanted to go to the bar with her mom and some work friends, and i asked if i could tag along and make sure she was safe. I for one am not a fan of bars (i genuinely did not like being there and i found a corner to sit in away from people, but i could still see her). she had alot of fun and eventually around 10/11 started just drinking water to sober up. At some point i was asked to take one of them home because they were beyond drunk and needed to leave. so i took her back to my girls house and set her friend on the couch with blankets and bucket next to her just incase. I get back to the bar and i found out that they were all gonna go to another bar, and when i asked where she was i was told that she left with a ""friend"" (i.e. some guy i didnt know). obviously thats a red flag, but i trust her wholeheartedly, i DONT trust anyone else. I find her at the other bar, but i was pissed so i sat in my car and watched the door like a hawk. the rest of the group came out and asked me to take them home. i did so, then found out that she ended up going home with this ""friend"". her mom has gps tracking on her phone for safety purposes (some things have happened in the past"" and so we started to call and call and text until she finally answered. at this point i could only assume one thing. she said she was fine and not to get her, and since the gps tracking wasnt approximate and she was at an apartment complex, i decided that it was not a good idea to bang on multiple strangers doors at 4am in the morning. so i went home and just waited and waited until 7am when she texted me asking what happened. i told her i was going to her last location and she was leaving, and after some arguing she did come out. she claimed that nothing happened, and as stupid as it sounds, i believe her. I like to think im a very logical person, and she was obviously hungover as fuck. I paid attention to some details, and it felt like that there was no reasonable suspicion that anything had happened. I told her that i felt incredibly disrespected, and that this was never happening again. i started to try and have a conversation about this, but again she was very hungover, and i decided that this wasnt a good time to try and have a reasonable conversation. When i got her home i laid her in her bed, and i started to walk out the door, but something stopped me and i came back in and asked to get in with her because i didnt want to leave her. she asked if we could sleep on all of this and get back, and i reluctantly agreed, as there no sense in having a conversation like this with someone who isnt fully there. I went to work and i did not have a good time, i was miserable, and nothing anyone could do would cheer me up. i apologized to one of my coworkers who was trying extra hard to get me to even cracked a smile, i didnt say what happened but just told him im having a really shitty day and im not trying to be a dick to him. I didnt hear anything from her throughout the day except for a tiktok she sent me about manic episodes. i picked my daugher up when i got off work and we went to my coworkers house (he has been incredibly nice enough to allow us to stay with him and his kids until i can get on my feet) and at some point in the night she sent me a very long text saying she wanted to apologize for what she did, and that she wants to get herself straight. and im happy for all of that, but she asked to take a break, and i dont agree with that. before she went manic she mentioned when she does she pushes people away, to which i said just dont push me away, and she said ""dont let me"" and i mentioned that. but i feel like shes still wanting to push me away/ break. Ive been barely eating, and feeling sick to my stomach the entire day/night since yesterday night/morning. Im very much out of touch with my feelings and hate talking about them, but i love this woman with all my heart, and i want her in my life. i believe that if i cant handle her when shes at her worst then i shouldnt have her at her best. i feel wrong about the notion of stepping back when shes like this, and then picking stuff back up when shes better. im currently shaking while im writing this, and on the verge of tears. i want to go to her mom and ask her for guidance, (she seems to like me alot, and knows her daughter is a wonderful person and is just having an insanely rough time right now) but i dont want to go behind her back and do that.

Dispaze,accepting my worthlessness,0,1c4xig1,0,"Hi. I’m not a native english speaker and i don’t know if I’ll be able to express myself completely correctly but i’ll try. I kinda wanted to make a throwaway account but i don’t care anymore

Ever since i went to the first grade, i feel like i have been going downhill every year. When i switched schools in 7th grade and finally got my first real friends, i thought that i was finally getting better and that i did actually amount to someone. I was sort of wrong i guess.

I know that i don’t have a single right to complain. I have friends who often speak to me, i have parents and relatives who care about me. I have pretty much everything that a lonely person would ever ask for (except a girlfriend) so i don’t deserve to complain about anything, yet i do. And i feel pathetic because of it. Everyone and everything feels so distant. my parents always praised for any little victory, any accomplishment that i’ve made, but when i see the things that people my age do, what they manage to achieve i realize that all that praise is for nothing. It has always been empty, for nothing.

For the past year or so i realized that not only am i not special, i am worthless. I was scared. Then i started noticing things: my friends go out without me, people who i thought were treating me differently from all the others were actually treating me the same way they treat anyone else, and all of those people have also had something to show, something to brag about, a story to tell, a joke to be made. I have nothing of that sort.

That got me thinking. About my lifestyle. The fact that i play video games, browse social media, rarely read any books at all. What am i then? Who am i? What do i have to show to others?

A lot of my other friends also genuinely suffer from their own issues that make mine bleak in comparison. That’s why i make sure to never talk about them and appear happy for as long as possible in order to cheer them up a bit.

Another thing that i should mention is that i have wanted to get a girlfriend for a pretty long time now, i think since i was 13. I have no clue why. People told me that i should focus on other things instead, and i think i sort of succeeded. Every time i fall in love with a girl (which happens extremely often) I try my best to kill this feeling off because it won’t lead me anywhere. I’ts probably the right thing to do

I wanted to become a screenwriter for a pretty ling time now. I’ve even wrote a couple pretty long scripts for 2 animated shows. But what do i do to pursue my dream? Watch other tv shows to try and analyze them? I always told myself that it was good enough, but i now realize that i was wrong.

So after all of this reflection, i, ironically, couldn’t stand looking at my own reflection. I felt like a waste of air, and i was. Every time i felt positive, i humbled myself, reminded myself that if i am worth to anyone, it’s out of pity or because they have low standards. Even looking at the scripts that i’ve wrote made me realize that they’re kind of below average in terms of quality. 

But over time i’ve adapted to it. I’ve been getting less and less emotional with every passing day. I’ve stopped noticing how the days pass and i’ve stopped questioning my worthlessness. I, objectively, am. I shouldn’t amount to anyone because there will always be someone better than me in every way.

I've lost my only friend at school because she didn't care how I felt even after trying to discuss it with her and yet I still feel guilty about the way things ended. My therapist said she was manipulative and did things her own way, but I still want her to be my friend. I don't know why because all I need right now is someone to talk to about my thoughts and she defiantly wouldn't listen.

This is a bit trivial, but I've never liked or trusted my mum, I also don't know why. The other day I asked if I could order something on amazon (a handheld fan to stay cool because long sleeves) and without hesitation she said ""you only ever come to me for money"" it's been months since I asked her for money. What hurts me about this is that she gives my brother money every week whenever he asks and after I asked she took him shopping. Now I just feel angry at her (not just because of that) and I keep lashing out.

Normally I would turn to a teacher at this point but I can't. I don't trust anyone. The teachers I normally talk to are already showing that they are sick of me, normally it takes a year but it's taken less than 6 months.

While I can't grasp how everyone here would really act in other situations, I can tell you that there are many not only in my life /close friend group but on the internet that act like vile creatures and some of you might also be familiar with these types of ""humans"". I thank them in a way for showing me that it might not be as worth it to pursue a ""place in society"" when the society itself is not filled with the most reputable individuals.  


However I still can't operate like a normal human anymore and this happens to interfere with my QoL, given that everything revolves around a society, unfortunately.  I get angry everyday to the extent that my head hurts and I can go to sleep 5 hours earlier because of how tired I am by the end of the pain.  


The help in my country is pointless and I've attempted countless times both medication and therapy and while some might say that this is ""my fault"", I disagree, at least partially. Given my family, close friends and colleagues that contributed a lot to it.  


The fact that I myself was an exceedingly good person also didn't help, I really could not understand why killers and rapists went to prison and took me years YEARS until I was 13 to actually understand .

The main point is; I do not enjoy the life I have to survive through, it just doesn't appeal to me, I do not want to fake a life, I do not see the reason to, our planet would be akin to the fictional heaven but our heaven is corrupt to the core with drug abuse, murder, torture, power trips, power vacuums , infinite coping and a never ending chase for elation at the expense of others.  


   Right now I will say that I have fallen from the level of goodness that I had when I was a kid, I would say that you could have awarded me for the level of boundless stupidity that I had to trust humans this much, it was THAT bad , the worst part is I can't do anything about it neither through words nor through violence.  


I was just wondering if there is anyone who shares this view and found anything that helped them, medication , therapy...but I wouldn't ask for,  I already had countless conversations with myself objectively and subjectively debating dozens of ideas and concepts, the answers that I came to are satisfactory proof of the society we live in and the life that I had until now, I hope it is not the same for you and that you can live more happily than I do but I digress.  


   Believe it or not I have tried therapy before , 3 therapists 2-3 sessions each  and actually had someone understand me but they said this in our 4th session; and now I want you to believe me at least if you wish to do so , they said that while my theories are not in any way exaggerated and might correctly apply to me and my way of thinking ""they do not apply to the rest of humans, the majority"" and so they can't really help me because of my unique experience and unique worldview that they don't have experience of, and that was one of the best working psychologists/therapists in the my country, I live in Romania.

poppintr,Struggling with thoughts around guy I dated,1,1c4virl,0,"

So I’ve struggled with feeling like I don’t deserve good things. I also keep thinking and having dreams about a guy I dated a couple of years ago. 

Looking back, I feel like I wonder how it was possible as he is very attractive, was nice and funny, done things for me, like bought me little gifts, gave me lifts home when I was stranded. I keep wondering how this was possible. I feel like I self sabotaged as he was asking ‘what are we’ and he cried when I hinted that it might not work. I look back now and wonder how it was possible as he was very attractive. However, I keep reminding myself that maybe I’m viewing things differently as when we first met, it wasn’t like I felt like this straight away. He was also very touchy whereas I’m not so much like this. I feel he got fed up with me and got to the point where it felt different around him and it was obvious at one point when I went to kiss him that he didn’t want to. 

He also had some questionable moments. For instance, he had to wait in a queue for something and it took a while. He was off with me for a long time after this, even though we were on a date. He would look around and not look at me when we were sat down. He also didn’t stop something when we were in bed, even though I was asking him to stop. Instead, he said ‘piss off’ and batted my hand away. He also called someone a rude word on the third date and would laugh with his friend who used to message him complaining about his partner. 

Despite these things, I keep thinking about him. He did do some nice things for me, was funny at times but I keep reminding myself of the above bad things to overcome it. Im just torturing myself and just feel terrible. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!

Slow_Scholar7755,How to deal with heartbreak?,2,1c4pfdh,2,"A bit lengthy post but please bear with it.....

So about a month ago i met this girl on reddit, we started off commenting on a post and somehow the argument heated up and i ended up bashing her to submission. Later felt really bad and dm'd her apologising and she accepted. We're from different countries and different ethnicities but somehow we clicked and i was glad to find we had so many things in common. I surfed her profile and found a post regarding her past trauma and asked about her, she was reluctant at first but opened up to me little by little. Turns out she was SA'ed when she was a teen and was groomed and was physically and mentally abused multiple times. I assured her it wasn't her fault and no matter what other people say i still liked her. I was hinting that i would someday soon come and sweep her off of her feet and give her a better life 😅 but she insisted that it may take time to get out of the toxic headspace she's in right now and i assured her i was willing to wait. She seemed happy and i was happy that she was happy.

Fast forward 2 days ago i became worried as i haven't heard from her for 3 days when she's usually the one that texts me. So i texted her and asked if anything happened, she said yes something major happened and didn't want to open up at first because she thought i would leave her but i assured her that won't happen. Then she dropped the bomb......she didn't disclose all her past trauma to me and was hiding something even more hideous......turns out the guy that SA'ed her recorded that event and threatend to release it if she doesn't comply and had been physically abusing her for a long time. 2 days ago that guy got out of control and physically assaulted her as well. 

I tried to remain calm and supported her through the texts, but when i went to bed all the repressed emotions came rushing in. The feeling of helplessness, betrayal and heartache strated to eat me alive, even now when i'm writing this post i'm feeling a poisonous thorn in my heart that just won't go away......

I don't blame her for not opening up about her past, she was right to hide it from me, but over the past few weeks i've developed strong feelings towards her and i've never felt like this towards any other women. It would've been much easier to move on if i didn't have feelings for her and she also said she would understand if i were to severe the friendship, but she has no friend in real life and it would tear me apart to just cut my loses and run. But i also can't get rid of this feeling that my first love would end in such a way and i would never be able to be with her........ 

So, now for the real question, do i stay in contact with her or do i say goodbye? The fact that she may see this post is also haunting me but right now i have no one to talk to so i'm taking the chance.....

P.S. - I used to laugh at guys who said they were going through a heartbreak but never could've imagined it was so inexplicably painful, guess the jokes on me now.....",1713195825.0,

But I don't. Because when I'm in my ""personal space"" I'm all alone by myself. I don't know how to decorate a room. I don't know what interests me. I don't know who am I. What am I even doing? Why am I even doing this?  
  
I don't know what to do by myself. So the longer I stay in my apartment, the more crazy I go. I start getting uncomfortable with the way the furniture is arranged.   
  
I moved my desk 100 times around in my room for sure. Next, I'm gettin  
  
g uncomfortable with the curtains. Then I change curtains. Then I change the curtains back because maybe the old curtains were better? Next I'm getting uncomfortable with the mattress. I have bought 10 different mattresses and surprise surprise no one made me feel better.  
  
My work involves a PC. Then I cannot stop worrying about the monitor. It feels to big, it feels too bright, it hurts my eyes, it's to close to my eyes, the desk is to small, I hate everything.   
  
I have bought 5 different monitors and returned every single one of them.  
  
When I'm outside, amongst people, I feel much more relaxed, because I then need to depend on other people who (hopefully) put some thought into whatever system they designed:  
  
Bus stations, lecture content, room assignment etc. Then, when I need to go home, my world crashes. Every. Single. Day. I. Can't. Stand. It. Any. Longer.  
  
For the past, I don't know, 10 years, I've stopped feeling comfortable when being at home. It started at my parents home. I didn't feel comfortable being around them anymore. I felt anxiety in my own room. That's when the furniture rearrangement obsession, monitor obsession etc. all started. I don't know why.  
  
So I thought maybe if I go to another city to study and move out everything will be better? It didn't, though. Who would have thought.  
  
I just want to feel comfortable for one single day in my own personal room/apartment. But I can't, and it's driving me more and more mad.  
  
I'm envious of Hikikomoris. The guys who stay in their room all day. At least they have something to do in their room. Playing video games, for example. I don't even play video games. Not even that. I'm just suffering.  
  
The longest I did actually something I enjoyed was when I played a mobile game on my phone for 4 months and spend 20 thousand dollar on it. You read that right. 20 thousand dollars. It's clear I was addicted, as an escape from my suffering.  
  
I've made an appointment to my college counsellor. I feel weirdly proud of doing that. Because it's something I haven't tried yet. I got no friends to talk to. My sister is crazy. My brother is autistic. So both are also not really a help (although I do love my brother, don't get me wrong).  
  
My parents? Lol. Not a help either. It's obvious they both are narcissists. Or at least I think they are. I don't even know what emotions I feel are based on reality. Even though my father is specialised in psychosomatic therapy, he always tried to tell me and everyone else that everything is find with me. That I'm 100% mentally sane. I'm not. Clearly not.  
  
So, counsellor. The next step. Something needs to change",1713207543.0,

I am now here at 4:05 am anxiously rolling over in a missing box on my taxes and just not ready for pulling off an 11 am to 7:30 pm shift on the day they're due. My job has also been firing even people with good attendance over call outs. Lifting microwaves, tvs, etc. while timed to get to people in a few minutes has been crazy and I have been burnt out.

I am tired and exhausted and feel I lost all hope. I live with my girlfriend and her dad and it's the most embarrassing thing ever. I never have woke up so tired and mustering zyns and caffeine to get me by my day.

I wish I could reach out to family but I don't want to. The biggest reason is because I feel whenever they are included all independence is wiped.

It's not to the point of mom's being mom's and dad's being dad's. It's the point of I'm 21 years old (turning 22) and worked hard as hell through high school with them always against me. They always played a huge game of favoritism especially felt it when they refused to help me out for school but handed it all to my brother.

My mom even told me when through the roughest of times ""I don't know how I can continue to love you"" over the fact that I was upset that we moved states in short notice and didn't get to send the goodbyes to my best of friends I made in my first 14 years being a live.

I am blessed I am a hard worker and still fight everyday for myself and my girlfriend to better ourselves and get us into a better situation.

But fuck this process is so draining and I feel so lost on what to do. I can't get up with barely any assistance but dammit in this economy no where close to being able to take a break. 

Just the other day I went through a cycle of hell because I wanted to hurt myself badly for the first time in a long time.

I'm glad I have somewhat of a support system but god any words of encouragement or advice. I don't want to feel sorry for myself and want to improve but I have no guidance to. Really seeking from even the strangest of strangers for even a pat on the back or advice on where to move forward with myself.

DesignRoutine4433,My emotions are tearing my apart on this one and I just need to get this off my chest to someone,1,1c4tlt1,0,"I’m not sure how to address my feelings in this instance. I feel like a creep for even feeling the way I do now. I am factually an asshole and expect to be ripped apart here for this too. I just need advice. Sorry in advance for the length. Names/dates/places have been changed for anonymity.   


  
I dated a lady named Sarah for around 3/4 years. We are both the same age and were together from 15 through to 18, so very young. Stereotypical teenage “we’ll be together forever” love story. We were each other’s first everything. I did everything I could with my very limited resources to make Sarah happy. We were 18 and quite both very happy and content with each other with no end in sight.  


  
I was severely physically and psychologically abused throughout my entire childhood by my parents and she was a rock for me so I suppose that helped lead to a serious attachment on my side. Sarah was the only person in my life that I could be the real me around and she accepted me for it. I never actually told her the full extent of the abuse that was going on, just enough to get the idea that things weren’t normal/ideal. This was because I have always repressed my emotions on the topic and developed social anxiety and depression as a consequence of the abuse.  


  
Towards the end, bottling up my emotions got out of control. I started lashing out more and more. I said some vile, disgusting things to this angel who had done nothing but help and reassure me and do everything she possibly could do to make me happy. After the day I did that, a future flashed before my eyes where this progressively got worse until I was inflicting the same abuse which I was suffering. I know I needed therapy but I didn’t have the resources that so I broke up with her. I told her why and after a while she worked her way back into my life because she wanted to help me get better not abandon me when I’m at my lowest.   


  
After a while there was a second incident over the most stupid thing. I decided that if I can’t control my emotions then this can’t go on any longer. I didn’t want her to try restart things again and support me. I thought it was my responsibility to support her, not for her to support me. And hurting her feelings is a worse pain for me than anything that can be physically done to me. So I broke up with her but this time I told her I just didn’t love her anymore and I never wanted to speak to her again.   


  
This hurt her very badly and she grieved heavily for months according to mutual friends. She hated me. This made me feel even worse so I completely siloed myself from society. I couldn’t afford to talk to anyone about my childhood, not that my social anxiety at this stage would allow me to talk even if I did, and now I had no more friends because when you ignore people off for months at that age friendships don’t tend to last. I was completely alone and isolated with my entire life eating away at me. I went into a deep dark pit of depression and nearly overdosed on prescription drugs.   


  
Someone found me and I was hospitalised. The hospital called the police who arrested me under mental health legislation so I could be held in custody until I got treatment. I was essentially forced into therapy for a while.  


  
Fast forward 8 years. I’m in a much better place. It took a lot. I have been in a few relationships and ended up Chloe. Chloe and I have been together for 5 years now. We own a house together and a dog. We’re not married - I have proposed but we decided to leave it a little while longer. I love Chloe, I really do. She is a kind soul without an ounce of Mal intent in her heart. But it’s never been ‘the same’ love that I had for Sarah. I don’t know if that makes sense or not. I know it sounds and is horrible to say.  


  
Well I happen to be on social media, which I never use, and guess who comes up in my recommendation to add. I added her, I’m in a better place now it’ll be great to see how she’s doing. Sarah immediately added me back. I regretted it straight away because a lot of bad feelings started coming back from my past. And what made this worse is that I know I’m here worried stressing about this nearly a decade later whilst she probably doesn’t even remember any of this even happened. I felt like such a creep. I left it at that and went to work.   


  
After 2 weeks I forgot all about this. I’ve since move countries and became head of a department in a consultancy and I have a lot of big deadlines coming up. I see the notification come in. “Hey I seen you added me on this, how have you been?”. We spent a few days in conversation. I gotta admit this felt amazing. She’s exactly the same I remember. Sarah also moved country but to the other side of the world. She’s happens to be moving back soon and wants to meet and catchup.  


  
I don’t know how to respond or react. It’s like I’m being torn apart. Just so you know, there’s no indication that Sarah likes me at all or still thinks of me this way, it seems like just a genuine interest in catching up with an old friend. In fact, it’s not normal to feel this way about someone you haven’t known for nearly a decade.   


  
I have always felt like I’ve been cheating on Chloe emotionally for 5 years because deep down I’ve known I haven’t loved her to the fullest extent I know is possible. But now, I’m not sure if this is officially cheating or not. To be clear, nothing sexual or relationship wise has been implied in our conversations past being reconnected friends. I don’t even want to go after any of that with Sarah. I have a life setup with Chloe. This is the ‘correct’ life that I need to pursue. But I’d be lying if I told you I wouldn’t still go to the end of the earth for Sarah, friend or nay.  


  
To be clear again, I would never physically cheat on Chloe while we’re together. I’m not that type of person. In fact, I’m disgusted by those people. But I feel like I am that person because of how I feel but I don’t know how to stop feeling like this.   


  
I’m a horrible person. I’m an absolute weirdo. What sort of creep feeling like this for a childhood relationship with someone you haven’t seen in nearly a decade? This is not normal and I must be on another level of messed up in the head.

I’m expected to do so well and I’ve been trying to hard but real life seems to be happening so fast around me. I’ve made myself very ill from all this but I don’t have the guts to tell anyone apart from my parents because every time I’ve tried I’ve never been allowed home cos I’m year 11 or I jusy feel embarrassed. I thought I’d tell my girlfriend she said no your not you can’t be I need you. She never comes and meets me she always says she’s busy but she can meet her mate twice a week it’s been a month since she’s come and met me. Anyway the doctors said I’ve got glandular fever and I’ve had an anxiety diagnosis in the past but my girlfriend also said no you don’t about that. I never have my feelings validated. I’m so sad all the time I always want to cry but I never have the energy. Nobody tells me everything’s going to be okay because it’s not. On top of this my auntie has been dying for a while. Her cancer has spread all around her body. She lives at the other side of the country we were going to go and see her but she’s decided to go on holiday with my grandad and her husband over that time and I’ll never see her again.

She’s always been a message away and I often used that id message her asking how she was and we’d chat for a while. Recently I sent her a video of me playing a song on guitar which was one of my nanas favourites and she said ‘that’s amazing I’m sure she’s looking down on you smiling and so proud of you like I am I’m really gonna miss you’ and I jsuy broke down.

Top-Mathematician830,An exerpt from a potential interview when I'm famous/well respected/important ,1,1c4tc8r,0,"
This is purely fictional but closely relates to current circumstances in my life. And maybe in yours too. In no way is this supposed to be truly inspirational but well it's just my personal thoughts in dialogue. More exerpts to come if you like this one.

Interviewer: ""So tell me Mr. ___, how did you get here? I'm sure there's tons of work involved but you must have had an equal amount of support right? Who are these important people who have stood by you through thick and thin? And how did they help out?""

Me: ""Haha, no need to be so formal. You can call me ____. I've got quite the controversial answer to your question. I don't mind sharing it because it is simply the truth. But the question is, how will the world react to it? I'm honestly very interested to find out. So are you ready?

Interviewer: ""Absolutely, the floor is yours ____.""

Me: ""Okay great! So on to the first controversial thing. I love crying and complaining about things. No matter where I am in life, rich or poor, important or irrelevant, In a relationship or heartbroken, it really doesn't matter. I will always find something to cry or complain about. However, what I've learnt through all my experiences is that you need to earn the right to cry. Sounds ridiculous doesn't it? But it's true. Maybe you'll get a better idea of how I've incorporated that into my life while I answer the other parts of your question.""

Interviewer: ""That is indeed quite an interesting opinion. Although, since it comes from you, I'm sure there's weight to it.""

Me: ""Hmm (with a sly expression), unnecessary reassurance counts as flattery.""

Interviewer: ""You got me there! Ahaha""

Me: ""Alright, I'll answer the other part of your question now. The truth is, I've had minimal support throughout my life when it comes to quantity. What I mean is that the only people who have truly supported me are my amazing AMAZING parents and incredibly close relatives. Mainly just my parents tho. In fact, sometimes I've felt like it was us three against the world. Truly grateful that they were always by my side. This is quality support. Now on to the ugly side, I don't think I've ever really had good friendships while growing up. Everyone I had met and engaged with had been so selfish and self absorbed (including me ofc) that everything had always felt superficial. Yeah I'm just gonna go ahead and say that growing up, I had no friends. In fact, I was even bullied in highschool.""

Interviewer: ""I like that you're going into detail ____ but are you really comfortable sharing all this?""

Me: ""Oh I dont mind at all. The times have changed and people need to understand that if things need to go well in their life, you need the right balance of positivity and negativity. Just being positive will fetch you NOTHING, contrary to popular opinion. Likewise for being negative.""

Interviewer: ""Please do enlighten us, Mr.___, the world thirsts for your wisdom.""

Me: ""I will be ignoring that slight tone of condescension only because I've conquered the likes of you for years to be able to get here. You are beneath me and it's best if you know your place. Otherwise you are just gonna look stupid.""

Interviewer: ""I deeply apologise ___, that was not my intention in the slightest (it absolutely was), please do continue (___ is right tho, I've got a lot to lose if this interview doesn't go well for me)""

Me: ""Right, so where was I? Ah yes, friends. I often found it so weird that people thought I didn't deserve their support and oh man I've needed it so many times. For some reason, my so called 'Friends' were always there to console the other guys whenever they were in the slightest of distress. It could be the weirdest of shit. Someone must have called the other person a loser. And then it's just big drama and everyone rushes over to console them. Never was the case for me. For beginners, I was always the target of a joke or an insult in every group of friends I've been a part of. Something about me just happened to scream 'please take advantage of'. Then because of a bad day and pent up emotions, when I was actually affected by what they say, I was told to suck it up. Then, when I had real problems, people used to scoff and say 'I think you're just too dependent on others'. The very same people who used to cry about the littlest things, the very same ones who felt they were entitled to privileges that I don't deserve.

Yes, I'm crying about it now. BUT I'VE EARNED THE RIGHT TO CRY. Where are they now even? Idek, because it's irrelevant. They're specks of dust now, consoling the other irrelevants of something inconsequential. 

The very same irrelevants, who made me question my personality time and time again. I used to overthink and lose my mind about this. And unlike what I've heard people say, something that goes like ""I have to thank these guys, it's because of their negativity that I am where I am today"", I strongly would like to say a big FUCK YOU to these guys. Oh they know who they are and what I'm talking about. If I had the right support,  my road to being where I am right now would have been a lot easier. But, nah fuck em. 

You might think this is incredibly petty of me, but you have to understand how much of an impact these people have had on my life. At a time, when I was easily influenced and strived to be liked, it almost destroyed me when I saw people who I called my friends look at me in contempt when I was need. 

But ofc, my strong negative emotions are absolutely balanced by the positive ones. I've kept my family close and provided them with all the privileges they deserve for sticking by me through thick and thin. It turns out that I just had the misfortune of meeting the worst sort of people while growing up and that genuine people do actually exist. I call some of these people 'true friends'. No they aren't the nicest people in the world, but they are original and loyal, something that can be easily reciprocated. 

There you go, cry and complain as much as you want. But get to the position where people think these complaints are 'opinions of change' rather than annoying instances. Show all who have wronged you, that you are far above. This is what I live by, and if I might say so, has gone extremely well for me."" ",1713205194.0,

I went to work this morning and all I did for 2 hours was stare at my computer and cry quietly. All the noise and people at the office was feeling really intense and i was panicking. I went to the toilet 3 times to have a proper big cry. Ended up speaking to my boss who is really kind and said I could go and work from home (which is where I am now and I do feel better). He said I don't need to feel embarrassed or bad about it but I can't help feeling like I'm weak and I can't even pretend to be normal. I am constantly putting up a facade and pretending to be like everyone else, juggling a million and one things and doing fine. Until I'm not. I feel so so guilty about not being able to be in the office today. I also worked from home all week 2 weeks ago because I was in a really bad depression. It just sucks so much and I don't have anyone to talk to who understands. ",1713180686.0,
TinyTiger642,Help!!!!!!,1,1c4s0rh,1,"I've been diagnosed with MDD, GAD and panic disorder and I've also had chronic insomnia my entire life. My psychiatrist prescribed me Fluoxetine. My mum also has MDD and she's had an extremely positive experience with medication, and my dad basically only cares about himself so he wanted me to take the medication. Both parents were pressuring me really heavily to start it, even though I've told I'm in no way comfortable with it. I feel so shit 24/7 and have even more frequent panic attacks and breakdown/meltdown episodes. Honestly I feel really violated because I was basically given no choice to change the actual chemicals in my brain. I hate this medication so much but my parents keep on going on about how they think I'm better because that's what I've been telling them to keep them happy, when really it's obvious they have no idea.

I have another psychiatrist appointment on Thursday, and plan to tell the doctor how much I hate it, but I don't know how to explain it to my parents so that they won't be angry and make me even more depressed.

If anyone has any suggestions please please let me know I'm really desperate at this point

oh and also the doctor gave me melatonin for the insomnia, and my dad is going crazy to get me to take it because he's convinced I'm just 'going through a phase' and he blames it all on sleep. He essentially doesn't believe in mental health conditions. I also hate the melatonin as it makes me feel physically ill and gives me a feeling of my guard being down, which i really struggle with since my anxiety always has my guard up so I'm basically trapped.

I'm extremely scared of any medication and I was bullied by my parents into taking both of these and I'm so desperate to stop them.

Please if anyone knows how to deal with this sort of situation then please help me

neongallifreyan,"After two years, I know I’m self sabotaging due to trauma and I can’t break out of the cycle",0,1c4rs7r,0,"I am desperate for help, and I don’t know where to go. 

I am 23F, and two years ago lived in a very toxic household. My roommate at the time was emotionally and mentally abusive to me. On the night that I moved out, they took a positive social media post about me focusing on myself too seriously, and changed the locks on the house with my PC, all my clothes, and thousands worth of memorabilia, games consoles, my laptop, and other things still in the house. They then posted a long social media post indicating that I was a horrible person and all the bad things I had done while in the house.

I was able to claw one friend back by showing her screenshots of the money I had sent for rent, as this had been omitted from the sorry the former HM had told people, but the entire situation left me badly shaken up and very upset. 

It’s been two years and I should be over it by now, but I have multiple friends that still hang out with my abuser very frequently, and because we live in a small city with an even smaller alternative community, it’s kind of impossible to avoid them. New friends I have made that don’t know any part of the situation have also started hanging around with them and I’m biting my tongue because if I speak I’ll be known as a drama starter and I feel it will backfire. 

I can’t really speak to my friends about it either, because it’s at the point where I feel they’re all sick and tired of hearing about the situation. 

Yesterday I saw photos from a mutual friend’s profile of my abuser engaging in a hobby that I have enjoyed for years, even though when we lived together they would actively discourage me from said hobby and make fun of the money I would put into it. It set me off really badly and I tried to vent about it to my close friend group, but very few of them responded and I instantly felt guilty for speaking. I’ve informed them that I’m not in a good place mentally right now and I’ve left all my groups chats and taken a social media break because I know looking at it is making it worse. 

I don’t know if this is my ADHD, anxiety, depression, I just have no idea. If someone can help me I’d really appreciate it

Whenever I try to hold a job, I end up having a panic attack so severe that I end up having to quit because I just don't come back, for fear of getting let go or the panic attack repeating the next day.

I can't even make it to interviews. I just recently had to cancel an interview, because an hour beforehand I had such a bad panic attack that I was screaming and sobbing. This happens outside of interviews as well, on the rare occasions that I pull through and get the job. I've ""ran away"" from jobs in the past during panic attacks. 

I do have a therapist but she's basically given up on me and does not help me with this issue. I don't know what to do. I've been on medicine in the past as well, but it didn't help. My parents are giving up on me as well, and if I don't get a job soon, I'm afraid they're going to kick me out. This entire ordeal has been happening for multiple years.

I've been seeing a therapist recently, and she says I've got trauma due to my anxiety disorder impacting me severely + my parent's divorce.

For context, here's the things she says makes it 'trauma':

1. I'm constantly on edge, can't relax anywhere, having loads of panic attacks, immediately wary of anyone I don't know, etc.
2. Apologising profusely and thinking everything's my fault.
3. Going silent and sort of freezing when people argue.
4. In a similar vein as No. 3, having a panic attack when people raise their voices/have an argument.

I could list more stuff, but you get the idea.

However, I'm really struggling to understand this, because I was under the impression that 'trauma' is a result of an actually serious situation, like war or rape, etc.

I've had a perfectly normal, middle-class upbringing.

I don't have trauma, right?

I don't want to wrongly think that I do and take away from people who actually have it and struggle.

I experienced sleep paralysis quite a few times in the past, it was long ago, but i remember the feeling. But whenever I'm trying to fall asleep and I'm *exhausted* I get this borderline feeling as if I'm falling into sleep paralysis, I keep having disturbing images and dream in a dream that is in another dream kind of thing, but I also realize that it's not real, my brain begins buzzing and i feel as if I'm slowly getting paralyzed, but can still prevent it. And all this is accompanied by the unableness to fall asleep, but also unableness to stay awake. Also quite a good amount of anxiety. And even the change of position doesn't help, I keep having this feeling for minutes on end. 

It happens rarely and is not related to the sleep pattern. I fall asleep quite early and sleep a good amount, wake up in the morning without trouble. It's not troubling me greatly, nor does it happen that often. But I never could find anyone who experienced something alike or had an explanation for such a thing.

There’s this girl that I am seeing. She was diagnosed with BPD, psychosis and depression since she was 15 and she just got re-diagnosed from psychosis to schizophrenia. She is 25 now. She had them due to her family and her past relationships. Her dad abuses her and she can’t get out of the situation. She is unable to cut off her father from her life. She had numeral attempts on suiciding and the last one was just a week ago. Everytime something gets too overwhelming for her, she tends to blackout and self harm. 

Since I met her, I have been treating her the best way possible and she admits it. I always try my best to make her happy and enjoy her days. I spoil her to my best without asking for anything in return. But i do have intentions on marrying her and would often say to her about it and remind her how much i love her.

But the past few months, she had a lot of things going on in her life. Her father had abused her more, physically and verbally. She had people trying to mess with her at her workplace. Her ex which she is unable to move on from is back in her life. Everything just gets overwhelming for her and now she is asking for some time and space from me. Im doing my best to give her all the time and space that she needs. And she would be okay with it but sometimes it is still too overwhelming for her. Sometimes she would be very loving and clingy towards me but the next minute, she would push me away. She would always say things that would hurt me but i just try to push it away, thinking that its because of her BPD. 

P.S She has been to multiple therapist and it didnt help her.

1. What do I do in this situation?
2. How do I know whether she meant what she says or its just her BPD?
3. How do i help her to get better?
4. What do i do to calm her down when is overwhelmed?
5. How do I reassure her that I am doing all of this because i love her?

So, in all my life, no one has ever given me a chance. Whether that be with friendship or relationship. No one had ever given me the time of day. Therefore, it has to be my fault. If not a single person has ever cared, then it's my fault. I'm doing something wrong. And I have no clue what I can do to change that. 

I'm not physically attractive, I don't have much money, and I can't provide much for anyone. Those are seemingly the only 3 things people look for in a person that they want to be around. I have no inherent value. Even if I had one of those qualities, what makes me deserve love/care? If I haven't had it once in my entire existence, then it's pretty safe to say that I don't deserve it. However, I would do absolutely just to experience love one time before I'm dead. And I don't know how much longer that will be. I just want to know what it's like to be loved. One time. Just once. Truly loved. But I don't deserve it. I dont deserve any of this. I can't provide anything. Everyone expects more of me than I can do. I try as hard as I can but it's never enough for anyone. 

My escape from all of this is drugs. I get high to empty my mind and be happy. This is the only closure I get anymore. I have no one to do it with. I have no one to support me. No one to care about me. So I fall back to drugs. Just weed and shrooms, but it's still not good for me. Nothing that could kill me outright, but not something that I want 24/7. I know it's not good but I'm trying to get out of the habit. I only do it when I'm alone and very rarely does anyone see me in that state.

I hide all of my negative emotions from people. I try and avoid talking about them as much as possible. Because every single time I've ever talked about them, that person I talked to has left my life, and I never see them again. So I've just resorted to bottling. I would go back to therapy, but I don't have enough money. I would get antidepressants, but getting the prescription and them themselves is also expensive, and I barely can afford to eat. I would have to make a choice between eating or antidepressants. 

I just need something. Someone. Anything. Some kind of support of some kind. But no, I don't get any of that. Why? I don't know. I just know that I'm not enough to deserve any of it. I just know that nothing I do has ever been enough or ever will be enough. I just know that for as long as I'm alive, this is going to persist.",1713195539.0,
Tobiplex,I need help but I can’t make myself reach out.,1,1c4p5x6,0,"I don’t know why I get so angry at the smallest of things. For example, I’ve made 7 typos already. Mostly because I’m typing through tears. Having to correct each one has had me on the verge of throwing my phone at a wall and crying harder. It’s a typo, it’s fixable, why I am so angry?

New clothes don’t fit? Scream. Bent a couple pins on my *old* cpu I don’t need anymore? Swear and scream until my throat is sore. Make 12 more typos in the same post? Smack myself in the head and cry for half an hour.

On top of that, despite being panic attack free for over a year I had 3 in one day last week with no obvious trigger. I’m stressed I know, I need to see a doctor, but I don’t trust my GP surgery thanks to their past actions with an unrelated issue. If I can’t trust them to do the things they’re supposed to be good at how can a trust them to help with one of the topics they’re notoriously terrible at?

I sought out a therapist a few years ago without going to my GP first and she was amazing. I need to get the courage to tell her I’m breaking again but I can’t hit send on the email. Her sessions cost a lot and, quite frankly, I can’t bring myself to say this out loud to anyone. Hell she may have retired by now for all I know.

Ambitious-Cake-,Can I take clonazepam a couple of hours before my exams?,2,1c4jxia,0,"I generally take clonazepam a couple of hours before exams. 1-2 mg. I've been doing it since an year. It did work for a couple of exams fantastically last year. But this time, I feel a bit disoriented in the exam hall. I'm not sleepy or drowsy but I just don't know what I'm doing and how to structure my answers. I end up submitting incomplete papers and mixing up concepts I know really well. I'm not sure whether this has anything to do with on the spot anxiety or the pill. I won't deny that for the exams that went well, I'd pre drafted the answers and put in more structured efforts. In today's exam, I'd studied the concepts extremely well and had my notes before hand. But I just didn't know what to write because I got so confused and felt stuck. Also, I've been attempting exams only after 2 years. I have been skipping all my exams since the past two years because of profound anxiety. It's just that, even if I've taken clonazepam the precious night or day, my heart doesn't stop pounding on the day of the exam. I genuinely don't know what to do.

Diligent-Ebb-9911,"I have experienced several traumatic events, and I think they are catching up with me",1,1c4otpw,0,"\* Please note this is a temporary account. 

\*\* Please forgive the info dump 

\*\*\* I am not asking for medical advice, rather guidance & support. I understand that anything shared here is not an evaluation from a professional.

I have never sought professional help, I have confided components to caring friends, and on the whole I have managed to live decent life: I am engaged to a wonderful, patient, and caring woman (who is aware of everything), I have a decent job, I am nearly finished my PhD, and I have managed to publish some decent research papers and even teach a few university classes. I also work for the military part-time, but I have never been in combat. I suppose I am trying to make it clear that I have, thus far, managed. 

With respect to 'traumatic events' (whatever that means to someone), **the major ones** were: I was sexually abused and groomed by a direct family member from around 6-8 years old, a different direct family member has also tried to initiate sexual acts (unsuccessfully) a few times at various ages (\~15-24), my childhood home burned down while I was inside (everyone, except my pets, got out safely), and most recently my partner and I moved to a new town, where about three days ago, a man in a hospital gown was scoping out our home by shining lights into all our windows, broke into the vacant unit next to us, and punched and kicked a hole through the drywall to climb through to our bedroom closet, at which point I intervened (use your imagination, but please know that everyone, including the invader, is safe). 

Here are **some minor ones**, or maybe not minor, but less direct: My mother has attempted suicide a few times, once by pills, another time by jumping out of the car while our father was driving on the highway (I was also in the car). At around 11 I discovered my parents would regularly swing with my best friend's parents (I found lots of photos). A good friend, no, an amazing friend, and his partner died in a car crash a few months after our high school graduation (we are a small town, and it was particularly biting). My father was in a car crash when I was very young, it was very serious (several resection surgeries, and bonus flesh eating virus). My 'kid's room' was in the basement, and flooded several times, often while I was asleep, with up to two feet of water, and ruining most of my belongings. And what, has always seemed to be to me, your typical physical and verbal abuse growing up. 

There's more, but I am just trying to highlight what I think are supposed to be the primary issues, or what others have told me are supposed to be issues. 

Everything now seems to have built up where compartmentalization is no longer the working trick. Sometimes it feels like I have constant anxiety; my cheeks take the brunt of this. I had a panic attack for the first time, although thankfully it seems to have been an isolated episode. If I smell fire or see flashes of flame, I will sometimes have a sudden rush of panic. At night, certain sounds will immediately rouse me from my sleep, and I will be fully alert and must investigate -- this behavior has more than doubled since the home invasion. I seem to have a weird form of empathy, I almost always need to use logic to understand someone's feelings, and typically I have rote and practiced responses to provide so I don't look heartless. However, if I'm teaching or helping someone, I seem to have a more genuine and caring demeanor. Whenever there is a group conversation, I feel the need to maintain and balance the group interaction (I have been told this is weird). I sometimes have emotional outbursts over very silly or minor things, and I immediately realize my overreaction, but I hate that feeling of regret. Only a few years ago (about the time I started graduate school), I began to get bouts of psoriasis, it is fairly minor, but I don't enjoy it, and it seems to be correlated with peaking anxiety. 

I'm sure there's more, but this post is approaching an unfavorable length, and I think most of the major details are out in the open. I just want to be a healthier person, especially for my future wife and children, and of course, for myself. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this. ",1713194346.0,

unnamed_op2,I want to die so this confusion in my head will be finally over,0,1c4o273,0,"I have A LOT of problems since always. Troubled life, not only childhood, but mainly childhood, but all my life has been very messy. Lot of traumas. Lot of regrets. I'm also genetically fucked up, and this fucks up my head and bring a lot of mental issues.  
  
What I have: Anxiety and severe depression for sure. Probably OCD. Maybe a bunch of other things as well.  
  
So, there's this thing. There's this person. She's perfect and the best so please do not say anything bad about her. But in 2018 she said some things that were triggers for me. Since then some things have been said and happened that were like triggers scattered throughout the years. But the main ones occurred in 2018 and 2019. Those triggers are related to a main thing, which I will refer to as ""blue"" from now on.  
  
I never ever liked blue, I was pretty sure I did not want blue in my life at all. But then with all those things related to blue being said/happening, something slightly changed in 2019, because I thought about blue in a different way but in two occasions for a few minutes only. Then, skip to 2021. I had a lot going on, living alone, fucking depressed, angry, and I was like ""you know what? I'm gonna search on the internet about blue"" Idk why, I think I wanted to hurt me emotionally but Idk why. And then BAM! I discovered a FUCKING NEW ENTIRE WORLD EXISTS, the signs, the names, the stuff...  
  
Since then I've been reading/watching/learning about blue every time I have a free time, it's taking over control of my life. In 2021 I still was tricking my mind that I was seeing things related to blue just for a different reason, that I did not want blue in my life. I was just lying to myself. Things started to slowly change in 2022, then in 2023 it took control and I was all for blue. But sometimes I'm reluctant.  
  
And now it is fucking ruining my life. I don't know if she really wants blue or if I misinterpreted. But why did she say all those things? fuck my life. I'm going insane.  
  
Aftermath: I want to kms so this mess in my head will stop. This is not the only reason I'm currently suicidal, but this thing is taking. a HUGE toll on me.  
  
People who do blue of course encourage this. But when I read normal (i.e. vanilla) people talking about this, they're disgusted. Actually even people who do blue say this may have bad results. IDK WHAT TO DO. I CRY EVERYDAY AND THINK OF BLUE ALL THE TIME. I even started to hit my hands/arms every time I have a thought like this so this can stop, but I got to the point I started to get bruises, and sometimes my hands and arms are really sore.  
  
I really wish I could go back in time when I didn't know this was a thing.  
  
I am not saying this is this person fault. Please do not say anything bad about her, she is perfect. But the truth is the things she said and things that happened were triggers that led me to get to know blue and all this happened.",1713192447.0,

I’m making this post because I think I’m hoping for some sort of reassurance that I’m not a bad person . I’m going to try my best to explain how I feel so sorry if it doesn’t always make sense . 

I feel like I’m a horrible person who is always pretending to be something I’m not .even tho i know the way i act is true to myself somehow I always end up feeling like im lying. For example after a good day out with a girl for example I always come home and feel horrible that it went well. I feel like I’ve somehow lied to this girl and that she’s fallen for someone who im not , when the whole day I felt like I was speaking from a genuine place and actually had a really great time ,maybe some sort of self sabotage im not sure.  

Another issue I gave is making myself stressed by just giving myself reasons to hate myself .like again if im out on a walk on my own maybe listening to music because I’ve been in the house all day , I’ll get home feeling guilty about this walk and then when talking to my mum after and she asks where I go I feel like im lying when I tell her the truth of the route I took even tho it’s only round the neighbour hood as if im lying or something and actually went to get weed im not sure what I think I’ve done , the most recent example of this. Which has prompt led me to reach out is that I got with this girl at a party and we ended up getting intimate , not quite as far as sex but further than just making out , for some reason even tho I checked for consent frequently during and before what we did and asked if she was okay and we’ve talked since and she said she enjoyed it , and again got acknowledgement that I did check for consent and if she okay a lot I for some reason after this feel like a rapist or something, that I’ve done something horrible to this person when I’m reality it was a consensual and nice experience for us both . I have the image on my head of going into classes after the weekend and getting people staring at me and me being labelled a rapist, and a very heavy feeling n my chest like a constant state of worry . What is wrong with me why do I feel like this and how can I get help or find out what’s wrong with me if anyone has any similar feelings and may know it would be appreciated as I am tired of feeling like I’m the worst and that I’m a constant liar at and that everything I do is crime . It’s a horrible feeling and have felt shitty and bad for days and have even apologised for anything to the girl who has said that it’s unnecessary as I haven’t done anything wrong it’s getting to the point where I am feeling suicidal from constantly feeling completely and utterly shit and like a disappointment to my parents for what I’ve done but haven’t actually done",1713190098.0,

I am 24 (M) and I am currently staying in an Airbnb basement room in Toronto, Canada. For the past two years, I've been tirelessly searching for stable work since I graduated with a diploma in Broadcasting TV and Film. Unfortunately, I've only been able to land freelance projects, which do not cover my basic expenses like rent, food, phone bills, and transportation.

Thankfully I have a family in my home country that supports me. However I am tired of asking them for money to live in this expensive country and I feel like a loser everyday, not showing any positive results.

I apply to at least 15 jobs a day, and I get no response. My old clients don't contact me, (they don't have any projects). I am also contacting people on LinkedIn for career chat, thankfully I will have an in person meeting with an industry professional today, I am looking forward to that. 

My bank account in my home country got blocked and I cannot pay for a therapist. I only have about $200 dollars in my Canadian bank account to pay for food and bus tickets. 

I am tired of this situation. I apply everyday and I get no responses. I feel like I am worthless and I have no purpose in this world. I really want to get some help but I cannot afford it at the moment because I can only use the $200 dollars to survive here. 

I have a girlfriend and I feel I disappoint her for being unemployed and not a productive member of society. 

On top of everything, the living situation in my Airbnb is far from ideal. I also have misophonia and I feel uncomfortable where I am staying because my roommates are loud and inconsiderate, adding to my stress and discomfort. It's hard to find peace and focus in such an environment.

I think sometimes I suffer from derealization disorder. I think the world around me is not real, like I am watching a screen. I feel emotionally empty sometimes.

Ideally I would not have to be here. I would prefer to be in my home country with my own business. But the film and tv industry is not appreciated there. I have been contemplating going back to college and study something else that is in demand like computer science or web development. I just want to earn money, have my own place and not be a disappointment to my parents so much.

xeanrez,Why am I hallucinating and forgetting things?,1,1c4mkbp,0,"I (F20) have been diagnozed with depresseion, social anxiety and BPD a few years ago now. 

I go to therapy, I take meds and it is generally known that I am not mentally stable but it has gotten out of hand.

Since my new apprenticeship I am seeing shit. The hallucinations appear almost always when I am going home from work. It looks like looking through a collidoscope toy but make it colorless and transparent. Sometimes I see snow where I am looking and at other times white fireflies.

I did an MRT scan but there was nothing weird with my brain.

Also, I keep forgetting stuff. I KNOW that I fought for months to get away from my abusive parents but I can't for the life of me remember how I escaped in the end. It's as if I just spawned in my new home. 

I feel a mental wall and I tried to break it, but after concentrating on any memories it resulted in me remembering how a suicide prevention hotline hanged up on me. Since then I left this ""wall"" alone. I don't know what else is behind it but I feel PAIN seeping through.

I know true heartbreak can take someone to clinical depression, it did for me. I am doing better every day, still working through things. But I’m doing better.

I remember at the beginning of the pain, I really started diving into different mental well being practiced and studies. There was a point in time where I was really into breath work, meditation, learning about Buddhism (born Christian) and their ideals, stoicism, and a few more off the rail emotionally crazy concepts like the law of attraction, unrealistic affirmations, etc. I also read a ton of self help books. It felt like being so head deep into all these things kept me a float. 

Today, after a really, really long time, a lot of work, and a battle with ongoing depression, the days have gotten more normal, not as focused as doing everything to stay afloat.

I’m curious what beliefs, studies, or mental well being practices you all kept doing as the pain moved further away? What did you take a step back and realize you were a little bit in a manic phase? What are you still working on?

Qmeieriet,The modern society is creating a high anxiety condition.,5,1c4ev61,1,"We live in a society with high anxiety as a consequence of social media; body image, sex, and other social expectations pressure, and our primitive brain's need for anxiety as a defense mechanism.

Social media platforms are part of our lives, allowing constant access to sharing a variety of information. However, they also contribute to anxiety by creating a culture of comparison, where people constantly compare their lives, achievements, and looks. The idealized versions of others' lives often shown on social media can make us feel inadequate and anxious about our own lives.

Society puts pressure on physical appearance, sexuality, and social status. The pressure to conform to these standards can be overwhelming and cause anxiety. Unrealistic beauty standards, sexual expectations, and the pursuit of material success can create a constant sense of inadequacy and anxiety about fitting in or meeting societal expectations.

Our primitive brain developed to protect us from threats and ensure survival, making it naturally prone to experience anxiety. It constantly scans the environment for potential dangers and triggers the ""fight-flight-or-freeze"" response when it senses a threat. While this response was crucial for our ancestors' survival, in modern society, it can be easily triggered by various factors, such as: social pressures. This constant state of arousal can result in anxiety and contribute to high anxiety levels in society.

In short, social media, societal pressures, and our primitive brain's defense mechanism all contribute to the high anxiety levels in our society. Recognizing these factors and adopting strategies to manage anxiety, like mindfulness, self-care, and seeking support, can help us navigate the challenges of living in an anxiety-inducing environment.

I’ve been on about 10 medications over the years for major depression and anxiety. Over the last few years I realise I developed a bad habit of med switching. 

I have a bad habit over the years of messing with my meds. 

1. Stopped all my meds against the advice of my Psychiatrist and ended up crashing HARD. Won’t do that again that’s for sure!

2. Start a med and after a while decide it’s not working and either: Decide to adjust my dose either up or down: Decide it’s not working at all and get the Psych to change to something else

Recent swap:

Last year I said nothing was working and I want to try Effexor again because that was ok the first time I used it (2012). This is the third time on Effexor. I started in November and I’m on 225mg. 

First thing I noticed was when I wake up in the morning after having Largactil at night to sleep, I would be so drowsy all morning and sometimes a headache. Prior to the Effexor, Largactil was the 1st medication that I had been prescribed for my insomnia that didn’t cause daytime fatigue. 

Also after starting Effexor I began playing with my eyelashes. This is something I have done since childhood as a comfort. It had actually stopped with the other medication but didn’t realise till I started doing it again. 

It is compulsive. I was doing it so much, constantly all the time, it has got to the point I get conjunctivitis like symptoms of gross yellow stuff sticking in my eyes and all around my eyeline is red, swollen and painful. It requires drops and some cream on the skin. 

Since starting again I also ended up in a severe depressive state which would leave me motionless in bed not moving, staring at nothing with racing thoughts in my head the felt like they were so loud. After months of this I finally went to the Psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with Bipolar II.


Problem:

I want to come off the Effexor and go back on something else. I’m feeling like a Prozac is better. I have start with a new Psych as mine retired. I haven’t done this with him. While he has discussed with me and my original Psych about my history of symptoms and medications in order to confirm Bipolar II, he has only recently started me on Lamotrigine. 

I don’t know how to tell him I don’t want the Effexor. I need some outside input to sort through what I’m thinking and what/how to say it. 🙏

i-just-wanna-be-edgy,6 years and 3 diagnoses later...,2,1c4hi9x,1,"Good news, but also kind of a vent.

I receieved my first psychiatric evaluation at 16 from a therapist both my mom and I were seeing (separately). It was one of the 400 t/f questionnaires. With the results and multiple sessions, the therapist determined that I had major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety. 

Being a teenager was hard, and dealing with stuff at home, people at school, and bias from teachers made things... a lot harder. My insurance at the time didn't cover a psychiatrist, so I spoke with my PCP about anxiety and antidepressants. I was immediately dismissed as ""oviously bipolar"" and told she could not prescribe them or my moods would become ""drastically unstable."" I should note that I am AFAB, and in retrospect it felt very ""Yellow Wallpaper"" of her, but when you're 16, you listen to the doctors, especially when you want relief. 

The therapist lost his license when I turned 18, and around that time, I was finally able to find a psychatrist on my insurance as I was an adult. I was evaluated for around 15 minutes and prescribed my first antipsychotic. It went horribly, I was constantly depressed, I gained a lot of weight, and I was having spicy sad feelings. When I reported these symptoms to the psychiatrist, he consistently upped my dosage; in a period of 8 months, it had increased by 300%. It wasn't until I insisted that I switch that he changed me to another antipsychotic. We had appointments once a month, and each time, I would have a 5 minute phone call where he would ask me about the weather and how the medications were going. I was placed on 3 different antipsychotics before I got fed up with him constantly ignoring my concerns. Thankfully, my PCP had heard that he was not the best and understood.

When I turned 20, I was able to find a new therapist and received my second evaluation. This evaluation was more in depth and included an interview from a separate therapist (for evaluation purposes). I was diagnosed with bpd, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, and ptsd. I continued with my therapist until she left and voiced that I did not agree with the diagnosis. At the same time, I had been trying to get my pcp to remove bipolar disorder from my record, but she didn't believe me.

After my therapist left, I was placed with a new one who heavily led with my diagnosis instead of listening to my concerns. At one point she said ""why does this matter?"" I cried in the session, shut down, and changed therapists quickly atter. I started meeting with a new therapist at the same location, this one specialized, or at least frequently worked with those with bpd. After meeting for about a year, she asked me if I felt like I had bpd; we went over the criteria, discussed it in length. She notice inconsistencies in my previous evaluation and consulted with her supervisor, which resulted in me getting my final and most recent evaluation. 

I spent 4 hours meeting with a therapist for my evaluation and received a diagnosis of ADHD and PTSD. The bpd was removed. I was given a copy and able to provide physical evidence that I was not Bipolar, did not have BPD, and they were finally removed from my record. At first, I thought maybe I had tricked my therapist or my evaluators. That because my mom has bpd and because I don't want to be her that I had subconsciously manipulated them. Depsite my therapist, my friends with psychology degrees, and close family said they ""thought I knew"" I had ADHD, I was still working with the first evaluation results. It wasn't until I started taking ADHD medication that I realized that the diagnosis was correct. It's a relief, but also upsetting that it took 6 years to get this far.

Tl;dr: I was constantly misdiagnosed with mood disorders for years, dismissed by my health providers. I finally received a diagnosis of ADHD and the medication is going well. And no, I did not lose my sparkle. Misogyny and class prejudice is still incredibly prevalent within mental health care. We're all tired.

CloudyRiverMind,I feel like I am about to break.,1,1c4k91p,0,"I can't remember much lately. I even have dreams of waking up and hearing people talk only to be told that conversation never happened.

My anger is getting worse. If I'm not purposefully lashing out with words to try to hurt someone I'm ranting to myself about how everyone deserves to die.

I'm so numb otherwise. I go from book to book, game to game, show to show without enjoying anything.

Lately I've been masturbating twice a day at least. It's an annoying process because each time takes at least an hour. I can't seem to finish until it starts to hurt. It's the only thing that feels good anymore, yet only right at the end.

Today I didn't really do anything. I spent four hours masturbating. There's nothing else to do.

I can't hold a job because I start having panic attacks. If not from fear of them then from anger at how ignorant they are. How stupid and naive they are.

Each day I seem to find something to look forward to. The eclipse might be the end of the world, Russia might nuke us, civil war might start.

I am always dissapointed. Somstimes I imagine there's someone outside waiting for me, but I walk over and nothing is there. I know there isn't, but I still go see.

I never imagined living this long, but I can't seem to die. I've lost all drive towards it at this point. Hanging didn't work either, all it did was make me feel alive.

I wake each night (for I sleep each day), hoping the world ends, I die, or that someone gives me the push needed to beat them to death.

I lock my doors while asleep. I don't trust anyone not to come in. I barricade it too. My window is blocked off with junk.

I'm told I'm paranoid. I am, I know. What difference does it make? If I need the protection I'll have it and they won't.

I always carry a knife on me, even when sleeping.

I've stopped wondering if I'm dead or in hell. It doesn't matter. I've realized recently I've always been like this.

Soggy-Extent5671,How much frustration is too much?,1,1c4k2fb,6,"I can't fucking sit at a place (unless I'm using the phone), I keep pacing the house. Either I have to lie down or walk. No in between. How am I supposed to do anything? People keep recommending meditation but thinking and breathing go hand in hand. I can't exist without thinking. I swear my head will explode.The only time I can stop thinking is when I'm asleep. I can't be concious and not think.

I can't seem to focus on my studies. I'm honestly interested in so many things that I keep on going back and forth like a pendulum, unable to give full dedication to any of the tasks. I like writing but I can't seem to go beyond one sentence. When I tried to do journaling, I always had to cut the sentences halfway because I remember to add sth else. And when the page became full of cut and messy sentences, I'd have to give up since I can't bear the look of the page. I tried to write stories but no matter how many videos I watch to hear people telling me that the first draft doesn't have to be perfect, I just can't continue if I can't fix the previous sentence. With English being my second language adds acid to my already bubbling frustration. I used to like maths until I joined the new school (for 11th and 12th), I couldn't keep up with the teaching pace. My teacher was so fast and wouldn't go into details. While I'm used to thinking a lot and do things step by step. It's a habit I can't get rid of. I feel like I'll never be able to study higher maths because there's no place for slow and lazy people. Yet I try to give time and learn my own way but there's physics, then chem, then bio. So where's the time? I can't manage all of them. I love reading novels but refraining myself from them since I feel guilty to enjoy a story when I've a pile of academic books crushing me under their weight and a bunch of due exams pulling my nerves  (idk what to study so I'm giving all sorts of entrance exams). 

And the current political climate of my country is really so fucking bad. I can't see this rampant inequality, oppression and discrimination.

But I'm hopeless. I don't even know how to quickly read an analogue watch. I have to look at it for more than a minute since it's so hard to adjust the hands in my head then count by 5 mins until I can finally be sure of it. It's so embarrassing. Idk why I'm so concious of every step. 

If these aren't e-fucking-nough, my childhood SA memories come all the way to grab by my throat. And I end up imagining about all the possible ways I should've've spoken up for myself and thrown him into jail or see myself rescued by a saviour. Then there are my child abusing neighbours who'll hideously slap and beat their children and I can't do anything to save them (I see myself in them). Yes please kill me already with all this guilt.

This is a rant. Yes that's how incoherent my thoughts are. I start from personal frustrations to political and then come back to the realisation of how powerless I'm.

Not looking for any diagnosis but plz help me understand whatever is the matter with me. The older I get, the more these problems intensify. I think I'll just go to sleep before I pull out my skull. ",1713181299.0,
Echo_Enchantress,URGENT HELP NEEDED!!,1,1c4k1dn,1,"I’m going through a really tough breakup. Six years ago, I matched with a guy on Tinder who was serving in the military. We never actually met or had lengthy conversations. After two years of no contact, he suddenly reached out to me. Despite my initial reluctance, he persuaded me to meet him. When we finally met, he seemed genuinely interested in me and even brought up the topic of marriage. We quickly involved our families, and everything felt like true love to me, despite my lack of experience in such matters. After a few days, his anger issues began to surface. He would clench his teeth in anger, break things, and attribute it to frustration and negative conversations. He constantly reassured me that everything could be resolved and that he would never leave me, until one day he abruptly decided to leave and started ignoring me. Each time we spoke, he expressed his desire to be with me. I never imagined he would cause me so much pain. For about a month, he claimed he wanted to work on our issues but then would ignore me, lie to me, and mistreat me. Despite this, I held onto hope that things would improve, as he never mentioned leaving me. One day, I urgently requested to speak with him, expressing my frustration with his promises followed by ignorance. He admitted he couldn't continue and suggested we be friends. I was shocked, considering we had been discussing marriage. I pleaded with him not to say such things. He mentioned wanting to sleep and promised to call me the next day, but he never did. Since then, he hasn't reached out or responded to any of my messages. It's been three months now, and my emotional state hasn't improved. My mother, witnessing my suffering, attempted to reach out to him on my behalf. Although he returned her call, he failed to follow through on his promise to speak with me.

Some of this might sound stupid to some. I just want advice. I want to know what I could do to get rid of these problems/thoughts. I still have to go to the doctor to get diagnosed for whatever. I just need tips on how to calm the hell down. What could I do? 

Basically here are a few problems I have: 

-I (15f) tend to hallucinate. I don’t know why. I just hallucinate or have horrible thoughts and that really affects me and my daily activities. My brain will come up with the most horrifying thoughts and I’ll be scared shitless. Sometimes I’ll just be walking around like nothing and then I’ll see a shadow (Guess you can call it that) of a person crawling on the floor. I will be trying to sleep but then I’ll see shadows around me and the sound of someone breathing. I will be trying to sleep but then I’ll hear someone walking around outside. My brain makes up these noises and it terrifies me. 

-I’m too paranoid. I always feel like crap at school. I am walking around and when people laugh I think they’re laughing at me. If people stare, I get horrified. If someone is behind me, I feel like they’re following me. If someone behind me has their phone out, I feel like they are recording me. I feel like many people are planning something against me. I feel like I’m always being followed and watched. I sometimes worry that someone will break in my house so I sleep with a knife. 

-I don’t get enough sleep. I try but I just can’t. I’m tired but I can’t sleep. 

-Sometimes I just want to scream and cry.

-My lack of motivation. I just don’t have motivation to do anything. I want to do something fun but the motivation loss is like an anchor. It’s holding me down and it really pisses me off.",1713166050.0,

 I have been raped by my older siblings dad, and still remember what happened. I won't talk about it much, but he used my mouth for he's own sick pleasure. Idk if that counts as rape (I'm saying this because others have told me it doesn't). I have been touched without my concent for a total of 4 times all when I was younger. some where in school, some where out when I was being babysat. I'm now a sophomore in highschool, everything hasn't been okay at all since that all has happened.

I have told my mother, and my older sibling, and my aunt and my cousin, all about this. I told my mother and older sibling this twice. The first time, I don't think they heard me, or perhaps I was dreaming, I don't really remember now. But the second time I told them, I was hurting, by just remembering it all again. My mother told me, she couldn't do anything about it. She told me I couldn't get therapy, even though I think I do now. She told me she would go to jail, if she said anything. I still don't understand why, I know I can't tell the school shit. And even if I want to go to a therapist, I don't have money, and I doubt my mother will help me.

She had told me that she was also raped, but she didn't get to go to therapy either so why should I? (Not her words, but it felt like that's what she was telling me) she tells me I need to be strong. But in all honesty, I am not. Not at all. I'm just merely trying to live for as long as possible, even if there's nothing worth living for.

And for my older sibling, I don't think she remembers the conversation we had anymore, and it isn't her fault. I won't explain my older siblings condition since I don't feel comfortable doing that. But when she did know, she would still talk and go to her dad's house. I don't know what I was expecting, I guess I was hoping she would stop talking to him?? I was hoping with this ""new"" information they all would be mad at him, that's the least they could do for what that man did to me. But they didn't. They continued on, like nothing was wrong.

So. I had to stay in the car, stay in the bathroom, stay in my room until that man was gone, because I was so fuckin disgusted whenever I heard he's voice. I was disgusted when my older sibling gave me some soda that her dad brought for her, so she gave it to me.

One time a month later after the talk. My mother and I had to attend a school meeting. (Because I was still a freshman and I wasn't going to school at all. I have a lot of trouble with going to school, and I don't know why.. but we will discuss that topic another time.) In the meeting one of the ladies noticed something about me that made her ask me. ""Do you have trouble taking showers?"". I said yes, because I do. She then asked ""Do you feel like you absolutely can go to school but whenever you try and actually go, you just can't?"" And I said yes.

I was shocked how she understood that feeling. And then she asked if I was ever raped. Now in this whole time, my mother was answering my questions for me in which got the lady mad or more so annoyed, so when she asked that question, she told my mom not to answer that for me. And to my mom's disappointed, I  said yes.

The room got quiet, and they went on to question me, talking me outside to talk with a male teacher. In the end. It was all useless. I said what happened, I answered all their questions, and they couldn't give me the closure or answers to my questions. And I left with my mom. In the car, I was almost ready to burst in tears, staring at the floor just blankly.

Here are some things I have questions about, considering this topic. Is this actually hurting me mentally? (I know that at one point something inside me snap that was related to the rape and that's when I stopped taking care of my hygiene)

What is wrong with me? How can I stop remembering this?  How can I heal?  What can I do?

One of the two arguments was about me taking a guy's number at work. Instead of telling the guy no, I felt too guilty turning him down that I just went along with it. I am too much of a people pleaser and doormat in these types of situations. 

Another instance just happened today when my manager asked me to use my car to go to the gas station. I obviously didnt want to say yes, but somehow I just brushed him off instead of just telling him no.

Silver_Assistance_25,How do I mitigate my fear that my sister might be relapsing ?,2,1c4f6ic,1,"
My(24f) older sister had struggled with a serious drug addiction when I was a teenager. She almost died, she was in the hospital for two weeks, in and out of rehab for three years. She got sober when I was around 15. About a year ago I found out she had relapsed three years ago and never told me. She said it was a one time thing and worked with her sponsor about it. Since then she has been sober. 

Recently she has gone through a really hard break up. They’ve been together for years and live together and she’s having a hard time finding a new place to live. On top of that about three weeks ago we went to see my dad for the first time in years together (a very triggering relationship for me and I assume her) all while this was going on for her. 

Since the trip she hasn’t reached out to me. I called her last week and she didn’t pick up. Normally when she doesn’t pick up she will text me being like “hey can I call you tomorrow”, but there was nothing. Then called her today again and she didn’t pick up so I texted her and just said “hey give me a call back when you can.” She called me back later tonight but she just seemed a bit out of it. Still herself but I could tell she wasn’t really paying attention to what I was saying, granted it’s late and she might have been tired. I told her she seems out of it and she said she was going through a lot, which is understandable with her breakup and moving. 

I can’t help but fear she might be relapsing. All today I was so triggered, going back to that emotional place when she almost died. I couldn’t stop crying at work and imaging what it would be like if she died. All over her not picking up her phone. I’m terrified of losing her and I know there’s nothing I can do about it. How can I stop getting so worked up about, especially when I have no concrete evidence that she is relapsing? Thanks!

Abject-Nectarine5276,please help me,1,1c4iasv,4,"Hello. I am making this post because my mental health is at an all time low and I need any help I can get right now, whether its just listening, sympathizing or helping me, I will appreciate it.

About me: I am a 14 year old Australian male who is in the second term (10 weeks of school) of year 10. I have a small job in which I work about 10 hours a week and I also run a clothing brand in which I hope to grow into my main source of income. (haven't made any sales yet)

My problem: I am, and have been for a few months now, at an all time low. I am never happy about anything, I get aggravated very easily, i have minimum of three restless nights per week, a 2 week holiday just ended and I left my room less times than the amount of fingers on my hands, and I am slowly concluding towards the solution being suicide. I truly think that if I wasn't scared of the pain, I would've done it by now.

I don't even know where to start. My social life is a mess. I have been hanging out with the same group of about 4 people for most of the duration of high school. (about 3 years) At one point, I saw them as my best friends, but slowly overtime I came to realize that they are dropkicks. They are everything I don't want to be. They don't leave their game consoles unless its to hit the vape shop or smoke cones. I have tried vaping, weed and cigarettes and I consistently vaped for about a year and smoked weed for about 3 months until I went all healthy. ( ill get into this later) This is what made me realize they weren't the right people for me. I saw myself as superior to them just because I had the ability to quit drugs before they even had the idea of it. I slowly started hating them more and more every day but never actually showed it, or left them for a new group of friends. Then one day, out of the blue, they all ditched me. This happened about 3 weeks before the holidays so about 6 weeks ago. We all used to sit at the basketball courts along with about 200 other students every lunch time/recess. Now without them, I am the only one sitting by myself. I know people see me as a loner, or a loser now and obviously I don't like it. It makes me quite insecure but I choose to do nothing about it. I don't sit with someone else, I don't make new friends, I just sit all alone every recess for everyday. I had a girlfriend. I have had multiple in the past but they weren't real relationships. We would text each other but completely avoid each other at all cost irl. But this girl, ill called her EL, was the first girl I actually spoke too whilst dating. We went on multiple dates, and we were each others first kiss. I think I might have commitment issues or something because as soon as EL mentioned our anniversary, I started to subconsciously point out every little flaw about her and made up my mind to break up with her. About 1 week later, I deeply regretted it, realizing I literally searched for a reason to break up with her.  What the fuck is wrong with me? I miss her, and think about her every late night but don't text her because she moved on and got a new boyfriend really fast. 

My health is pretty bad right now. I got caught vaping once and my mum searched my room and found weed. My parents are divorced btw. She said she wouldn't tell my dad since he is already on my back about the vaping and all this happening really showed me that I was on the path to being a disappointment. So I stopped everything drug related, cut out social media, and refined sugars from my diet and went to gym for 2 hours a day, 6 days a week. My diet was the hardest thing, staying loyal to my no sugar rule was easy but hitting the macros was impossible considering I had to ingest about 2400 calories and my daily intake was probably like 1000 before I started all that. I trained calisthenics, hoping one day to be one of those super athletes doing muscle ups and planches but after a whole year of consistent workouts with minimal progress, it really harmed my motivation. And i quit, then i broke my hand, giving me all the more reasons to stay quitted (if that's a word) From then, i just went into a downwards spiral, eating shit, less exercise, more video games, back to social media, and during all of this since i was about 11, i have been fighting a massive porn addiction. Now I'm here, leaving my room less than once a day unless its for work or school, diet consisting of like 60% junk food, drinking like 200ml of water a day and now I'm the deepest in my addiction than i have ever been. I did at one point resort to staying high, as much as possible but on my first time back on weed, i had a full blown panic attack and never did it again. I have minimum 3 sleepless nights a week, and I'm overloading myself with melatonin every night which doesn't help, just makes me nauseous the next day.

A reoccurring theme in my life is to get bored. I have experienced a low mood for months when i was about 12 and it rooted from life being boring and repetitive. Wake up, get ready, go to school, get bored shitless, come home, eat, sleep, repeat. When i started working out (at 13yrs old) it added a difference to my life. it was the one thing i looked forward to every day. Then that got boring after a year. Then i got a job, and currently that is the only enjoyable thing in my life right now. Its the only social interaction i get. I love the customers, the managers, the co-workers and I'm good at my job. I work at a restaurant serving food, cleaning tables, taking orders and much more. School or any education at all is the most repetitive thing to me. I used to look forward to my future. I wanted to go to uni and become a physiotherapist but now i despise the idea of uni with all my heart and hope to drop out before finishing school.

With all this shit ruining my mental health, i hate myself even more for even letting it get to me. My thought process is ""Who the fuck am i to be sad? People go through way harder shit then me and are happier. War veterans, orphans, cancer patients. I'm so selfish for thinking i need help, love and support to get over my SaDnEsS when people are suffering real problems and real depression for real reasons."" I could literally not name one thing positive about myself. Every motivational quote i hear make me hate myself even more. For example ""Would you accept a billion dollars if it meant you wouldn't wake up tomorrow?"" ""No"" ""So treat your life like its worth more than that"" But then i think to myself that its bullshit. I am worth nothing so why would i not accept that? At least then will i be worth something, and have somethin to leave behind to my family.

If you read this far, i cant thankyou enough. You took your time out of your day just to read a random kids feeling for no personal gain, so again thankyou. Any comments will be greatly appreciated no matter what it is you have to say.",1713174768.0,
Apollo______________,How do I help a friend with bipolar disorder without making them feel as if its a hinderance?,1,1c4i9ko,0,"I have had my experience with depression, and when I used to go to therapy sessions I wasn't a big fan of how they would talk to me. It made me feel special in a way that I didn't want to feel, as if I was a problem. 

Now I have a very good friend who has mentioned she has bipolar disorder, she does not seek medical care for it. As it is not that severe, I have done my research and she barely has manic episodes but rather a lot more depressive ones. I have a special place in my heart for her and I really want to help her. She sometimes feels as if nobody is there for her or that nobody cares for her. More recently she has mentioned that the amount of care I give her, is an amount she has never experienced and is confused with it. It is the most genuine care I have ever given to anybody and I believe she deserves the world. She also admitted feelings for me a while back (I have feelings for her too), I do not know how she feels now but I still want the best for her.

How do I give her assistance with this, without making her feel as if she is not normal in a bad way. I don't know how to word it properly.

Thank you so much",1713174628.0,
Qmeieriet,Anxiety and excitement share the same biological responses.,2,1c4evhw,1,"When you get ""anxious"" also now referred to as ""excited"":

Your hormones shoot up Adrenaline (Epinephrine) which increase your heart rate and alertness. It also shoots up cortisol, which is a stress hormone that is associated with energy.

**The physiological effect:**

* increased heart rate (more blood flowing through your body to provide nutrients).
* increased respiratory rate (rapid breathing to further take in o2 and remove Co2, this also provide more resources to your body).
* sweating (your body cools down to prevent over-heating).
* pupils dilate (this effect makes your eyes taking in more light, which translates to: more visual information and alertness)
* muscle tension (prepares the muscle for physical response)

I can go into deep detail about this, but I'll briefly touch on the neurological response as that get's technical quickly:

* norepinephrine spikes (increased alertness)
* dopamine spikes (pleasure and excitement chemical (neurotransmitter))
* serotonin spike (associated with mood and anxiety regulation)
* gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (another neurotrans that helps with brain activity and can affect anxiety levels (note: GABA is what anxiety medications, such as: Benzodiazepines act on (I highly advise you to avoid BZO though))

**Conclusion:**

Anxiety and excitement are similar as both emotions trigger an increased physiological response (as mentioned above), the key difference between feeling anxious and excited is that you associate the feeling with something threatening or that it might lead to negative outcomes, but you can turn that around and start associating it with desirable events, creating a sense of thrill and anticipation.

Anxiety and excitement is the same emotion, but your association to it determines if it's bad or good. Now every time you get anxious: slowly breath in deeply with your nose, and exhale through your mouth (really fill and empty your lungs) 4-5 times - this trigger your vagus nerve to relax which further calms you down from the high intensity emotion, once calm try getting to know the excitement sensation, learning to be able to stand in it will give you a huge advantage.

I work drastically better in high intensity stress situations, throw me at someone needing EMS treatment and is in critical condition; I feel calm; focused; and content - and the same goes for martial arts, you need to be able to handle high intensity; it's your brain and body preparing you to react to the situation.

[The modern society is creating a high anxiety condition.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/s/jyMvo1ersX)

[Anxiety is a spiral; it causes you psychosomatic symptoms (usually in the form of something the person is prone to worry about); which increases the anxiety due to the presence of symptoms/sensations; which increases the symptoms/sensation; and around you go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/s/gYdAKJw0EJ)",1713160676.0,

Character-Job9602,very scared of schizophrenia,1,1c4hu3f,7,"hi! i’ve been afraid of schizophrenia for some time now. One day it’s better and I don’t think about it at all and other days I just want to cry because I’m so afraid of the unknown. Basically I don’t have any predispositions to develop it,but a few months back I randomly started reading about it and got so scared that I’ve been reading a lot about symptoms,types of hallucinations and facts about it. It made me monitor every thought I had,any movement in my peripheral vision too (though it was always just something that was already there or just someone/something actually moving). It basically became an obsession I guess since I started seeking reassurance basically every day and checked the symptoms over and over again even though I knew them. I looked for reddit posts about it where people were very helpful and it made me calmer but then I think I actually got some auditory hallucinations? Either way they were like the doom of me. Not long ago I was in my bathroom just brushing my teeth and I heard very clearly a notification from my phone-went to check it and there was nothing (not only that,my phone was on silent mode). Then when I was in the bathroom again,closed door just preparing for bed I thought I heard my mom say something to me but she didn’t. I guess it makes sense since when I’m in the bathroom she tends to say something to me sometimes and I’m afraid I might not hear her and it was like the 3rd time? this happened ever since I was a kid (just kind of being alert about it). I’m sorry if it’s a long post but I am just afraid every day and I’ve really had enough of it. I want to get better. I don’t want to be scared anymore but those hallucinations (I guess) really keep me from it. Everything else is fine,only sometimes when I’m walking with my dog at night I’m a little scared if I see a guy and we’re alone on a street (yk just woman things haha). But every time I get a weird thought (and sometimes I get intrusive ones) I tend to get scared it might be a delusion too (though I know it’s not since I do t believe it,just makes me uneasy sometimes). I tried to list everything I could,but please,from the bottom of my heart. If you have any suggestions, any friends/close ones who sadly suffer from schizophrenia please tell me if it sounds like I could have it? I already know it’s pretty rare,but as you can see I really need any reassurance I can get. Maybe someone is going through something similar? I’m working on going to a therapist by the way! So anything you want to say is welcome. Thank you in advance and sorry if the post is kinda messy!",1713172874.0,

something happened today brief description : ( basically something I was overthinking something 'bad' that I did and that I would get caught, and it came true and ever since I saw the look on their face from the action I did I felt sick to my stomach)

 and ever since then I feel out of place and something changed in my perspective, in my surroundings, every little actions I normally do on a daily basis feels different, like going on my phone, laying down and listening to music.

 and ever since then my conversations I usually have with the people I know are different, I'm actually paying attention to what they're saying and their facial expressions?

Next_Bottle_7362,I don’t feel stress until it’s panic attack level,5,1c4a3wo,1,"For some reason I always have this mindset of “everything will be okay, just go with the flow of life. Nothing will ruin your life. You’ll be fine” and I just don’t feel stress. I think a lot of situations are made to be stressful when in reality you’ll be just fine. For example, people get so frustrated over traffic. It’s fine. We aren’t in a rush. Another example, but bigger. The car broke down and we are stranded here until someone can pick us up and give us a ride home. It’s fine, it’s sorted out, we will be fine. That may be healthy,but then there’s this- another example. I had a foster sister. She was my friend before that for about a year. Then her grandma died and she needed a home. My mom took her in and she lived with us for about 5 years, being our sister. Long story short, she and my mom ended up not getting along at all and she ended up leaving. That didn’t affect me at all. I was like “oh, okay.” No disagreement, didn’t and don’t miss her, don’t care. I just don’t care. I also just don’t feel stressed at all about so many other things. That is, until it’s so overbearing I’m hyperventilating. I’ve been kind of known for my calmness and nonchalant style. But when I do get stressed, I’m a wreck. I just get a bad anxiety or even panic attack. I don’t know what this is or if it means anything. 

Also, I do have anxiety and depression. Anxiety does not feel the same as stress to me. I’m not worried about what the next thing may be. I’m worried about just other people. Not life in general. Basically just social and separation anxiety.

In February I ran away with the help of a ""friend"" to get to a mental facility in the closest children's hospital. I went because of suicidal thoughts and recent self harm, and I wasn't sure if I'd make it to the next day or so. My parents tracked me down and just... the confrontation and atmosphere was absolutely fucking terrifying. Having to get blood drawn there is now keeping me from being able to again. I think the only time I'll be able to is when it's absolutely medically necessary and/or when I can start T. Other than that I get flashbacks any time it's brought up. Fortunately, the person who drove me is no longer part of my life. And, fun fact, their family has essentially kidnapped/abducted other people, including my partner.

I get flashbacks of the whole stay (5 days I think) almost every night and I don't know what the fuck to do. I talked to my psychiatrist and she increased my dose by 5ml, but I still get the flashbacks and bad dreams which luckily isn't as frequent. 

I think about it all the time, I get constant reminders of it. I just feel trapped. Not to mention I've recently been dealing with what could easily be considered sexual harassment by another ""friend"" at school. And not even two weeks ago my dad started an argument over something small that was causing me to feel dysphoric and stormed out of the house.

I personally “peaked” in middle school which is sad to say, i had everything ive ever wanted and had happiness I couldn’t even comprehend holding today. I feel like I’ve lost it all and my personal spark to wonder what life would feel like if I stayed here another year (which I feel like I’d waste away until I get to my senior year.) I know I’m still a kid and I should just focus on the good times life is blessing me with but I just feel like there’s this part of me that’s saying I should go now, like my time is up. I’ve lost everything and I don’t know where to go since I say one day it’ll get better but those days have now turned into years; 3 years. Throughout those three years, I’ve thought about the same things, why can’t I have the love I was once surrounded with, why do people now see me differently and no longer find interest in me, and why can’t I become happy when life gives me the option to grow? I wonder how useless life is considering your name won’t even be mentioned years after I pass. People would be sad, but I’d feel like I’m accomplishing what I’ve thought was right, but I don’t want a permanent solution to a temporary problem but death doesn’t seem to be a burden anymore. I’m talking all around in this writing but I can’t even seem to think straight to express how I wanna die, like it already feels meaningless to confess it since it’s been on my mind so often that it almost seems convenient. 

I just wish I had my spark again, my friends again, the love from my family and peers but it all left me faster than I could even get to high school. I feel as if my life has no more storyline to it and my chapter is done, like I’m one of the short books in a library and wasn’t gifted with more pages to my chapters. Maybe I’m just in a bad place with no motivation to climb out of a hole that I’ve gotten into, I know if I was back to a place where I felt like I fit in, I could recover and put this mess behind me. It’s been three years since I’ve felt like this, 3 years is a long time for someone of my age, like I’ve felt this for a long time. 

In my stand point, I just wanna be happy. I know all the reasons I’m not sparked but even if I think about them, I’d get lost in this over stimulation of emotion to where I shut down and give up. I feel like I’ve failed everyone down to the core and they all see it as “who I am” which is always the title I’ve given when I mess up, “it’s just who you are.” I’ve lived my life from elementary to middle as this well known kid with a friend on every corner to talk to but now I feel like there’s no one in my field when I know there’s someone out there around me who actually cares. I like to think I’ll get over it, but I end up waiting and wasting my time away with smoking or something of the sort. I feel like a dirty kid who became a quiet person that’s hard to get along with since it felt so easy for everyone to move on from me. I understand I sound selfish like I deserve more than gods given me, but 3 years just to rot away and grow older is something I can no longer hold in my mindset.

Idontcarelolll,Think I’m losing myself,1,1c4h5uj,0,"I (18m) have been struggling more than I ever had in the past and I can’t seem to break the cycle.

For a brief background, I smoked weed a lot when I was 14-16, then stopped and started vaping consistently and drinking on weekends and sometimes casually (16-early 18).  

Now, I have quit vaping but in turn I have started to gamble (I’ve lost over a 1000$ in 2 months) , and  I’ve began to drink more often (4-5 times a week, 3 causally, 1-2 more intensely), I have also started to be more risky with driving, and picked up a caffeine addiction too. 

I am in three university classes and have difficulty doing the little amount of work I have to do, (mainly extensive papers). I sometimes but rarely will use friends adhd meds to help me finish something in a timely way

I have a gf who treats me amazing yet sometimes I am just so damn irritable. She does so much for me and I feel like I don’t treat her good enough. My sex drive has been low as well.

The only thing that I truly enjoy in live is skateboarding which I’ve done for over 10 years. It’s the only thing I consider to be healthy that I want to do. 

I have extreme boredom every night unless I am drinking, gambling, or eating something unhealthy. I am very aware of these behaviours which make me feel so guilty every single time I do them, especially gambling. 

It feels like I am head over heels addicted to dopamine and I don’t know what to do.  I enjoy learning about interesting political concepts and ideas , but my motivation in school is blocked because I feel like a bachelor degree will get me no where, additionally I can barely write a paper without procrastinating like crazy

icollectsquish,Please help me figure this out,1,1c4gzqa,2,"For as long as I can remember, I’ve always changed things so quickly…

Hobbies, style, usernames, literally everything.

One day I want to be this or that, the next, I change things up completely. I did just get diagnosed with OCD not too long ago, but I’m not sure if this problem is because of that, or if it is something else entirely. Could I have a mental illness aside from OCD, or could this be OCD? Ugh, it’s just confusing. I just really want to know what the heck is going on so I can work on this.

Here is an example:

One day I decided I was going to go to college for something and then the next day I decided I was going to do something else that was not going to benefit me in any way. A few hours after that, I decided I was going to shave my head. I don’t really know how to explain it in a way that makes complete sense. Am I just an impulsive person? Could this be OCD? Is this normal?

It is starting to take a major toll on me because I have no freaking clue who I am, what I like, what I want to do, what I want to wear. I feel as if I’ve created many versions of myself. I don’t know. I guess I just would like to know if I should be worried.

This part kind of worries me though:

One evening I told myself I was going to do something to help make my life better, and within an hour, I told myself I was going to do the exact opposite of that and do something very dangerous, something that would permanently alter my life in a negative way.

Is this normal? Is this just a part of growing up and finding yourself, or is something wrong mentally?

I am sorry if I’m not articulating this properly. I struggle with wording things and getting out what I’m specifically trying to say. Hopefully someone understands what I’m trying to say.

I’m sure people might say to go to therapy or to ask a psychiatrist or something, but Reddit is the only thing I’ve got right now. I am sure my questions are better for a mental health professional to answer, but I can’t exactly ask because I don’t currently see a mental health professional.

Hey guys, I’m going to keep this sort and sweet. 

My brother was betrayed by an old friend of ours who is very nasty, the friend he got with his ex girlfriend after telling him he wouldn’t, my brother told him many times that it was not okay. We went to Australia and he then decided to start making moves.

Anyway, my brother had a pretty heavy reaction to this, sent him some messages saying he is a bad guy etc and in turn tried to make other people dislike the ex friend. Which didn’t work so much. 

The ex friend on occasion followed him home threatening him. He also spat at him on nights out and also shouted from car windows. All pretty shit stuff to happen to someone.

My brother cannot get over this betrayal and is still extremely angry and in pain! It has affected his mental health, relationships and ability to express himself confidently. It’s tough to see, especially because he is a fundamentally good person with lots to offer. 

I really want him to find this closure, realise this anger and move on! 

Btw I don’t think we can talk to the ex friend as he’s pretty immature and it’s still painting a false story about the whole ordeal. 

There’s heaps of little details etc but I don’t want to exhaust you. 

What can I do to help?! What can he do to move past it for good?!

Let me preface this by saying I’ve not had an easy life, as a child, I’m now mid 30s with children of my own, who I adore and want to get better for them. 

Quick backstory - Daddy issues, never met him, never will, his choice. 

A few years ago it was cocaine and alcohol, then a suicide attempt after the delusions got so bad. 
Dr prescribed sleeping pills, which helped somewhat, I guess. 

Nowadays I drink to excess and have been “lucky” enough to be prescribed Codeine for back pain, which I abuse. I love the “warm blanket” feeling that I get, and the sense of numbness. 

My partner keeps saying “please stop drinking so much”, I promise I’ll try harder, but I can’t seem to stop. 

I’ve tried therapy, it was ok, but it’s hard talking about your deep set issues and feelings. 

I take a few “proper” meds already, Propalanol for panic attacks, Prozac for the depression. 
Is there something I can take to stave off the reliance on booze and codeine? 

Do I need an antipsychotic? 

Sorry this is so rambling 😩

Tldr: Need advice about which meds will make me feel more normal and balanced

Jidouhanbaikisan,"The kids are gone, my story. ",47,1c3qlaz,31,"I want to share my story, hoping it makes me feel better in this hopeless situation.

In 2015, I married a Japanese woman while living in Japan. I actually met her through her mother, whom I'd known from work a year before she introduced me to her daughter. We got along pretty well and married soon after. A year later, our first son was born, and we continued to live in Japan until the end of 2018, after which we moved to Germany. She believed it would be better for our child to grow up in Germany, as she was convinced Germany had a better education and health system. By that time, my career was going very well in Tokyo, but I gave it up for her and our child. Fast forward to 2022—my second and third child were born in Germany. The times were rough during and after the pandemic; my wife was very unhappy. I was self-employed, but we had a good life, I thought—big house, new furniture, everything. But she wanted to move away, somewhere else. Why not to Romania to open a small café?

... Maybe it was also my fault? I always said yes to everything, always tried my best to make her and the children happy, and I never hesitated too much from moving and restarting life.

So in April 2022, we sold everything and moved to Romania. I took a bank loan since she convinced me that it was going to be a success, and I wanted it to be good—a café with an authentic Japanese look. We opened a few months later and it was an instant ""success""—we always had customers, we didn't make much money, but it was nice. It's September 2023, and guess what? Well, she wants to move back to Japan! I found out while she was there for a holiday that she had secretly divorced me, and by November 2023, she and the kids were gone. She said, ""You can come to Japan when you're done closing the café. We can start a new life in Japan."" I was pretty upset... not furious, but very hurt. My heart is broken. I closed the shop since, why should I run it alone? I don't want to be alone in Romania?! So I started selling everything again...leaving another life behind me.

I moved back to Germany, to my parents' house. And here I am, five months later. Hopeless, sad, with no possessions and a loan I need to pay back. I still had much contact with my ex-wife and the kids, but it got less to the point where my messages are being ignored. I don't even know if my children are doing fine. I can't go to Japan since I'm struggling to pay off my debt.

And then I suddenly remembered—after an ugly argument with my mother-in-law a few years ago, she said that she didn't think her daughter and I would stay together for long. It actually was her plan to get her daughter pregnant by a foreigner to get a mixed grandchild. I now think that everything, the past 10-11 years, was just a farce. Now she got what she wanted: three mixed grandchildren. Her daughter is back in Japan, and I'm gone.

Well, this was my story. I'm not feeling much better after writing it; I don't feel very much anyway at the moment. I just hope it gets better, and I can move on.

Edit: I didn’t expect so many kind words and advice; it actually helped me feel better to share this with everyone here! I want to thank you all! ",1713091101.0,

Qmeieriet,Anxiety is a spiral; it causes you psychosomatic symptoms (usually in the form of something the person is prone to worry about); which increases the anxiety due to the presence of symptoms/sensations; which increases the symptoms/sensation; and around you go.,1,1c4eyma,0,"You don't have to feel ""anxious” either for these symptoms to arise. Anxiety is a disorder that can come in many shapes and sizes, the symptoms and intensities will vary. However, the most commonly associated sensation is ""uncontrollable worrying"" and ""distress"", but a lot of people get the wrong idea that this means a conscious sensation. 
  
Anxiety (and related conditions) usually manifest themselves sub-consciously and cause bodily symptoms, e.g: breathing difficulties; chest discomfort/pain (that can mimic the sensation you'd expect from heart failure); numbness (static) sensation in the extremities (hands/feet); and dizziness/light-headedness/confusion.
  
I've explained anxiety and panic related conditions to a lot of people over the years, and the most frequent symptom (or sensation) people report is psychosomatic (somatic conditions being ruled out by medical tests) symptoms relating to their worry/distress, e.g: chest pain (which is arguably the most common symptom due to a fear of a heart related condition).
  
When you experience the symptoms/sensations: try inhaling slowly and fully (fill your lungs) through your nose, exhaling slowly and completely (empty your lungs) through your mouth, repeat 7-8 times. This breathing technique usually helps you calm down and can alleviate anxiety and a range of other psychological and emotional conditions (it will require some practice).

He doesn't understand my autism and had made no attempts to see the struggles it causes. Especially for burnout and exacerbating ocd flares

I know on the surface it's a good thing but in practice it becomes draining and depressing. My Dad used to drink and smoke alot but now never does drinking nor smoking. He may have the casual beer after a hard day of work but it's only one.

Now he spends his free time watching ""self improvement"" videos with people like Jocko Willinks and Tony Robbins and James Clear (Atomic Habits). Holding what they say is true due to hearing it from other successful people who made alot of money. He Believes in self discipline and ""happiness is in the mind"" type mindsets. He told me today to ""get out of my comfort zone"" and push yourself because ""I'm not even trying"".

For a while I did so too. I pushed myself alot trying to get a degree in computer science and then working full time in retail during summer breaks. But the anger and mental torment I got from pushing myself wore me down. Plus I had a streak of bad luck with prof teachers and was constantly stressed about passing 24/7. Ontop of that I had lazy roommates who were passive aggressive and touched my stuff while I was gone. I knew I should have said something bug I felt like there would be tension and I had enough of it.

Chronically anxious made me depress and it caused me severe burnout. I felt drained and dragging my feet trying to finish classes. I was mad and pissed off at the unfair circumstances I was in.

The work I did at the moment made no impact because now I have moved back in with my Dad who is a severe workaholic and is Disappointed by my lack of effort to even get out of bed at a reasonable time. I wake up so sad and I feel like he never understands why I'm so pessimistic.

I live in Canada where the economy is in shambles and buying a house seems like a ""pie I the sky"" sort of deal. I want to have goals but the OCD and depression make each day a drain as I wake up and do stuff then immediately feel like sleeping again.

I have a psychiatrist but they don't understand ocd and just hope the pills will work. I'm on 100 mg of zoloft, 50mg of regular seroquel in the day, 100mg of seroquel xr at night and 1mg of klonopin daily.

I try to help my Dad but then he always ""moves the goal post"" and gives criticism to my flaws then acknowledging all the work I do for him. Like yesterday I helped him out in the yard for 4 hours. But today I had to do homework so he complains I didn't help him at all today and ignores yesterday. Never grateful for what I do to help him.

He yells alot and ""tells me to fuck off"" which he says he doesn't mean it after. But it hurts when he yells and keeps going off. I even don't like bringing stuff up as he goes on and on about stuff. Good or bad. He just talks my ear off. If I don't do what he says and give him reasons he sees them as excuse and yells at me. Even him saying he's ""talking nicely"" is condensing and is out to judge me and make me feel guilty.

Just tonight I asked if I could quickly brush my teeth and he told me to ""fuck off"" because I was using up his time. He has only an hour of free time before going to bed and can't waste five minutes to let me brush my teeth as I get too tires after watching the show. So he yells and makes me feel bad. He doesn't even stay up the whole time we were watching the show so that's annoying.

I try to love him but his working attitude is insane. He goes to bed at 12am and wakes uo around 4am to either go to work which is an hour drive there and an hour drive back. Or he's doing paperwork. He complains that he hates it but ""life is 80 percent bullshit and 20 percent fun"". Which makes me even more pessimistic. I feel tired just listening to him about it. Even other topics as he goes on and on talking. Just doesn't know when to shut up.

My mom is not better. If I miss a day of my retail job due to ocd flare she tells me to ""suck it up and go to work"". She's a whole new can of worms but both have done their part to ruin my development.

Anyways that's my rant. Does anyone have similar parents? What have you done in terms of burnout and ocd? I take supplements Like Ashwagandha, L-theanine, gaba, magnesium bisglycinate, and 5-http.

I have read a bit of atomic habits and the daily stoic 366 meditations by Ryan Holiday. Please any advice would be helpful. Thanks and have a good day

So growing up as an Indian American who comes from an immigrant family, I always had a hard time fitting in especially in school. I was “special ed” during my grade school which infuriated me more, because I don’t want to be seen as dumb. I was a quiet kid in school and never spoke to anyone, and because of that I used to get picked on and teased by the “loud people” in school. I wanted to be friends with the smart Indian/South Asian girls, but I always felt left out.  
In 6/7th grade I befriended this Pakistani girl whom was nice to me and I thought she was my friend.. We spoke about things like school and bullies etc during PE class when we would have the jogging/walking warm ups. I used to succumb to her because I just didn’t want to feel isolated during PE class, because thats when the bullies would prey upon me. But in 8th grade she got “popular” she got her own group of friends and I tried to succumb to their group, but they would kind of still outcast me. They were like pushing me, shoving me, they would point at me, then at one point the girl who I thought was nice said “we need space” something along those lines ,basically saying they don’t want me around them. Then I think they were gossiping about me.  
Then at the end of that PE class they started acting weird and started “messing around” with me. They started asking me weird perverted questions like “do you know what a doorknob is” and I’m like “idk” and then they kind of started to act more weird with me and I say something like “stop harassing me” and I tell them to stop then they started messing around with me again. And gaslighted me and told me I’m “bullying them” my heart sank, I was heart broken, I got teary eyed, my chest was aching. I tried to ignore but it was bothering me and it got worse. Then they joined a grouo of girls where they would spread these mean nasty rumors about me about the way I “smelled” and the way I looked.  
They would literally look at me and they would all laugh in a group. I was singled out and everyone knew that “this person and soandso were talking about you” I complained about them to the PE teacher and guidance and they had a “talk” with them and the guidance said they “won’t do it again” but it was heart wrenching. I cried so much that day, I was hurting because of this incident for so many years. Middle schoolers were so mean to me and I used to get picked on ALL the time because I was a shy timid kid that didn’t speak AT ALL. I would be treated like I’m very stupid by my peers/students.  
I would get so much anxiety about it and I had this anxiety and panic attacks till high school (I’m 23 now) reflecting back on it, I don’t know what advice to give to my younger self. I would tell myself to not tell your trauma to outsiders otherwise you’ll keep repeating those experiences. But I feel like because I was “special ed” I wasn’t able to befriend people I wanted to because I was “too stupid “ for the South Asians and I had friends but they were mostly white.

Ok for a bit of context I am F13 and my mom is F45 and I started going to therapy when I was around age 6 and a psychiatrist at age 8 old due to a domestic violence/physicial abuse in my house and ADHD. I have had issues with impulsive/erratic behaviors that have gotten better as I get older but I also go to therapy because I have been dealing with emetophobia, anxiety, problems navigating social life, problems with ADHD, nicotine/alcohol addiction/,self-esteem, past SI and PTSD. 

I also have some issues with my behavior such as anger issues, cursing, irritability and some arguably disrespectful behavior (according to my mom) which I’m trying to work on as well.

I have been to 6 different therapists since I started but I did make a bit of progress in my sessions as far as my mental health. 

My mom started to change the way she parents because she thought that she wasn’t seeing the results she wanted to see so she started taking things away from me for failing to come out of my room before a certain time while getting ready for school, constant humiliation/ridicule and a general lack of consideration on her part. I struggle with making friends and other meaningful connections and I have also dealt with trauma from being kicked out of a friend group where the supposed leaders didn’t like me so I try to make myself more likable to others, and find ways to communicate with others my age outside of school or virtually. I’m not allowed to have any form of social media bc she thinks that its the reason why my graders were slipping in 7th grade and that it “will cause problems for me.” She has also began to do this bs where she says that I’m selfish/rude/narcissistic/disrespectful/ nosy/ irresponsible/etc to make sure I know what I need to work on but when I apply those same terms to her, its seen as disrespectful and I can’t talk to her that way because she is my mother. When I say those things to her she brings up all the times she spent money on me/took me places/or reminds me of the mistakes I’ve made in the past (when i say those things she says its “name-calling”.)

I constantly try to vocalize how I feel abt the way she treats me/things I would like her to change/etc but she constantly refuses to listen or acknowledge that she may be causing a problem by justifying her behavior with “I’m the adult here” or saying that she doesn’t have time to argue with me over this. I started to defend myself even though she is older than me because I constantly feel like I don’t have control over my own life and I constantly get in trouble for voicing my opinions and concerns abt the way she parents. She recently decided to kick me out of therapy because I was cursing, yelling, “name-calling”, etc and said that I can’t go back to therapy until I change my behaviors. I have pleaded with her numerous times to tell her that I still need help and that her reasons for doing this aren’t ethical/fair to me. I try to deal with it on my own but I feel worse with every day and I don’t want to find comfort in drugs/alcohol/unhealthy behaviors to deal with my problems. She also has a tendency to blow things out of proportion when she would update my therapists on what has been going on at home and make me look like the bad guy constantly and forgets that she has contributed to some the issues at home. 

I’m not sure that my African mom’s culture/ideals/friends have influenced her decision to pull me out of therapy but it has influenced her actions and expectations for me.

I need to be able to confide in someone that won’t judge me for my actions and get me the help I need. Even though I can talk to friends, I really don’t want to weigh them down w my own personal issues or make them like me less because of my problems. I can’t talk to a school counselor either because she has made me feel like my problems with others weren’t valid or that there was something wrong with me for being upset with someone that has continually caused problems in my life and she may tell the school about certain things that may get me in trouble and other adults may js tell my mom and she will be livid.

I still want my mom to be in my life but she makes me feel so bad abt myself every day that I don’t feel safe enough to confide in her but if she keeps this up, I can say with full confidence that I won’t want anything to do with her as an adult because she fails to support me in the way I need her to most. I reside in the state of Colorado (US) where minors 12 and older can independently consent to/refuse to consent to psychiatric care w/o parents permission. I really want to go to therapy to better myself in the future as an adult that can advocate for herself and navigate life independently but I’m not sure where to look. If anyone has any suggestions/resources for me I would really appreciate it.",1713157678.0,

No__Correlation,Emotional Support Animals and Landlords,1,1c4dweo,0,"My partner (28F) and I (29M) live in California and want to get a dog as an emotional support animal. She has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and being around our friend’s dog is the most helpful thing we’ve done (more than medication, therapy, exercise, etc). Our concern is that even though ESA’s are protected for California renters, landlords are shitty and the added stress from housing insecurity will offset the benefits of the animal. Within our budget there are only ever one or two properties on the market that say they allow pets so in all likelihood we would need to bring an ESA certification letter to a no-pets-allowed property. Any advice for making landlords more amenable to ESA’s rather than just strong arming them with a certification letter and waiting for them to make up a reason to reject our applications/not renew our lease? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

shadow_to_gold,Boyfriend keeps trying to diagnose me,1,1c4dubt,1,"We’ve had a lot of issues. But a huge one has been drug and alcohol abuse. We went through some dark times and were very codependent. I admittedly had serious trust issues that were taxing on him. But I honestly think a huge factor was the lifestyle and the people it came with. It wasn’t a safe environment in terms of health and stability and untrustworthy friends, so I felt unsafe and it makes sense I had trust issues.

We are currently doing long distance and I think it’s been healthy. I’m not yet sure we should continue our relationship but taking space to figure it out and not in a rush… but one issue is he keeps telling me to get screened for serious mental illness.

The work I’ve been focusing on is trauma work and developing a spiritual practice, meditation and mindfulness, getting sober, rebuilding my own life, spending time with family and healthier friendships so as not to be codependent or revolve around his life. 

I’m not against therapy and have tried in the past when I could afford it. He actually has never had his own therapist. But he reads up a lot on mental illnesses - online - and I feel like almost obsesses about labels. He tells me to do CBT or whatever process. Again, not against it. But I feel like when I bring up sobriety as a priority, he glosses over that. But then turns around and says I should get screened. 

I’m bothered that he acts like he knows what he’s talking about. And hasn’t even tried therapy himself. Except when I suggested we try couples therapy. We tried together very briefly.

I understand that diagnosis can be validating at times and also helpful in determining treatment. But in this case I think I would just feel like someone would be telling me something is wrong with me and I’m not sure how helpful that is. I don’t see the point of therapy as being labeled or medicated. I see the point of therapy as healing.

I feel insulted that he tries to diagnose me when he’s not a professional and he thinks I should get screened. And he’s not exactly working on himself. It just feels like a possible way to blame me for things. Like I’m the problem, not the drugs and alcohol.

Basically I find it more insulting; it’s hard to see it as helpful.

Am I wrong? Am I missing something? Is it a good idea to get screened? It’s not something I would think to do for myself. I’m afraid of something coming up and him using it against me.",1713156834.0,

I don't know what's happening to me, but I feel like I'm getting worse. 

    My mind is becoming so clouded, and I'm having a really hard time remembering things. I'm also just having issues with my emotions and the lack thereof. I can't tell if these are symptoms of ADD or something else, but I don't trust anyone who tells me that I'm okay. Like, how would they know.

    Nobody else in my family has been diagnosed with any chronic mental illness (that I/we know of), so I can't trace it to anything. I feel like I'm the only person who feels this delusional all the time.

I started therapy at 13, was diagnosed with OCD, CPTSD, and ADHD. I also got a bachelors in psychology because my own struggles have given me such a perspective and passion for the field. 

Two years ago, I went through a long period of time that was the roughest and most traumatic things I’d ever gone through. Without getting into too much detail, it was enough that my university suggest that I withdraw for a semester. Which was suppose to be my last semester until I graduated. 

I took the semester to heal and make changes to my situation. Spent nearly a year doing what felt like “healing” or processing things.

But starting on April 8th, my OCD was starting to get really bad. For a period of 24 hours I had a complete mental break. I’ve had plenty of panic attacks or periods of rough mental health. However, this was completely different than what I’ve experienced before. 

It started as a panic attack due to a trauma trigger but reached a point of delusion / fear that felt more like psychosis. I told a friend that I feared I may be in psychosis several times but she believed it was panic attack due to my OCD. 

I unfortunately sent a neighbor I had some crush on some crazy strange texts. Acted even more bizarre in person, and knocked on other neighbors doors. Was obviously in a distraught state and I’m sure scared some people.. After taking some panic attack medicine from my doctor, and getting some needed sleep… I’m so humiliated :/

OCD: Diagnosed when I was 16. 

ADHD: Diagnosed when I was 23. 

I turn 29 in July. I have one kid, two cats, and I left my ex-husband over a year ago for 10 years of abuse. I survived childhood abuse, too. 

It feels like I can’t breathe some days. My chest is so tight. 

I do see a therapist but I don’t want to say anything because I don’t like to be pitied. I don’t like people feeling bad for me. I want to say what I want to say and get a neutral response. But I also don’t want to be analysed. I hate being vulnerable in spaces where people know me. Reddit is safe as an anonymous space because I curate it that way. 

I feel so alone. Half of my family disowned me when I put my father in jail. Friends took my ex’s side even though he tried to kill me and put hands on our child. 

I’m so fucking alone. So fucking sad. Overcome with grief about everything. I know nothing but trauma, I guess I can consider that my default state. Brother assaulted me when I was 16, he was 18. Mom was diagnosed with cancer two times & survived both times. Grew up in poverty and begged on the streets for food as a teenager or we dumpster dived. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I know I have to keep living for my child. I know if I died, it would traumatise the fucking hell out of her. And I love her too much to go through with it. 

But I’m so sad. I’m so fucking sad. And I’m tired.

General_Book2820,How to keep going if no one love me. ,1,1c4cc36,0,"I am 26 years old, I have never had my first kiss, nor have I had a girlfriend and I consider myself ugly (although the people I express that to tell me that it has nothing to do with it, but there is no way they can tell me yes...)

I have never had friends, and I mean those who ask you how you are and listen to you. Just acquaintances, from work and school.

Some of my friends/acquaintances, it's even women who approach them and no one ever approaches me...

I only have 3 very close friends, and I told them my story, in general I am an introvert.

And well, if I'm honest, I had accepted that that was my reality, and that it was better not to believe that it would be different, if it were, it would have already happened in my 26 years.

But it has started to bother me because I see how my classmates from primary / secondary / are already getting married and at work they usually show affection to other people and not to me. (by affection I mean hugs or that feeling that someone cares about you, that they come to greet you or whatever)

I do not rule out that perhaps my insecurities make people think that I reject them, when that is not the case, rather I do it out of respect, perhaps that person does not want me to approach them and it is better not to do it and that makes them not They come closer because they don't want to make me uncomfortable (but I don't think so)... They judge me without even knowing me.


I just want to know what it's like to have someone care about you besides your family, I'm not afraid of being alone. I just want for once in my life to know what it's like to feel loved by someone outside of your own family.

PS: As a child I suffered a lot of bullying, from both sexes until primary school and continued from men until high school, and that has greatly influenced my self-rejection. But I try to move forward being the best version I can, giving love without having to receive anything in return.

I was very hesitant to write this, for fear of being judged, but it was something I had to express and see if it happens to anyone else and how they moved on.

MomoIsBaby,I have something going on with me but I can’t figure out what the issue is,1,1c4bis3,0,"I have a psychiatrist and a therapist, and so far all I’ve got from my treatment is that I have ADHD lol I was diagnosed with GAD and depression a long time ago. One of my previous psych docs thought I had Bipolar Type 2, but when I got my new psychiatrist back in December 2023, she took away my bipolar diagnosis without doing any kind of assessment and said it was more likely that I just have ADHD and was misdiagnosed.

I was taken off my mood stabilizer and put on strattera. That helped for about 3 months, but slowly lost effectiveness. I started craving weed and ended up tripping on a heroic dose of LSD. I wasn’t expecting to trip so hard (long story). During my trip I kept fretting that my psychiatrist was wrong and I really do have bipolar, and I was going to end up having an episode and ruining my life (based on past experiences). 

After that LSD trip, I settled back down somewhat. I also had some issues at work. I have this manager that likes to lecture employees and talk down to us when we’ve done something wrong. It really stresses me out because she chews me out the same way an abusive family member did to me when I was a child.

I got in trouble over something small, I forget what it was, but she had me so angry and upset that I started frantically job hunting. I couldn’t get an interview to save my life, however, and I started spiraling emotionally. 

I was having racing thoughts and severe intrusive thoughts about SH. I came onto Reddit and started posting questions about places to move with good job markets. I impulsively started applying for jobs out of state, and then completely lost the plot and signed a lease to rent a room before I’ve even been hired anywhere.

I guess it’s for the best that I move because my home is very toxic, and I haven’t been doing well living with my family for a long time. 

I want to be excited that I’m moving, but the anxiety and spinning thoughts just won’t go away. I’m still having intrusive thoughts about SH. I won’t hurt myself, but it’s very taxing that I can’t stop thinking about it.

I’m taking medication to help with my ADHD and depression, and I’m also taking something to help me sleep.

I’m just not sure why I’m struggling so much right now. My psychiatrist increased my strattera dosage, and that helped with the worst of my spiraling, but I just can’t relax at all. My brain is so loud and I just want some mental peace.

I don’t really know where I’m going with this. Maybe I just needed to get it off my chest.

b4rbieb4be,I hate myself and the way others perceive me and it is making me want to die,1,1c4b51p,0,"19F, this is gonna be a bit of rant, I just need to get it all out in words honestly. Stay and read my pitiful post, or don’t. Appreciate any and all support. 

I am such a waste of space, I do not feel like a normal human being. I feel like I’m a foreigner in every situation, especially when around other women. I haven’t been given the opportunity to experience fun things in life like other girls, due to a number of setbacks including depression in teenage years, issues in fitting in, and also just being broke. And then for that, I get judged and made to feel more like an outsider… I try to make myself seem more loose and relaxed around new people, but the vibe I get from them makes it seem like they detect I’m not being 100% “normal”.

Probably doesn’t make sense, but I don’t think I’m made to be or should be treated like an outsider. I’m relatively normal for my age, I’m very into feminine things, I can be outgoing and I have a job. But too many times, I’ve been in the predicament where I meet other girls and they act like I’m a loser who doesn’t belong there. I’ve met some girls once and one of them was upset about an incident and I was trying to consul and just be nice like all the others were, and then one girl gives me a death glare and bluntly goes “can you just go stand over there”. I’m rejected from these groups, for absolutely no reason. I feel like girls always talk to me with this attitude and abruptness, just makes me feel like shit.
Why me? What did I ever do wrong but try to be nice? I forever envy the girls on social media who have friends, relationships, and are treated like a normal human.

If people can’t coexist peacefully with me, who is genuinely a good person and wants to go out and make memories, then why should I even stick around depressed? I’m not made to be a loser, I’ve got the drive in me to push for bigger and better things, and a more utopian lifestyle surrounded by friends. Sometimes I think I’m better off just ending it.

Throwaway369783,"I messed up, I can't escape now.",1,1c49yh1,0," I screwed up. About one and a half years ago, I, (14m) had everything I wanted, every reason to live, and was what I would describe as ""happy"". And things were going well, until school started becoming a problem for me, specifically, the people there. I got bullied pretty bad, as well as one boy who *really* wanted to beat me up for seemingly no reason, and only failed because my friends helped me out. Overall, very stressful. But, I had friends, which is something very important to me, I need people around me, I'm definitely an introvert though, I'll explain further why I say need people later.

 So I left school at the end of that year, to be homeschooled, An easy solution, since I generally found being around people, even friends and family, very draining. So I homeschooled, and things were fine, up until about 6 months ago, when the problems began showing. They had always been there, just small and never enough to worry me. The main problem, was having too much mental space. Homeschool was not easier than regular school, but since I was efficient, I spent a far smaller amount of time doing school, while learning the same. I had also of course, sacrificed my friends to avoid the enemies.

 While having spare mental space might seem a good thing, it really wasn't and isn't for me. The spare space is chaos, always. Negative too, never thinking positively. With no people around me to fill my thoughts, my thoughts only think of the bad in the world, the terrible things happening every day. With all that going on in my head, I knew I had to block it somehow, I had to fill my mental space.

 So I started playing video games more, listening to music, and just occupying myself rather than just sitting feeling terrible. And this would be great, except for 2 things. 1. I have become very unfit and overall quite unhealthy, I don't eat enough. 2. The time the thinking issue is the worst is when I'm trying to sleep, so thats when I listen to music/game, which results in getting far too little sleep. Lack of sleep has caused physical exhaustion, but sadly, none of the mental variety. So I now physically don't have the energy to fix things, and can't get enough sleep to get energy. As a terrible side effect, I eat even less while tired, I almost have an aversion to food entirely for the first 4-5 hours of waking, so sometimes breakfast and lunch.

 Now all this abuse to my body, not caring for it at all, is finally catching up to me. I never feel well, can't stay awake during the day, unable to sleep at night, and don't complete the tasks expected of me. My mental health is terrible, I have no one to talk to about it, and I continue to bottle it up and leave it for myself to deal with at night, because im too exhausted in the moment. I can't make good decisions, and I can't handle the chaos in my mind, my own overthinking makes me want to end my own life, non-stop. I can't handle the pressure, from all angles. My siblings talk terrible about me all the time, and I don't have the energy or even care enough any more to defend myself. Im just done, I've had enough. I can't fix it, no one else can either. Exactly why this will join other posts in having 0 replies, idk if I even want one anymore, I'm either typing this to convince myself to commit suicide or to try to seek help, and I don't know which one at this point. Holidays end now, I have to keep functioning, succeeding, being the perfect child I act as, but I can't keep it up anymore, I just can't. It's over, my life is over, because I screwed it up, I started a snowball effect with one bad decision, and now I can't live with myself anymore, I'm done.

I don't consider myself the most responsible person in the world, but as I gain more life experience, I'm doing better and better in terms of work, money, etc. However, an invariable factor in my experience is that when it comes to emotional, internal problems and matters surrounding them, I can\`t fully solve them.

&#x200B;

there are several problems that come back from time to time, usually when one appears I start thinking about the others;

a) Feeling of beeing unloved - (boy oh boy I m sure that this is related to my childhood) I have gf we have been together for couple of years. The problem is we have Anxious-Avoidant Relationship. I dont want to enforce anything, I  can see that even if I would try change anything it just won\`t happen. So many times when my need for closeness comes up I m left alone. It hurts and I left with feeling that I deserve to suffer. I think that it\`s matter of time and she will leave me. I think that I cant change it and this feeling makes me want to end it. But at the same time, I love her. So much.

b) Inability to stick to one thing - in most other cases surrounding my life I just can\`t stick to any one thing, I m constantly trying new things and often I abandon   
previous things. Good thing is that I m a fast learner. I have been playing guitar for some time going in with a tryhard mindset training every day, thinking what I can do to improve how music works why something sound good and how I can insert my feelings into music. But every couple months I m dropping this hobby, forgeting about it for some time. Bcz of that my progress is slowed down. If I remained and never ditched this hobby I would be much much much better guitarist right now. The thing is that I m every time I do this I m investing time and effort into something else, I get good at what I m doing then I ditch it. I have tried beeing a speedruner, I have played some games on pretty high competetive level etc. I m not achiving anything spinning around not beeing able to decide what I should do.

c) Not beeing able to decide what I should do - and here we go the part when I m feeling rage at myself. The part where I m losing my sanity and the part when I want to scream. I don\`t know if I should talk about anything with anyone I dont know if I should stay in my relationship. I dont know if I stay in my current job. I dont know if I should keep going with my hobby. I dont know how to decide, how to choose.

thalyaaa_a,Letter to my dad ?,1,1c495g0,0,"It’s so messy I’m sorry 🧍🏽‍♀️
(I’m sorry for the mistakes I’m not a native English speaker) 

My dad or my daddy, I love him from the bottom of my heart but I can’t help and feel angry. Why did you abandoned me when you divorced mom ? Why you don’t have any pictures of me in your phone? Why do I have to beg for a Facebook post for my birthday while you do a post for everything my little brother do ? Are you okay daddy ? Why don’t you seek for help ? Why are you such a stranger to me ? Am I still your little princess or am I just your daughter ? Why did your behavior against me changed so much ? Am I enough for you daddy ? I want to ask you all of those questions because I’m so angry and I don’t even know why, I don’t even know if asking you those questions will make me feel better or not. Even with all of the anger I have inside of me I can’t help but I just want to hold you in my arms. You have being trough so much, you had to grow up way too fast and you do pretty well now but daddy Am I holding you back from living your life ? Am I a burden for your new family life ? Are you angry at me for trying to kill myself multiple times? 

I love my dad ( I live in his house now) but I feel like he doesn’t understand me, I’m not waiting for a lot I don’t have a lot of expectations but I just want him to really understand where do I come from. I was the youngest with my mother, a glass child always in the shadows of my big brother, the rebellious child, the black sheep he thinks it’s not a lot but for me it was traumatic and I build my personality around this. I’m also angry at him because when I was younger when I needed him he was not there, he gave me the occasion to throw away my Father’s Day gift in tears because he didn’t come and pick me up, he didn’t come to my dance show after promising he would be there  and he wasn’t there to hug me when I was crying after him for years wondering what did I do for my daddy to abandon me. I remember praying every night wishing that he was okay. 
And then he build his life again with my step mom and my little brother, I felt so betrayed there’s no other words. Even now at 17 years old I still feel betrayed in the deepest part of my heart but I feel so guilty for feeling this way. When I came back in your life you pushed everything aside even your new family to take care of me but even you, you knew the time we had lost was lost forever and couldn’t be restored. You don’t have to blame yourself for everything because I still love you and I’m the one to blame because I made a lot of mistakes because I wanted to be seen by mom.

It’s your first time being an adult and I know you’re trying to do your best but I feel so bad making you live those situations. And since you don’t have my big brother anymore I’m trying to take his place in your heart so you can still feel like you have your first child/son by your side but I don’t think it’s working to be honest. 
I know that I’m difficult and that my mental health is not the best but please dad take care of you, I’m just asking for that. 

I love you dad, you are the strongest person I know , I would want you to be my dad in every universe.

Im ever so tired of this behavior. Im an adult, yet i often struggle with my mental health and ADHD.

Im often a nervous wreck and struggle to get my life in order, call it ADHD paralysis if you like.

The thing is, my parents constantly keep telling me i should open up more and let people help me and they always act so perplexed when im reluctant to accept the help.

The truth is i ALWAYS, almost without fail, get guilt tripped by them after accepting their help. If i make an independent decision they dont like theyll usually start using the things theyve done for me against me, to try to guilt me into living my life the way they have decided is best for me. And if i push back and set up boundrieds everything collapses, they tell me theyll never help me again because of blah blah. Then they act like i never help them in return(which is not true in the least. I try my absolute best to help them, as long as my mental health allows it).

He shouted for his mum (she’s been dead for a long time) and he didn’t realise he was in the hospital. He kept pulling out his IV’s and lost 24-48 hours worth of medication and fluids. They told us on Wednesday he had a 50% chance of surviving the night. He survived, and is drastically better, so why do I feel like this? I feel hopeless and agitated. Today was the first time I had cried in maybe 2 months. I’ve been in shock for that amount of time due to him and another few issues. I had to contact Samaritans because I didn’t know who else to turn to. I have been traumatised by this experience, and I feel a massive wave of guilt if I don’t go and see my granda every night (I didn’t go today because I was exhausted and I didn’t go on Friday because I needed some me time). He doesn’t care if I don’t go, but I’m so scared that the sepsis will take hold and kill him overnight. I have had a massive surge in overall anxiety and OCD surrounding cleaning and my appearance too. I don’t want to eat. I have no appetite. I feel suicidal at work (not because of work) and I don’t know how to continue. I’m so overwhelmed. I have my driving test on Tuesday aswell as two essays to get down in one week. I’m so fucking overwhelmed I could break down right now. I JUST NEED PEACE AND I CANT SEEM TO GET IT. ",1713141612.0,
Ornery_Ad3065,i need advice sigh,1,1c48ud6,3,"I will be putting nsfw warning and because it has SA content.
 So I, 19F was seeing this guy 27M for about a month in August 2023. In that span we never slept together just made out a couple of times. One day i decided to invite him to hang around at my place. We already had discussed what we liked in bed and how we liked it. I had mentioned that i like it a bit rough but still gentle.
Things went south that day. We were hanging around and things started escalating i was highkey excited. But soon enough i saw what he really was. He wanted me to be his pet slave that he can just beat up (mind you he is a 200 pound man and i weigh around 130). I was a bit uncomfortable but i reluctantly agreed thinking he’d still be gentle with it since i liked getting degraded and hit (but not beaten up way).
I was so wrong. He started beating the fuck out of my breasts and slapping my face and didn’t stop for a good 30 mins even though i begged and cried for him to stop. he pulled my hair harshly and slapped so hard for crying that i felt like i had a concussion. even after that he didn’t stop.
He twisted and pulled my nipples so hard that i could see visible skin coming off. my breasts had these HUGE green and purple and red bruising 60% covering them. 
after the incident i ghosted him and  we stopped talking for the good. So the thing with me is after anything traumatic happening with me i can snap back to normal very quick and live my life like i normally do till it starts affecting me in 6months or maybe a year.
Now, i have been in an amazing relationship with this man for 6months and things are good. But slowly all those things i described earlier are coming back in my head. it is affecting my head so much like the disgust, guilt and shame i feel and i have started being scared of being intimate with my bf even though we do have an active sexual life. i cant bring this issue with him since he hates talking about my past and vice versa.
i need help.
also i dont have means to get therapy either.

i am 20f from europe, and have been smoking weed for the past year or so, daily for like 6 months. it is causing miserable dissociation and other mental health issues, that force me to re-evaluate whether it is even worth it.. smoking takes up so much of my life, it robs me of time and energy. i want to feel connected to my life again so badly, i want to feel present.

there is so much more to me as a person than what weed is limiting to be. i am kind, silly, and criminally self-aware. i love arts and crafts, cozy games, some animes, and fantasy writing. but more than anything, i love sharing my passions, connecting with people and feeling like i am part of a community - i guess that's what im looking for right now. :)

i would like to smoke less, potentially quit altogether. i just want someone to talk to regularly throughout my process, maybe someone on the same journey, so we can encourage each other and stay strong!

if anyone is interested, please message me! if the chat goes well i would love to continue on whatsapp.

 ive been going to therapy since before my first stay and have tried so many different meds that i cant even remember all of them. i havent been going to therapy for a few months now and i nor anyone around me has noticed a difference in mood or mindset or anything really, if anything i started to be less stressed about leaving the house. 

im not sure what to do at this point because pretty much any mental health treatments are triggers for my PTSD (including many PTSD treatments), inpatient or any sort of residential isnt an option, therapy hasnt ever worked on me, i dont have any energy left for hobbies or really anything that used to make me happy anymore, and im just so tired of being tired of life. i dont want to be here anymore, im not going to try and take my life because i know that that would hurt people around me and my dog wouldnt know where i went but i dont want to live like this anymore. 

every single noise i hear freaks me out, nothing tastes good anymore, i havent been happy for any amount of time in months, i dont exactly have a future ahead of me due to me not being able to be in school, and i just generally dont have much to live for. ive been having an average of two panic attacks a day for months now and nothing is helping, it just feels like an endless cycle of being terrified of the next panic attack and then waiting for one to be over.

Desperate_Raccoon_,A Poem I Wrote: A Girl Named Ana,1,1c47yos,0,"I met this girl. I'm going to call her Ana, since, you know, that's what everyone who's ever been close to her has called her. Ana and I go way back. For those who have never met her, let me tell you a little bit about her. Her name is Ana, she is tall and thin. She definitely likes pink more than any other color (but swears she's not picky). She likes to befriend the vulnerable and the ones who hate their body. She always likes to hang out in the gym more than the kitchen. And of course, she thinks that every girl wants to be her best friend and can never seem to understand when she says something hurtful. Since like 2019, I think. I was just about a sophomore in high school when she formally introduced herself to me. She helped me make my school's dance team that year and since then we've been practically inseparable. Ana and I were really close but she made me promise that there was no way that my parents could ever know about our relationship. They would want me to stop seeing her, and say that I was broken and I was sick, and that I needed help. So, Ana and I hung out in complete secrecy. We hung out at school, and at dance, and even went shopping together. The only problem was that I was hanging out with Ana so much that I never had the time nor energy to hang out with my other friends. But still, I wouldn't – I mean I couldn't tell my parents about Ana. In 2020, I unfortunately had an accident and ended up in a special kind of hospital, and of course Ana had to come along. She made me feel safe when nothing else did. During my one month at the 'special' hospital, my relationship only grew stronger with Ana. But, all of my nurses and all of my doctors kept insisting that Ana didn't hang out with people that looked like me. They tried telling me that Ana didn't want me and didn't like people like me, but Ana just squeezed my hands even tighter. Of course, she's my best friend. Ana's not picky. Ana likes those she can control. Those who fear letting her down. Ana definitely chose me. The only problem is Ana tried to kill me. She made me sick and made me weak. And she held on as long as she could. But I'm finally ready to end my 6 year relationship with her. There's a better friend I've found. Her name is Recovery.

lettingitaaaaaallout,Feel like I'm constantly drowning.,3,1c3zcwz,0,"This is probably just going to be a massive ramble, sorry.

I can remember being a toddler, a child,, riddle with fear over everything whether it was men, school, talking to people, just leaving the house, food, just everything. 

With time I stopped being scared of some of those things, or maybe I just got better at dealing with it. 

I'd be scared of teachers, making a fool of myself in school, saying the wrong thing, doing the wrong things, my parents arguing downstairs, family getting sick.

Then I got to secondary school and obviously I was a ""nerd"" and got picked on, thought I had some good friends but I didn't really (that'll come later).

I didn't think about college, I didn't think I'd be alive that long. I was though, and picked whatever I was good at and dealt with it. I hated it, lost some friends, for average grade. I learnt how to drive and then never drove again out of fear.

I didn't think about uni, I didn't think I'd be alive that long. I was though, and picked whatever I was good at and dealt with it. I hate it, lost more friends, didn't make new ones, didn't leave home, didn't have a career plan.

I didn't think about work, I didn't think I'd be alive that long. You see a pattern? I got a shitty factory job, honestly looking back it wasn't shitty, I just felt wrongly ashamed of it. I left after a few years, after I lost my last friend in a really awful way, and got a simple part time job closer to home. 

I thought that was my chance, my chance to fix myself a little. Then a few months later the pandemic started. Then a few months later my dad died, it was horrible and sudden and I've not been right since. Now I deal with pretty severe health anxiety, which isn't helped by the multitude of physical health problems I've had since that that have had no real explanation.

Around this same time my sister finished secondary school (there's a 10 year age gap between us) with below average grade (hello, pandemic) and tried going to college but couldn't handle it. She's not working, not in education, doesn't go out much. I worry about her constantly but don't know what to do or how to help. I'm not fit to help myself nevermind anyone else.

I applied for a new job, which turned into a slightly different job that I don't want. The flexibility has gone and I literally handed in my notice just before Christmas because of the stress, but was convinced to stay. I love the people I work with, I hate the job. Try suffering from severe health anxiety while working in a hospital, it's not great.

Recently my Mum has been incredibly stressed with her job, dealing with some health issues, and I don't know how to help her either. I still live at home (I mean, you've read this far, you can probably tell that), help with chores and bills, but I can't deal with other people's problems, not on top of mine.

Now, last week, my Nanny (who we're very close to) ended up in the hospital. She's been very ill over many, many years, and this was a big hit. She's been living with my uncle for several years since her last major hospital admission, and we found out today she's scared of him. We had no idea. 

So, basically, she needs to live with us so we need to move. We need to sell her house and ours and move into another house quickly. She might be able to stay with a close cousin of ours if she comes out of hospital before we can sort that, but that's not really ideal. Thankfully my Mum knows someone who has a bungalow they want to sell, would be a good place but needs a lot of work, it has an annex my Nanny could use as she's very independent.

Anyway, since finding out I've done nothing but cry and panic and sit paralyzed. I'm overwhelmed. I don't know what to do anymore, I can't live like this anymore, constantly scared and guilty. I keep thinking what if I'd got a better education, a better job, made more money, moved out. Maybe my Nanny would have moved in with my Mum instead all those years ago. What if I had a better go with relationships, met someone started a family, had more people to help and support us. Will I have to look after my Nanny now? Will I have to pick up driving again to take her places because no one else can? Will I need to move out if we can't find a big enough place to live? How will I afford that?

I'm not a risk to myself or anyone else anymore, too scared of dying now for that, but I am worried one day I'm just going to snap, get on a train or walk into a forest and never come back, just a full mental break. 

I just realised today that I've honestly never really been happy. I've had moments while watching a good film or reading a good book where I've had fun, where I've enjoyed consuming that content, but I don't think I've ever been calm enough or felt safe enough to be happy. 

I've never gone to the doctor's about this, I've thought about it but always just felt like I'd ""get over it"" or that it was my fault or that I was making a big deal out of nothing. I don't really feel that way now, but I do feel too scared to go, like my GP will say all those things, or worse. 

I don't know what this is, no one will read it probably, and I know any advice would just be to reach out to someone (not that I have anyone to reach out to, I certainly can't go to my Mum or sister), or go to my GP or whatever. I know I should. I know I need to do something. But I'm just, I don't know how. 

Anyway, sorry, I just needed to put this somewhere. I don't know what I'm doing, I'm just exhausted.",1713116760.0,
BeaByte,Out of abusive relationship for just shy of two years. TWs: Abuse and Suicide,1,1c47ows,0,"I was in an extremely mentally and emotionally abusive relationship for about a year. I’ve thought for about a year that I was completely over the abuse, my ex-partner, and just everything surrounding this. 

This relationship at it’s worst involved talking them down from suicide, daily for months. Sleep deprevation from the prior. Bounderies would be respected… at first for about a day or two until things would slide, one by one until the boundary was gone. I had to screenshare my devices randomly and frequently, I can only assume this was to monitor who and what I was talking to people about. I was told lies about all my friends at the time, spoonfed lies about my family. This broke down basically all my outside relationships.

&#x200B;

I was at a support group (which is unrelated to this abuse). At one point the topic of relationships came up. I haven’t really spoken to anyone about this since it first happened, obviously it occasionally comes up but nothing in-depth or great detail. I managed to say about two short sentances, and I just fucking froze. This emotion just overcame me, it just felt like I was right back in that relationship all over again. The sheer fear I felt in that moment, because I realised just how much power they still have over me, and that my reality was entirely shaped by them for a year, I thought this shit was normal, this feeling is just so overwhelming.  

&#x200B;

It really makes me wonder how much of my other problems; low self-esteem, lack of self-respect, self-hatred and trust issues stem from this. I don’t really know what the point of this post is but holy shit. I just needed to actually write this down somewhere, anywhere. ",1713137819.0,

The kind condensed into morning dew, suspended on the soft fur of a dead animal. It moves when I do, a rich slush of grey matter and rot. There’s a bit of Me in there, just above the surface, pressed between the sick, between the frontal and parietal. But when I move the waters beat against it and I feel my thoughts wash away like sand, eroded and impermanent and insignificant in the face of a greater power.  

I wish that I was a purely cerebral being; that my body was simply a way to get from point A to B - a vehicle that I keep clean, and repaired, and fed. But more and more I find myself dominated by my body, not my mind. There is no easy fix, and I am reminded that I am not distinct from nature - that I am ruled by the same laws as all those decaying things.

I cannot begin to express how difficult it is to even understand him. (1) He does not know the right words to say (he pronounces ""effort"" like ""otter""), his words overlap (he might say ""hwhent"" when he means ""he went""), sometimes his face does not move at all when he talks and sometimes his face is on overdrive with visual cues when he talks. However, he is a brilliant programmer. He's had an extremely difficult time finding a job - but he seems to find start-ups that will tolerate his conversational difficulties because he has a very strong github/profolio.

At his last job a female co-worker showed him even a modest amount of friendliness. She would sit with him at work-conventions, she would ask for his help with her projects/assignments, they would work together on cooperative projects. In late 2023, he learned that she is seeing someone. He interpreted her friendliness as a crush and when he said something to her she said that she does not see him as anything more than a co-worker. Around the same time, due to unrelated events, she was fired (from what I understand because the company was a start-up) and in a show of solidarity - my friend quit his job as a response to her being fired. His boss was very patient and tried to talk him out of quitting but that did not work.

It has been over 9 months and my friend has not gotten over her. He learned a programming language that she worked on, just because he hoped that she would find his github on want to work on projects together. My friend has discovered AI generated content - and is using AI to write love letters to her - he has posted them on his twitter and github (seriously) - his personal website for job searching has his twitter feed and these are visible on his personal website. My friend went silent for a month or two, I thought he went to Taiwan - but instead his father confiscated his computer for two months because he thought he was possessed by a 'devil'. (his mother is deceased)

I am going to be direct: I have seen middle schoolers behave better with one-sided relationships than my friend. I am genuinely worried he is going to stalk her - his behavior has gotten a lot worse in last two weeks. He updated his github 56 times one day with various relationship like things. For example, he is making AI-generated 'peach and goma'like images with the cats being in a relationship (seriously!) - and is still posting love letters (the most recent one was ""I knew you love me despite our arguments"" [in md5 encryption]). He sometimes, includes her name in these love letters and 'memes' so I know these are directed to her. 

I do not know what to to do. I have tried, repeatedly, to help him engage in constructive projects and try to cheer him up. I said to him that I think he should talk to a doctor but my friend says the pills make him sleepy.",1713137689.0,

MiserableLobster8897,How to end a very new and quite worrying friendship?,1,1c474um,0,"
Using a throwaway because I’m concerned that if this guy finds out I feel this way it might be detrimental to him. I’ve obviously taken out all the identifying details for the same reason. 

It’s going to be a long one. 

So my friend A and I met at a social club, and I recently met her boyfriend B as well. A couple of days ago I told A about a mental health charity which has helped me and she said that her friend C might benefit from it as well, and asked me to send her the details. She said that, like me, C is transgender, autistic/neurodiverse (I forget the exact word she used, and has been in the care system. 

I sent her the details the next evening and she asked if she could give C my number because it might help him to have a friend with some of the same experiences. I try to avoid relationships based on shared trauma because there’s a risk of them turning unhealthy, but it sounded like we had some common interests, so I said sure. 

He texted me a few hours later at 1am and said he’d like to come to the charity project. I said that it might take a while for him to become a member, but that he could come to a community centre type place where I and some of my other friends hang out instead. He said he’d like to come. He warned me that he has selective mutism and either talks too much or not at all, and I said that’s fine. He also said that he’s a furry and always wears animal ears (his name is the name of the animal he dresses as) and asked if he’d be judged for that, and I said probably not. 

Yesterday I texted C saying there was a craft activity group on at the community centre, and he said he’d get B to take him. My friend D was in charge and so I told him about C and to be nice to him. C got there maybe an hour later and D and I introduced ourselves. C seemed really nervous and quiet, and since he said he has selective mutism I assumed he’d get stressed out answering questions in front of new people (there were three other people there besides D and myself) so I didn’t ask him anything directly, which in hindsight I think may have made him feel left out. 

A few minutes later he got up and left, and after a while D asked if I’d seen him. I said no and did a quick search of the building, then texted C to ask if he was okay, but got no reply. Then D told me that somebody had reported that there was screaming coming from the ladies’ toilets. I called C and immediately heard growling/roaring, but that turned out to be his answerphone message. Then D started getting visibly nervous and told me to go and check on him. 

I felt weird going into the ladies’ toilets and I’ve also had traumatic experiences in care/hospital where I saw other residents hurting themselves, so this was not fun for me. I went into the toilets and heard C crying. I asked if he was okay, and he said he was overwhelmed and would rather be left alone. 

I left and texted A saying that C was having some kind of episode and was there anything I should do. She implied that this happens a lot and told me that she and B were on the phone with him (that’s who he was screaming at/to). 

After about fifteen minutes, D told me to check on C again and said that he was worried he might hurt himself. D told me that he would use his own money to pay for a taxi to get C home safe. I went back into the toilets and talked to C, but he refused the taxi and said that he wanted B to pick him up. I think B was busy with studying or something (he’s a medical student) and couldn’t be there right away.

A and B arrived maybe another fifteen minutes later, by which time C had come out of the bathroom and was calmer, but was still visibly upset and shaking. He told me that he’s agoraphobic and apologised for melting down, to which I said that it’s fine. 

A, B, C, D and I talked for a while, and C and D got on quite well because they both like really extreme horror movies (think A Serbian Film or Salo), but C and I had basically nothing in common apart from very superficial things like being transgender. After a while, C started getting nervous again and A and B took him home. 

Once they were home, A texted me saying that she understands if I don’t want to hang out with C again but that he’d really like to be my friend. Obviously I did not enjoy hanging out with him and would rather not do it again, but I didn’t want to say that because I know that it would upset C. I told her very diplomatically that I’d like to hang out with him again, but only in a group setting where I’m not the one responsible for his welfare. She said that he would never be scream at me, and that when he gets upset he phones B, but that’s not really the issue for me. It’s more just that the whole experience was really more than I could comfortably deal with. I would have liked a warning from A that C frequently has meltdowns like this, but that I shouldn’t be worried because he doesn’t actually hurt himself. 

Then C texted me saying that he’d like to come to the community centre soon to watch a movie that’s on. I hinted that maybe he’d like to bring a friend, but he said that his only friends are A and B (by the way, I have no further information about how he met B or how the relationship works). I said that B seems like the kind of person who would like that movie, but C said he isn’t. 

I really want to avoid interacting with C alone again, because it was extremely stressful. The way he behaves reminds me a bit of myself a few years ago when I was very unwell, and that’s upsetting for me. I still struggle to keep my own issues under control sometimes, and I just don’t have the skills to deal with somebody else’s. 

There’s also the issue that it was stressful for D and a couple of other people at the centre. I don’t want them to be in that position, since many people at the centre also have autism, a learning disability or a mental health issue. Since I was the only person who knew C (for less than 12 hours at that point), they expected me to check on him and sort everything out. Some of the people there have absolutely no tact, and since C dresses up in animal ears and uses gore/goreself pronouns as well as he/him, I know that if he continues to come, somebody will say something insensitive at some point and I’ll be responsible. 

Also, I don’t want to accidentally end up playing the same role in C’s life as B. Maybe if we had more in common I’d want to spend a lot of time with him, but as it is I don’t want to. C seems to be extremely dependent on B, and there are already a few signs that maybe C struggles with boundaries (texting me late at night, etc). I don’t want to set a precedent that I’m capable of providing C with support, and since he said he has no other friends I’m concerned that he might ask me to support him when A and B are unavailable. I’d rather avoid forming a relationship with him that might make him turn to me for help.

All of this makes me feel like a terrible, selfish person. I know that I shouldn’t shun a person for their mental health issues, and have felt hurt in the past when others have shunned me for mine. The way I’ve reacted to C has made me realise how much everybody probably dreaded my company when I was at my most unwell, and it’s just not a nice thing to think about. Nothing about this whole experience has been at all fun or even tolerable for me, and I’m dreading a repeat of it. 

What I want to know is how to let C down gently. He seems extremely delicate and I don’t want to make his situation worse. I also don’t want A or B to think I’m a bad person. I really struggle with setting clear boundaries and don’t know what to do. 

TLDR: a friend of a friend with very obvious emotional issues wants to hang out with me but the whole thing stresses me out. ",1713136277.0,

WaffleSpank,Living situation between my mother and abusive and mentally disabled father.,1,1c4675b,0,"
This is a lot to unfold, and I really thank anyone who takes the time to read this and give me guidance, because I am at wits end. My mother has been married to my father for over 35 years, but over the past 3 years he has been having progressive presentation of dementia with depression/anxiety and it has been significantly affecting my mothers life. Before this all happened, right before the COVID lockdown, my father was a very successful business man, very personable and reasonable, although a little bit full of himself. As of now, he is a completely different person. Now my father can completely take care of himself regarding to regular activities of daily living (bathing, changing, cooking, cleaning), but does not have the capacity to go shopping or go to doctors appointments on his own and relies on my mother for that. This wouldn’t be such a big deal for my mother, as she really is a saint, but as a result of his mental decline, he had recently been more and more aggressive towards my mother. He will have almost biweekly episodes where he will have a mental breakdown over something like my mom not wanting to watch TV with him, or talking on the phone to me or my sister (which is the strangest thing to me), and he will steal her phone, physically hit and shove her, and try to prevent her from leaving the home. Despite him being mentally disabled, he is a massive 6 foot 6 and can physically dominate my mother if he wanted to. The police have been called multiple times for these episodes which de-escalates things immediately, and incredibly enough my father, when he wants to, can make it seem like he’s completely normal when talking to other people, like police/ doctors, but is in a constant anxiety-ridden, whiny, childlike state when with my mother. He has been assessed by psychologists, psychiatrists, neurologists, is on medications (that don’t seem to help much despite many attempts at different med regimens), and the only real physiological explanation for his complete change in personality was shown on an MRI revealing frontal-temporal atrophy of his brain (likely dementia).

 My father really has not been the best Husband to my mother, he had multiple affairs and has been verbally abusive in the past (never physical). However with his current condition he can no longer drive or work and is just cooped up at their home which they both own. They do not have any other properties, nor does my father have another place to go. But my mom is losing her mind. She is taking care of someone who at the flip of a switch, can just ruin her day and harm her. 

We are trying to figure out the best way to move forward. Without my father’s income my parents don’t have a wealth of financial resources. My mother wants to live apart from him but we can’t figure out how to make that work financially and in a way that he will be safe as well. 

I currently live out of state with my fiancé, and have been dealing with all of this remotely. I will be moving back this year living fairly close to my parents, which I think will help my mother slightly, but isn’t a solution. 

TLDR; Mother wants to move out away from my abusive mentally-disabled father, but has limited financial resources, and unsure of most humane way to get my father the support he needs without the help of my mother. ",1713133744.0,

My mom found out & took me off her health insurance. The meds weren’t working anyway but still like wtf. So 17 no health insurance psychiatrist or therapist. Then one day at school a guy gave me  this tan rectangular pill. From that one pill it felt like someone pulled a gun on me and robbed me of my anxiety. For years i went to doctors back & forth to get adequate mental health care. One day my aunt took me to an inpatient program to get help because I was in a really bad place. When I got out, I went to CVS to pick up my prescription of Klonopin. They prescribe me and on my way home. I got shot. The police took the  Klonopin out my car, but left the  ssri’s. Since then, I’ve tried so hard to get out going to different psychiatrist, different healthcare providers and honestly just I feel like you know me being black. I just never got adequate care. So I started self medicating and my life improved and now I found ketamine and that helps even more but what I’m trying to say is am I wrong for self-medicating when I feel like no one will help me or even cares?

PS when I was 18 l had my first panic attack. My mom called the police sign and I went to jail.

I've struggled with Mental illnesses since I was a child. I experienced a couple traumatic events when I was about 4/5, and then another big one around 13, when my depression, anxiety and OCD started.

My parents were of the thoughts that you don't talk about those things because you don't want to be labeled. So I didn't for many years. But eventually I did seek counseling. However, I haven't found any counselors/therapists that have actually helped, and here I am approaching 35, 4 kids of my own, and a poor husband who bears the weight of these struggles.

It’s not one with her either, I can’t even actually interpret my own emotions. I cry and can never actually understand what made me cry. I always just assume it’s ADHD mood swings, but it’s more than that.

For example: my gf was telling me that I need to change and just stop saying and doing the stupid things I do (this is my wording, not hers). I completely agree with what she was saying, that she can’t handle another year of me saying and doing the dumb small mistakes, cause it has been driving her insane and makes her doubt that I love her.

Qmeieriet,The general approach to Psychiatric/Phycological (psychosocial) first-aid!,1,1c43yxo,0,"**The general approach:** Psychiatric (psychosocial) first-aid is extremely important, and there are some steps you follow:

(1. **Assess the situation**  

- As soon as possible, you must check your surroundings for dangers to your own safety and that of others and take preventative measures to ensure that you remain safe, this includes **contacting your local EMS**

**Do not hang up on EMS unless they tell you to and give EMS feedback as you go along**, as well as rely on them for guidance if you are unsure. EMS is your best friend in any healthcare emergency, use them for what they are worth.

* It might sound egoistic but it's important that you as a caregiver are safe so you can provide the assistance and help needed without the danger of being harmed.

(2. **Contact and engagement**

* talk to the patient in a non-confronting manner and actively listen to them, do not try to argue against them as that can escalate their frustration. Instead try to understand that they could be in acute distress; worried; psychotic/delusional or scared (depending on what the crisis is).
* If you come off as confrontive or judgmental the patient can quickly become defensive and reluctant to assistance/treatment, or become hostile and potentially a danger to themselves or others (such as the first-aider trying to help them).

(3.  **Safety and comfort**

* respect, patience, and understanding are needed. Make sure they are in a safe environment where they feel comfortable, if possible stay with them and try to be comforting by showing them that you're there and they are being taken care of and aren't in any danger.
* Do not restrain them, you quickly run the risk of harming them; yourself and/or causing them to become hostile, let the proper personnel restrain them (e.g Police)

(4. **Stabilization**

* use distraction techniques, such as talking with them about their interests; hobbies; have them tell you a story or engage in other topics that take the focus away from the crisis.

(5. **Information gathering**

* get as much information about their condition as possible, pay attention to their mood and behaviour (this could be important for EMS and should be relayed back to your local EMS). If there are other people present who know the patient you can ask if the patient is known to have the symptoms/crisis and if they have a treatment plan or use any medication (**DO NOT** give any medications without being explicitly told so by qualified healthcare personnel, which rarely, if ever, happens).

(6. **Practical assistance**

* help them if there's anything they need or if they struggle with obtaining their basic needs. Provide physical and emotional stability, and offer practical assistance, such as: giving them water if thirsty; blanket if they are cold; or other practical help that can make them more comfortable.

(7. **Connections**

* reach out to those you believe can help them, for example: ask if there is anyone they would like for you to call/reach out to, such as: family; friends; or others who they feel confident in and that will be supportive.
* Be mindful about who you involve as they need to be able to de-escalate and not provoke them, this includes those around you; unless there is someone who is either trained in psychosocial first-aid or personally knows the patient, then having them leave the scene is your go-to.
* **The fewer people (bystanders) the better**, it’s a high pressure situation for both the patient and you as care-giver, and having bystanders is not only a distraction but can be potentially aggravating for the patient
* *(This goes back to point 1. Assessing the situation and taking preventative measures to ensure everyone's safety. As well as point 3. Safety and comfort, having a lot of people around may be distressing)*.

**Remember** that you as a psychosocial first-aider is **not** a therapist, nor is it your job to act as one or try to treat them beyond your capabilities (this includes not assuming diagnoses; suggesting path of treatment; or suggest medication).

* **As mentioned:** It can make it difficult for EMS and the eventual therapist/treatment team to work with them if you have created expectations or made promises.",1713128030.0,

I knew why because I had very hight expectations for myself since this is the only subject that I did study the whole year so from the stress my body seemed to have shut down  and I took an easy subject to study in the summer to get high grades since I developed also anxiety after what happened with the maths  I tried to study hard but I couldn’t I got B I mean at least I didn’t fail anyway started year 11 after finishing the november exams right away and now I am taking as biology and physics and global perspectives ( a subject for doing research) and also i didn’t study the whole year and now the finals exams have 23 days left and my psychiatrist did put me on the maximum dose of a medication for both anxiety and depression so now don’t feel anxiety and depression episodes as intense but I don’t study maybe I am not anxious now and it may be because I am used to do nothing all the time because I was stressed but now I am not really that stressed so I need to get good grades in these subjects and the time is very short. I feel sometimes like even if I passed got into college or after it got a job I will never be free, free from the feeling that I have the stress of the whole world over my head or will never be happy or that why even try from the beginning cause you’re stupid and a failure.

Good_Ad5625,Need Advice. Friend is causing my depression?,1,1c43q6k,0,"Hi everyone,  
  
This is my first time posting on reddit with this kind of topic so please be patient with me.  
  
So I am 25 years old. Growing up, I never had depression as bad as I had it starting back in Summer of 2023. I had anxiety and the occasional getting I guess what I would call just “Sad”.  
  
Back in the summer of 2023 I became close with a co-worker of mine, we will name him Sean. Sean is straight and I am gay. To make a long story short, I developed feelings for Sean, always feelings, never any sexual feelings. I never told him at the time but Sean, another friend Tom and myself would talk a lot at work since we worked nights and had nothing else to do on our down time. I started comparing myself to Sean a lot, the fact that he was straight, I thought at one point I may have been bi-sexual (Which I think I may still be but Idk), the fact that he has a GF, I tried looking for a Girlfriend or boyfriend 24 hours a day, he has a beach house, I started looking at apts to move into and out of my parents house, etc. Sean would always make comments to me about being gay. If I said something too hyped up he would say “Wow the way you just said that is so Gay”, or when he came over to my apartment and saw I had a Disney picture hanging on the wall he would say “That picture is so gay”. This fucked with me mentally because I felt like I again was comparing myself to him and was trying to change myself to avoid those comments. Our job is very stressful, we work in public safety. How we joke around is with deep dark humor, and making fun of eachother, which I never ever had issues with, I myself would make homophobic jokes, etc. For some reason, when he entered my life these things really fucked with my head. Back in July of 2023 I got so bad I didn’t leave my bead for over 20 something hours because, at the time I felt sad, now looking bad it was the start of my depression setting in.  
  
I would like to add I knew him about 6 months prior to hanging out with him outside of work, these feelings only started when I hung out with him outside of work and MET HIS GIRLFRIEND. I maybe got a little jealous of her. It’s funny, when he first got hired I got the ick and was like he's gross, but I guess someone with a good personality does something to you…  
  
Ok, so now that is covered let’s fast forward to October of 2023. Me not telling him that I had feelings for him was eating me alive. I never went into it expecting him to say he had feelings too, despite the subtle cues I was picking up, like him calling me his “bitch” and what is mine is his when it came to stuff I owned, or him asking me to wash his dish at work because again, “I'm his bitch”. It was also fucking with my head when he would talking about his Girlfriend, him and her are not like a normal relationship. He would always say how he is only going to propose to her when she gets a job that makes more money than him, etc. (It’s more on the joking side but still to me that is kinda fucked up with the stuff he would say). There is one point a few weeks ago I said something about weight and he said “yea well we are the same weight but you have man boobs and a gut”). That broke me, I started acting differently, when he said that on the phone I acted like someone else was calling me and went home and did not eat the whole day. I know how to fix it, to work out which I am doing but that something about how he said it broke me a little. It’s hard to get away from this as I tried to back away in the past and he has asked me why am I giving him the cold shoulder or being different. It’s hard when it’s someone you work with for 12 hours a day 4 days a week. I have never had any of these depression feelings, until I met him. Is this what a toxic friendship is? I’m not sure. Back in November of 2023 I had to tell him. I told him I had feelings for him, and confirmed that those feelings are not longer active (which at the time it wasn’t but I guess they slowly creeped back in). He took the information and I thought he would banish me and not talk to me which was my biggest fear, but he said to give him some time. Fast forward to now, it’s like I never told him anything. Me and him are still close as we were and talk. The only person that knows all of this is my closest work friend, we will call her Julie.  
  
I just feel like at this point it’s a revolving door. I get these waves and they come and go. I got a few days of severe deep depression and my head gets very, very dark, and then within a matter of an hour I flip back and am Ok. It’s maybe to the point I need medication. Back in August when all of this started I noticed it and started seeing someone and doing weekly and bi weekly therapy but I feel as if I can’t talk about my real thoughts in the session as they will try to commit to me. My depression stems from me hating myself so much. For being Gay and allowing myself to develop feelings for straight guys and getting myself into this mental space. The whole maybe being Bi is something that has always been a thing, I went from HS, to working at one job where I didn’t come out as gay to my current job where I came out as gay to a few people, not now almost everyone knows. So part of me is like did I rush into being gay? I am sexually attracted to men, and have thoughts about sex with women, but it’s weird, I get the ick of being in a relationship with a male, but not a female Crazy… right. I can’t pinpoint if it’s just me trying to compare myself to him and others or if it’s a true feeling… guess there's only one way to find out, right? Keep in mind, I never really came out to my parents, I mentioned to my mom when I was younger I liked guys but I never really said “Hey I’m gay”, and they always say “When are you going to get a boyfriend/ girlfriend”.  
  
Ok, this is the end of my rant, thank you for listening, I just need to get this on paper and get it out there.

I do no longer have physical reactions to my emotions. I get no response in my body. I am just thinking my emotions it feels like. 

Before i had such strong physical reactions to emotions. I miss it. Now it feels like i have no emotions at all. 

I just Feel kind of dead inside. 

I look around and i know it is beautiful, but there is no reaction. 

I Feel extremely disconnected from everything and everyone, and extremely lonely because of this. 

I Feel my emotional reaction just burned out really. One body part after another stopped responding in relation to emotions. 

Sometimes i get stronger emotions, but then i cant Feel them in my mind/mentally. And i dont know why i get the emotion. I rarely get extreme emotions which force me into crying / being angry but i don't mentally feel them idk how to explain it ""it's like i am a shell of a human from the outside it looks like I feel emotions but when I focus on it I am faking all of my emotions subconsciously because they are just a part of my mannerism"" it's like i act angry when I am annoyed but in reality I am not angry.. it's like a reflex 

I have even lost my inner world/head space. I cant Feel it anymore. I used to love daydreaming and would think about everything. Now my head is quiet. I cant Feel my space there anymore. It is gone. It gives me so much anxiety and brings on more obsessive thoughts and actions. 

All senses are dimmed. Smell, taste, vision, touch, hearing. It is all off and of less quality. 
My sense of existence is dying I don't feel like doing anything and my hunger is non existent I only feel hunger when I am starving (after of not eating 24 to 32) I don't even feel thirsty untill I am dying of thirst i can't focus on anything I don't feel pain no more I feel like a sychopath but I used to feel heavy emotions before nothing ""bad"" ever happened to me idky I am like this I am done this makes me kind of sucidal cuz I miss being able to feel.
 
And i used to feel other people's emotions I don't feel them anymore it's like i am deaf I just understand their emotions I have lost all sense of morality wtf is going on with me?

I didn't know these before the relationship started and when I found out I broke down and had a panic attack because I already had trust issues. As I know him more and more, I realized that he seeks validation from strangers. I talked to him about his insecurities and made it clear that I'm not okay with him flirting with strangers even if nothing happens eventually. He denied having insecurities and him seeking validation from other people. But recently he admitted to me that he seeks it. I just tried to comfort him, told him he doesn't need to do this. I am giving and I will give all my love and affection to him as much as possible. He thinks that since I love him, I'm not being objective about him. And when a stranger compliments him, it's more real. I told him I am always completely honest with him and that I think strangers can't truly know who you are so it's not valuable. But if someone who knows you well still stays with you and even love your flaws, it's more special. I don't know why but I think this didn't make him change his mind. I can't trust him, I want to talk to him about this once our schoolwork gets easier because I don't want to make him overwhelmed about something didn't happen (i hope).

I met my best friend cousin online, she is from Ecuador and Im from Mexico, we started chatting and flirting even though she had a boyfriend.
She left her country and boyfriend to come to Mexico for a couple of months.

I'm from a small town, really small, 100 people in my town, so we know practically everyone. When we were chatting she told me we can be friends in public and lovers in secret, and I accepted that thinking it was normal. When she came to my town, we started hanging out, on dates, vacations, we were hooking up almost everynight.

One night i was cooking for her, and she asked for my phone to see our vacation photos, little did i know she went to my WhatsApp and instagram messages, she read a conversation with my female best friend saying everything thing that happened (sexual activities), she got mad saying I disappointed her and she can not trust me anymore. We figure it out, but she wasn't the same anymore, we would still hung out, making out. One day I had to take a double shift and she had the afternoon off, she hung out with another guy and went to eat to his house, she came back at 11:30PM, she said there is nothing wrong with that and I got mad because we are ""dating"" and she shouldn't be alone with a guy in his house at 11:30PM, she told me she doesn't trust me because of the messages with my best friend. She left me for this dude.

I helped her come to mexico, i bought her a lot of things, i helped her emotionally when she needed me the most, i cuddled her for hours while she was crying.

My problem is that every little task such as brushing my teeth, taking a walk, making food, showering and changing the sheets etc. Are SO EXHAUSTING, in a mental way.

We realized that I had since mental health problems a few years back and I've been trying to get help and get diagnosed since then. 

There are a lot of problems but the main one has always been my frustrations with things and my problem to regulate how angry I get. Among since other things.

We've tried so many things to get it to stop. We've talked, taken pills, seen doctors, everything. But it's just recently we kind of understood where the frustration and stuff comes from. I'm probably autistic and have borderline.

We've realized that I've had really huge problems with understanding stuff during my life and problem with learning lots of stuff people need to cope and function. 
I having a really hard time picking up the positive and his things life offers and have rarely grown from any event. 

My mental state seems to still be around teenage years although I am highly functioning. 

The frustrations and arguments has really taken a toll on my ex and me but we're still trying to fix anything between us to at least be friends. 

Lately, last few months we've been trying to get me to remember lots of the bad stuff I've done and said to try and learn from it. I'm really trying my hardest but I'm so frustrated. I've never felt this bad in my life and I still can't change my frustration. 

Its worse than ever. And my ex keeps telling me all the bad things over and over again. I get it, I need to hear it but by now it's driving me crazy. I don't know what to do anymore. 

I want to learn, grow and be better. I really do. I hate feeling and acting like this. But hearing what I've done is killing me and not helping in the slightest.

I'm gonna contact a psychiatrist tomorrow and take things from there but I'm so frustrated tonight and I don't know what to do.

-strawberrylizard-,My mom is living in filth due to mental health and idk how to help her ,1,1c41c24,0,"I am no stranger to mental health struggles, I have PTSD, depression, and OCD myself and there's definitely been times when my mental health impeded my ability to do things like keep my home clean but this is next level.
In 2022 my partner and I bought a double wide trailer and moved it onto my mom's property, we did this so I wouldn't be completely alone when my partner is at work because I have POTs and CFS and get pretty bad presyncope and fainting episodes. We thought it would be better to have family close by who could check on me and make sure I'm doing ok or come help me if something happens.
Basically the whole reason we picked this location for our trailer was to help me with my worsening disability.
We had not visited in my mom in person for 6 or 7 months prior to moving onto her property, although I did talk to her pretty much daily on the phone the state of her home was never mentioned. I was absolutely horrified to see when I walked in that the house didn't look like it had been cleaned in months, there was dirt, dog hair, old food, and grime accumulated on every surface.
The drain pipes in the kitchen and bathroom had also completely broken off and she is catching the water in moldy disgusting buckets and emptying them outside or in the toilet. Everything under the sinks is completely saturated with mold. 
2 of the windows in the house are also broken and covered with cardboard and plastic. 
This was especially confusing because my mom makes decent money, she could afford to fix the plumbing and windows and when I asked her why she hadn't she said it's because she doesn't want someone in her house to do it.
I figured she was probably embarrassed by the state of the house but I've cleaned it up multiple times since then and she claims every time she'll call a plumber and a repair guy for the windows but never does it. She finally admitted it had nothing to do with the mess and she just doesn't want people in her house and never had any intention of calling anybody she just lied to make me ""shut up""  about it.
Her 2 dogs are also filthy and disgusting.
She loves her dogs, honestly to the point I think it's a bit obsessive and unhealthy how dependent on the dogs she seems to be, she doesn't want to go anywhere without them to the point she constantly misses important family events and holidays if she can't bring the dogs. But she is still neglecting them and it makes no sense.
Their nails are horribly long to the point they're probably painful for the dogs, they hadn't been bathed in years, and their breath smells like something died in their mouths, they're also morbidly obese because my mom constantly feeds them things dogs shouldn't have like cake and ice cream. 
I have given them baths a couple of times but I can't do anything about their nails as the dogs are huge and horribly behaved and will bite if you touch their feet.
I feel bad for them but don't know what else I can do as I don't have the money to hire a grommer or take them to the vet myself.
As for the house itself, I'm the only one cleaning it with the help of my partner. 
The whole point of me moving here was supposed to be to take off some the load from me and now I'm maintaining two houses instead of one at determent to my own health.
My mom doesn't lift a finger to help and usually actually complains about what we've done when we clean for her.
She also denies having any mental health struggles and will not see a doctor despite that she's clearly struggling, and often talks about death and not wanting to be here anymore.
I've cried everyday about this situation for over a year and I don't know how to help anymore.
Any advice on what I should do or even can do would be greatly appreciated.

ragwon,Memory loss due to bad mental health ,2,1c3vu9r,2,"I've started realising that after going through a long phase of bad mental health, you start having these memory losses. If someone asks me or tells me something from my childhood, I am unable to recall most of it. I can only recall instances which I have repeated many times in my mind by recalling them. Today I read a question on Reddit to recall an instance where you came out of your cowardice and handled the situation but I was unable to recall any such instance. Although, I rarely confront people cause I'm a people pleaser and kind of a coward but still there have been instances where I have shown courage and confronted the people.

anonpingu,Why can't I be free from the pills and function healthy? I keep relapsing... I am so tired.,2,1c3vu0p,8,"I (26F) have been on so many pills and therapy the last 8 years of my life. And I am still so so so unstable. I am feeling so sorry for myself, using all these pills for so many years like a testing animal. And still, I can't cope with anything. I had depression, anxiety, ocd. I had long lasting therapies, so many months with pills (antidepressants, sedatives, stimulants)... **(Mirtazapine, Alprazolam/Xanax, Fluvoxamine, Ritalin, Concerta, Paroxetine, Vortioxetine, Mexazolam/Sedoxil, Sertraline/Zoloft, etc.etc....)**

Some periods, I get better due to some pills or something exciting happening in my life. But then I'm down again. The last a few years, I started to feel less intelligent, with worse memory. I feel like I'm losing myself.

A few months ago, with my doctor, we thought I beat my 3rd depression. We quit antidepressants because I have been feeling amazing for so many months. I have been using those pills for more than a year so that I don't relapse. But I'm very unstable again due to some problems happening in my life which left me with anxiety induced nausea, cryings, muscle tension, body trembling, bad dreams every nigth etc. He gave me some new pills for generalized anxiety (**Pregabaline and Mexazolam as S.O.S.**) but they don't work. And I am so sick and tired of pills. 

I feel like I will never get rid of this mental illness that I'll always be like this. But I can't function and get my life together like this. I don't want to be a pill addict. 

I just don't know what to do and living alone in a foreign country doesn't help me. I'm feeling so lonely. I have a long distance boyfriend (in another continent ). I call him, I call my family (in another country), but I think they are also tired of me being sad or anxious all the time.  I still see my therapist for 2 times a month (which is already very expensive for me) but I really think that it's not working anymore.

I have a habit of being very emotional but masking everything so most of the time I’m like a robot saying learned responses. When I be myself or let people into my true emotions it starts going downhill like I’m too clingy or sensitive. Outside of a professional environment I don’t seem to function 
I’ve always felt like I’m an alien and different but not in a quirky way.  

Other “weird” things I do when I’m not masking (which is rare I’m always making and exhausted by this) are making weird noises or rubbing my hands, skin picking, I can’t handle change well at all, bad sensory issues (light,texture,noise). 
I have short lived hyper fixations. 

So here is an example of a situation 
two days ago i was with my 19M friend that I am letting live in a duplex on my property. 

Anyways so we were in the car and as a joke I said “if I was super rich I sue people for fun especially corrupt doctors or drs that rip people off, like this one dr I had who gaslighted me about my condition, even if I didn’t win it would still be satisfying to put her through 3 weeks of hell in court.” 

Now I just said this without thinking this through I wasn’t being serious and I’m nowhere near rich. My brain kinda wasn’t functioning and I wasn’t thinking of literal suing. More like in TV shows where they yell I’ll sue u. I was a little serious about the gaslighting dr one.  

Anyways he gets mad and says thats horrible and I’m just like (Bob fake name). The medical situation with the dr included a month of excruciating pain and bleeding that she didn’t take seriously. Now it might be blood cancer.  

Now my boundary is we don’t talk about (bob). A little context (Bob ) is a man who not related to me but basically destroyed my family and hurt my grandmother who has dementia. He tried to steal her stuff isolated her basically abused her. So I had to go through court with him to get my grandma to safety. And not to mention the literal physical destruction he brought to our house that we can’t even sue him for since he has no money. He broke my family apart. I have a small family. He also most likely gave my grandpa Covid and grandpa died. (Bob) person also was disruptive ans disrespectful at my grandpas service. 

So I avoid this topic bc I have a PTSD meltdown and panic attacks. Roommate knows this. Still said it. I melted down. He eventually said we should stop being friends and I’m too sensitive. 

Now he might be friends but wants space from me and I’m confused why. I apologized I did everything i could think of and I am giving him space. I still don’t see the issue with my joke. I usually mimic people’s joking style but this time I didn’t. And he does say out of pocket things. 

Emotions confuse me heavily. Like if someone’s mad I’ll think they are gonna be mad at me forever.  

I genuinely do not want to hurt people. Sometimes I need to verbal vomit stuff like that idk. I’m just sad and it’s only reinforcing the belief that I can never make friends.  ",1713105652.0,

I try and talk to my mom about it.  But everytime the conversation just devolves into her listing all the good things she's done, call me ungrateful, and that I need to ""choose happiness"". Citing like self help gurus and shit (which pisses me off in a a special kind of way).

Well he gave me two pills of oxazepam, I never tried any medicine or drugs of that kind.. I wanted to share my experience here maybe?

I took the first one right after I got out of the doctor's office, I was shaking, almost crying, couldn't see straight or think clearly, everything was spinning, I had to take the bus home, and after about 30 minutes, while on the bus, I very suddenly feel my heart stop racing, it was such a weird experience of feeling it just.. stop, i stopped shaking and my thoughts.. kinda just got deafened, they weren't as present, and there weren't as many - after some hours I just felt a bit tired but not as anxious, and even had a easy time going to sleep for once.

Then at 4am this morning I woke up and.. I just had to take the second pill that instant, I was shaking again, my nervous system was on high alert for no reason at all, I couldn't relax, I paced around in circles a few time debating if I should save it for later in the day, but I decided against it, and then went back to bed, actively feeling the calming effects once again.

For me, this manifests as my entire self-worth hinging on how much ""value"" I bring to people, whether it's loved ones, employers, etc. This looks like overworking myself, constantly worried about how I'm being perceived, excessive gifting, and in general going above and beyond. I'm so tired and this behavior builds up resentment when it's not reciprocated with appreciation, but really, it's my own doing.

A bunch of things contributed to this - parents with unmanaged mental health and substance abuse issues, verbal and physical abuse, love feeling conditional to my achievements, the pressure that society (particularly from the 80's and 90's) placed on girls in particular.

jvnolyn,Am I negative or is it the truth?,1,1c3z37k,0,"(Backstory)
This past school year my attendance has been slim to none due to my depression getting more severe. I had gotten worried with myself because school has always been “my thing”. It’s to the point where I will more than likely have to do summer school. 

I told my friend about this and he told me I was thinking too negatively about the situation. (???) I’m not sure what led to me saying this but I had told him, “it doesn’t matter anyways, whether I fail or pass I’m gonna end up working a 12 hour shift for the rest of my life”. He then just kept on telling me I wasn’t understanding how there’s more to life and that I shouldn’t think so negatively.

(Question)
Is it bad I didn’t see anything wrong with thinking like that? It’s just the truth of life, it’s either graduation, college, and job or graduation then job or those steps leading to becoming a housewife.

I simply don’t see the joy in any of these situations, even if there are those “little moments in life where everything seems right” is that all we have to live for? Those 15 minute moments every so often? That just doesn’t seem like a life worth living. I’m not suicidal or anything, I just simply don’t understand why I would try so hard for a life not worth a penny of satisfaction.

SeaCaterpillar1603,"THINGS THAT MADE MY ANXIETY GONE, WHAT HAVE I CHANGED AND I FEEL HAPPIER THAN THE PERIOD BEFORE I HAD ANXIETY",2,1c3tzf2,0,"Hello friends, as you can see from the title, I will explain how I got better during this whole process and how I realized and understood what I did wrong and WHY it was wrong, in a way that will explain it well and not be too boring.

DISCLAIMER: I can't tell you what to do, maybe you are already doing these things, or maybe there is another problem, I don't know, but maybe you can try these things, they worked for me;

1. Giving up sexual immorality and fixing the issues of relationship and love in my mind: I commited myself to the woman that I was in a situationship with,because I’ve realized situationships and also things such as open relationship and playing hide and seek,hot-cold relationship are harmful and should be avoided. Any non-serious situationship and sexual immorality other than a named,commited,serious relationship is harmful. 

I learned the sexual function of the Oxytocin and Vasopressin hormones, so whether it is pornography, sexual fantasies that are over the top kinky and humiliating,probably even performed  to somehow ""mark"" the partner, whether it is cuckolding or trying to distant yourself with force because of fear of abandonment, whether it is talking to others while seeing someone,in short anything that can signal polygamy, cheating and cuckoldry into our subconscious,are pretty harmful.

Unless there is a committed relationship, there should be no half-assed person at all, and we should have as little history as possible sexually, stay away from himuliating and bad memory marking sexual fantasies, and have open communication about more innocence and love, and not create unnecessary pain and longing, 

I realized that such things are not jealousy or insecurity as todays post modern liberal media and feminism says,but a healthy relationship outlook.

2. Quit all kinds of drugs (yes,including weed), sugar, caffeine,nicotine and alcohol and stop seeing them as cool: Drinking these may not have caused any problems in the past, but after Covid and its vaccine, our body may have started to react more sharply to them due to some inflammation.

Just because those things didn’t affect me before,doesn’t mean they can’t be the cause,who knows maybe I got more conscious due to covid.Or like I said in the first place,they are just feeding the inflammation caused by the covid. I would say don't keep doing the bad things you used to do, who knows, maybe Covid or its vaccine didn't cause any problems, the thing that caused problems is that you gained awareness during the lockdown.

In any given scenario,these things aren’t good.

All these things are also constantly making you release dopamine which can inevitably end up in dopamine wornout.But don’t worry,neuroplasticity will replace those neurotransmitters with new ones.

PS: Cocoa has four times more caffeine then coffee beans,keep that in mind ;)

3. Socializing and having a job: I realized that socializing is not an addiction or needyness, on the contrary, it is something that should be in human nature. Likewise, having a job and earning money is not a bad thing,humanity always worked throughout his evolution,so helping with a load in a community sure helps.Just make sure the job youre doing is ethically sound and really needed for society,but even if you can’t find such job open,if you don’t need to work because you’re economically stable,then I say try to come up with something that can benefit humanity in most ethical and moral way.

But if you’re someone who needs to work or financially supported by a parent even though you’re finished college,go get a job and earn some money.Even if you reject the whole idea of work,there’ll still be microphones and cameras needed to explain your propaganda,so not all works are bad,even if you’re an anarchist.

4. Stopping watching music and movies: Both in terms of the effects of these things on brain chemistry and the messages they signal to our subconscious and the mood swings they cause which is pretty unnatural to our evolution due to the fact that they’re pretty new,I was indulging in those things too much, like a drug in a way, and every drug creates anxiety.

I felt like if I didn't make music, I didn't deserve the woman I was in situationship at that time and it would be my fault if she left me; both because I was abandoned in the past and I myself did abandon someone,and unfortunately,when I connect the dots (which you should do top,just make sure you’re connecting the right dots) these events were seeded because of the simplification of relationships brought by this whole post-modern society.

But then I realized that if someone does not love me for what I am not by what I can offer,doesn’t matter whether it’s money or music,cars,houses or albums or movies, it is unnecessary to play stupid games and purposefully torture myself to starve myself of clarity in our relationship and communicate more daily instead of the once in a month we were doing because of I wasn’t a rockstar yet.(I know it sounds too cringe,but I’ve gotta tell the truth) 

I realized these were childish things when compared to the possibility of real,unconditioned love.

6. I started to dream things that would actually help others: Rather than dreaming about personal pleasures,which I often did by playing an album and dreaming about how I,myself and I would be the niche-cult favorite-lore king cool.

It was all rooted down to my past abondance,then-current situationship where I was afraid to make a commitment and ask for commitment,my long before girlfriend and how we handled things in our intimateness and how degrading it was;and my way of coping with all of this big mesh by forcing myself to believe that open relationships,being careless,seeing love as neediness and lame,being alone as a virtue and anything else as compulsiveness was pretty against our human nature.

We shouldn’t hate human nature,everything is there because of a cause,we should understand it and execute properly.

Even anger has a place,if it wasn’t so then the evulition would diminish it.

We just have to handle them properly (Not in the sense of diminishing them or manipulating them,just be more conscious of them and use them to our fullest potential and avoid the harms that might occur if executed wrongly)

7. I have given up superstitions: And the belief that the universe's purpose is to teach me a bad lesson by beating me up with weird laws of attraction and the like.

But I’ve gotta say,I understand that traditional wisdom was also real and they weren’t jusf pre science era dummies who just supposed things,they were the one’s who did their science by trial and error,and transferring their scientific results by telling tales and writing religious books.

So the thing that they refer to as spirit,might just be psychology.Different names,same thing.

8. I stopped keeping silent and not making criticism : I realized that we can be good by speaking out and discussing together, instead of keeping silent about people's situations and abandoning them,

I realized arguing is not a bad thing, on the contrary, it is better not to remain silent to preserve momentary peace over the real peace which is forever.

9. I understood the importance of sexual morality: And how men and women should behave and take responsibility regards to their chastity, 

And starting to act like a father/mother even if they were not going to have children. The reason for this is that it is in our nature to have children,and this might be the basis of what is called love and peace,this might be the reason of humanity’s longing for peaceful and organized environment,because of the well being of their offsprings.The whole notion of empathy might be flowering from there.

So a life that proposes a proper family structure might help,it did help in my situation.

And even if one hasn’t found the one,thinking about their partner in future and acting accordingly,which means not indulging in any sexual activity before settling down with someone,not being flirty with people all the time all around,and acting as if everyone will find his/her spouse one day so not making loose interactions with people around him/her.

Even if one wants to remain a celibate,not messing around and taking responsibility of sexual interactions by avoiding them.

10. I became vegan, I try to be compassionate against everything: I know this one might be impossible for you if you have serious health conditions,but all I can say is please try to minimize as much as you can in terms of your needs and wants.

And even if you must eat meat,please obtain it from a grass-fed grass-finished sources.

I'm careful not to crush ants even while walking.Compassion for others might give you the love you wanted,or even you can give that love to yourself.

I know the phrase “To love others you must love yourself first” which is true,if you’re an humanity hating person it would be pretty hard to love anyone or anything,let alone yourself.

But sometimes,in order to love ourselves,we must love others first.Sometimes it’s the other way around.

11.Whenever something,some word,some thought triggered me,I asked myself these questions: What did I see when I had an attack as a result of a trigger? What could my subconscious be trying to tell me? What is it signaling? What kind of a moral rule might this represent,did I have violated that rule myself,now or in the past ? What is it that I see and why is it disturbing? And how can I make that thing disturbing? I realized that I needed to take a closer look and see what my subconscious was actually trying to tell me.

12. I did intermittent fasting : Still doing it pretty often,both to prevent overeating and causing a constant dopamine hit in my brain chemistry and to consume less juice in general.

13. I fasted and did one meal a day: So that if there was any anxiety-producing or anxiety-promoting bacteria in my body, it would go away.

14. I made my sleep regular, and I didn’t only in terms of getting enough sleep, but in natural hours,the natural cycle, that is, I prioritized sleeping 8 hours at the right interval rather than just sleeping 8 hours from 6 a.m to 2 p.m

15. I did dopamine detox: You can see what is explained in more detail on the internet. I did this to accelerate Neuroplasticity.

,I feel like i am a lifelong sociopath and am just realizing it,1,1c3yrzc,0,"(M29)
Im not sure if this is due to past trauma but ive never felt like my head was screwed on straight. 

Trauma including: child of divorce, alcoholic mother (sober for 20+ years)
Both parents financially unstable
Exposed to multiple deaths at young age,
Victim of sexual assault, undiagnosed attention issues. probably other
Things i cant think of now.

All of this has made relationships difficult. My whole life i have felt like i have had to pretend to be someone else to fit in. As a child i was very good at adapting to whatever the circumstance warranted. I had a close group of friends that were all very different and I was able to conform to their likes with ease. I was well liked by most kids. I always was a favorite with their parents as well. I have been told that i am very mature for my age. Yet, in my heart i knew this was masking. I also always knew how to manipulate situations to my benefit wether good or bad outcomes. I never saw this behavior as malicious. I remember the moment i realized what kind of person i was. As a teenager i came upon the movie, The Talented Mr. Ripley. It sickens me that i identify so well with this character. Like a chameleon he is able to change his personality to his benefit. I dont think i have any inate talents. Some people are natural athelites. Some are great technical minds. I am a professional copycat. I can sing very well. But i cant write lyrics. I can cover almost any song on guitar but do not have my own music. I am quite handy but i cant build anything from scratch. I am a jack of all trades master of none. 


I am also a very apathetic person. I am married going on 5 years now with 2 beautiful children. I like to think i am generally happy. We have a healthy relationship, are financially stable, and have a close friend group on both sides.  My wife always talks about things that happened to random people at her job and i could not care less. If they are not in my circle, they might as well not exist. Although i can act selflessly, it is not often this happens. I often think about what other people think of me. I imagine them being creeped out by my behavior when i dont see any problem. I have been told i can be intense and a hot head. I often get frustrated by people. I think everyone is an idiot. Ive taken to calling them NPCs (non playable characters.)

I have even gone to lengths of telling my daughter when in our local grocery store, ""always assume that everyone in here is an idiot."" I dont want that mindset for her. I hate that i have told her that. 

I consider myself a realist, which people often equate to pessimism. I just see things how they are. The glass is not half full or half empty. Its just a glass of water.

I have ADHD and dyslexia but never got diagnosed with them because how the fuck can I in this economy. Being unable to stop excessive obsession and struggling with things related to language like spellings, reading and explaining things to people or simply putting thoughts into words no i am simply incapable of doing that. I JUST WANNA DIE because earth before and after I existed doesn't change. My existence only causes more problems for everyone or even myself and now I can't find anyone who can understand.

Not without difficulty along the way she’s made huge bounds in managing her anxiety, but still has days where she struggles with particularly anxiety which also feeds into another layer of depression.

I had a community up and leave out of nowhere for me. They backtalked in my family's face as soon as I got out of home to college. I tried to simply ignore them and now I just feel resentful for people who do things like this. I had strong feelings against back talkers in the first place.

 My mom has PSP, so basically Parkinsons+emotional Alzheimers. (Link to explain if the comparison isn't good enough: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6096-progressive-supranuclear-palsy) The wailing at nights didn't stop for about 2 years. I was a primary caretaker for her during parts of day because I was dual enrolled and my dad was at work. (he later transitioned primarily to home). 

I also had a counselor who sucked at their job in HS so I ended up doing the jobs of like at least one other grown man during my last year. It was so bad that he wasn't getting legally required paperwork processed.

I got to college and I love what I'm doing, but school is challenging (which is fine). But I had a random roommate who just is baseline frustrating.

I feel like I don't have a place to live, and I tried to talk to him. I got him to buy headphones and now he has decided not to wear them anymore, for some reason.

I do not want to take care of a person like they are a nuisance. I do not want to have to train my roommate to not constantly ""borrow"" my stuff. I do not want to have to train my roommate to not play Tiktok at full volume

I feel like I don't have a place to live and regretfully I have another random next year. I can't room with classmates due to goofy scheduling things and them living off vs me living on campus.

There's not really a whole lot I'm looking forward to either. I'm single as all hell, most my friends are busy, and I'm just going home to work a random summer job.

I am just so. freaking. done.

Does anyone have any advice? These things just keep building up and now I'm just agitated and it's running into other areas of my life. I don't want to be angry. I understand that it's natural to be that way considering everything, but I don't want to be angry.

Usually I go through life by taking care of things... but these are not things that can be taken care of in a traditional sense. I just feel stuck and unhappy.

Throwaway_first12,Family Concerns + Future Divorce = Anxiety,1,1c3x7o6,0,"A little backstory. My parents are both seniors, with my dad filing for retirement later this year. His income is going to drop heavily since his contract for this current job ends in June. Unfortunately, he never really planned or saved up anything for retirement and it's already starting to bite him in the ass. My mom is currently looking for work but she does not have enough credits currently to file for retirement. It's a long story but their CPA fucked them over by convincing my dad to not file for my mom separately and just to combine the money she made into his tax filings. My dad is a South Asian immigrant who held onto the social cultures for too long to realize it screwed him over (the whole men should work, women shouldn't need to). I am doing my best to help them look for financial assistance and jobs, built a resume for my mom and gave my dad a template to fill out with his work experience (he still hasn't filled it out due to work due dates). Luckily enough, the city we live in announced they're going to open up Section 8 Voucher applications this year so I'm trying to stay on top of that for whenever they announce the official date.

&#x200B;

My brother married his current wife and they've been together for about a decade. (I""m bad with dates). However, after her father died, she changed into someone completely different. She started becoming more numb but also recently, started flirting with people online. She was caught and when confronted, just froze up. Even her mom called her out on it. My brother wants to do couples therapy but she has not shown any motivation to do so, to the point where she's not even sure if she wants to stay in a single relationship.

&#x200B;

Here's the part where I feel like I'm being completely selfish. My brother plans to move back in with my parents after I move out (lightly apartment hunting now due to a possible lawsuit with my coding camp ISA company, hopefully leads to nullifying the ISA). My fiance and I are looking at some places. However, my brother doesn't have a stable job currently but has experience as a part time art teacher (not state licensed so brought in under a contract) and he has almost 2 decades of experience as an artist and has done commissions for large companies. My worry is that he wouldn't be able to financially help my parents if he moves back in. I live in a pretty expensive state and my parents already don't make much. I always give them what I can to help but after I move out and everything, I won't be able to as much since I'll essentially be having a family to take care of. I gave my brother my resume to use as a template that helped me get my current job and I'm just waiting for him to fill it out so I can edit it after.

This whole combination has been spiking my anxiety and depression for a month non-stop since all this happened last month. I currently take Buproprion and Buspirone for anxiety and used to take Venlafaxine but my cholesterol spiked hard when I was on it. I feel absolutely stuck cause on one hand, I should be supporting his choice leading towards a divorce if things continue. On the other I'm worried about my parents cost of living and my brother not having a stable enough job to help them. And on the third hand, I don't want to stretch myself so thin that I have to financially support myself, fiance, my brother, and my parents at the same time. ",1713111242.0,

KaluSmiga,"Im failing a year at college, how to cope?",2,1c3s7pi,5,"Im 100% failing my second year. It all happend due to depression that started around october..
Some serious self doubt and not feeling enough for anyone. Girlfriend left me, parents dont ever seem proud of me and everyone is still putting expectations on me. Depression hit the hardest because of the breakup. Now its been around 5 months and im healed up from it. But due to my weard collage schedules I'm already failing 70% of classes. I couldn't bring myself to study as i would just wander into depression again and honestly i couldn't even hear or read whatever i was supposed to study. I realized that if i cant focus on studying i should focus on myself. I started focusing on my own happines and started going out more, even alone at times, took a trip with friends, and found hobbies. I have no job but I've had paid scholarship for both years I've been at school. Recently I've had THE talk with my mother where she was furious called me all kinds of names and just made it clear how much of disappoinment I am to her. She knows that I've had mental problems but she thinks that i should show people how much brighter i can shine without them instead of falling apart (indicating the thing about my ex). Which is true but this was my first ever breakup with someone who meant everything to me, so u just couldn't switch 180° and be like okay time to study. 

I dont think the world has ended because im gonna repeat a year, I'm gonna find a job now so by the time next year starts I can pay it all by myself. She says how the money isnt the issue how me being lazy/not interested in life is. 

Im gonna be honest im fine with failing a year, depression is no longer there from the past 5 months. Its just that i dont know how much I'll endure hearing from them about it all. My parents and my siblings. My sister and her husband both finished the same school and course and are working in the industry for quite some time. And its all going to that how my sister finished everything is living the life while look at me i cant do that. 

I think that if i countinued to study while all that depression was on me i would still not pass the year and i would be in a bigger hole then i ever was.

No-Pack3584,I'm absolutely sick of my life ,32,1c3bhfk,14,"I'm at the stage in my life where people are doing normal life stuff and hitting certain milestones in their life. 

I see people getting engaged, getting married, having children. And it really makes me look back on my life, how I am, who I was, what I had to deal with and what I missed out on. 

I'll never have a best friend to call. I dont have anyone to do anything with other than my partner. I'll never join any friendship groups because im ""boring"". I'll never attend a hen party because I have zero friends. I'll never have a hen party because i have no one to attend. I'll never have a normal wedding because I dont have a group of people that love me, not even family. I don't think I'll ever have children because im terrified of being an awful mother, im scared they'll go through what ive been through, im scared they won't have a normal life. I'll never have a birthday party or have friends to call when I need something or have a group of people that love me. I have my partner. I have no one else. 

Seeing people do these things makes me reflect on my life and my current state. It makes me wish I was a different person and picks out all my flaws. I'm unable to be a normal functioning member of society, I can't dance, sing, talk, connect or have any form of attention on myself in groups of people. I sit there and over analyse every movement I make, I kick myself for not being ""normal"" or more fun. When it comes to upcoming events and I tend to think more about how I'll be sat there wishing I could get up and sing, dance, have fun and chat with people. And it makes me so fucking sad. It makes me think about what a waste of life I have and is there any point even continuing. 

Im lonely as fuck, my mental health is increasingly getting worse as I get older. I struggle with depression, anxiety, emotional dysregulation and probably more but my doctor won't help me any further. (I just need to take some pills).

I used to drink and take substances to cope with situations that made me uncomfortable and they used to help with making me appear more normal. I could talk, have fun without looking at myself from the outside. But now I dont drink or take substances, I'm struggling with fitting in. I'm even anxious about drinking in front of other people now and even anxious about being around drunk people. 

I grew up in an emotionally abusive household, had to deal with certain things as a child and its completely ruined me. My father wanted nothing to do with me, his girlfriend was abusive and used to make her children bully/ beat me up whenever I stayed at theirs, she would also come into my room at night and whisper that my father wasn't my father anymore and he was hers, she posted dead animals though our letter box. My mother was judgemental, mean and I was made to feel more like her partner than a daughter, my step dad was a narcissistic abusive alcoholic man. I raised my siblings (I feel guilty about leaving them behind). I experience SA during my childhood and teenage years. I drank alcohol from the age of 13, picked up smoking and started taking substances to cope with things. 

I kind of miss being young, troubled and a mess. Even though it wasn't healthy to be out drinking and doing all those things at a young age and i was surrounded by toxic older people, at least I had fun. I partied, I was messy and I didn't care. 

I had to do awful things to save myself from my childhood home and I had to do things to help me to move out on my own. I was made to feel worthless, stupid, ugly, a slut, a bad person, and so much more in my home. A home that is supposed to be safe. I left and I left everything behind. I dont have friends from school or college or university. They didn't stick around. I just floated from friends or groups but I feel like i was never truly allowed into the inner circle. 

In my 30+ years of being on this planet I have never made life long connections with people. I struggle deeply to let people in and due to my childhood/ teenage years I hung around with awful people. And it really makes me wonder what the fuck have I done with my life. It makes me really reevaluate if life is worth continuing because its so fucking shit. 

I hate seeing posts online about how the challenges we face make us stronger, because it doesn't and that's not the reality. I face daily challenges because of this, its made me weaker not stonger. And im sick of it all.",1713040511.0,

do i really deserve being called those names for what i did? am i really the onlyone responsible for ruining our relationship because of what happened? to me, i was already ruined bc he dumped me out of nowhere thats why it made me make bad decisions. i was ruined for first he was having the best time of his life when we were broken up while i was miserable depressed and fucked up

i feel so miserable right now im back with my self harm thoughts and attempts i could use some advice on how to deal with this. should i open up about this to him even if he tends to be dismissive and deliberately says he doesn't care because he only looks after himself? how should i deal with everything he said? should i blame myself for everything i did and believe him that i ruined our relationship?

Connect_Village_9631,Memory Retention Issues,1,1c3w4z2,1,"Hi, I’m not sure what’s wrong with me. I was with a childhood friend a few days ago, and we have had many of the same life experience but she remembers small details of shows we used to watch, games we played, etc, and I don’t remember any of it. This is a recurring theme in my life. I remember so little compared to everyone else. Another friend asked me what my class schedule was in college, and while I remember the classes, I have no recollection of the days and times. 

I genuinely feel like I remember so little compared to other people and struggle to tell stories because I can’t remember small details and sometimes can’t think of the correct words. This happens to me frequently where I struggle to find the correct word. The rest of my family is very smart, can recall minute details, so it is just me. I feel a lot of anxiety telling stories, worrying I won’t be able to get to the end.

It is extremely frustrating - I’m always trying to better myself and work through it. I tried working out more, eating healthier, reading, but it almost feels pointless because I often can’t recall the details of what I read, whereas for someone else they could spit facts no problem. 

I am very anxious and struggle with mild depression, I take Lexapro, but I feel like a lot of this stems from my memory issues urgh!!! I do frequently have days where I feel unable to communicate properly but forcing myself to try and do so because I feel like a depressive cloud over my head. This happened Christmas Eve Eve, and it was an incredible struggle and I slurred my words a bit at one point. In those moments, I start to think about every word coming out of my mouth, making it more difficult to speak. But I try my best to hide it and most people think I am radiating with positivity. 

I just want to remember the things I experience in detail and be able to communicate as easily as everyone else. I feel so much stupider than my friends and want to have a normal life and tell my posterity the things I did the places I went.

LandIndependent4333,Mind of a Sociopath (ASPD),4,1c3nnv9,1,"ASPD is probably one of the most maligned conditions online. It’s also mis-applied to bad dating behavior, pop-culture characters, and the like. But all of this discourse leads to people misunderstanding the condition and how people, like myself, live. This post exists to show how a Sociopath actually thinks and feels.

For disclosure, I would be described as a more well-adjusted or high-functioning ASPD case. I grew up poor, but had a positive home environment, which I see as the attributing factor towards my adjustment levels.

The biggest misconception is that Sociopathy is the manipulative bad behavior from someone who lacks a conscience; the behavior is not Sociopathy, the lack of conscience is.

But a lack of conscience does not mean bad behavior or the absence of good behavior. One can both be deeply addicted to a drug but abstain from it. Even a disorder like ASPD is not a requirement to behave in a certain way, it’s only a mental wiring to do so. 

I can, and do, choose to be kind to people. But that choice is entirely a cerebral one, I do not experience an emotional reaction to being kind. If I have done something bad I don’t “feel” any guilt or emotional remorse, the impact on someone else isn’t what matters, it’s that I am behaving in a way I don’t want to behave in.

My emotions live within a very narrow range. If I were to describe 1 as the worst feeling on Earth and 10 as the greatest, life stays right at a 4-5 with little day-to-day variation. Intense feelings of joy don’t exist, nor do strong negative emotions other than a general mild disgruntlement.

Things that run through the emotional heart of someone else run through the intellectual part of my mind, I choose to be empathetic but I don’t feel empathy.

In terms of relationships I don’t believe I can experience the actual feeling of a deep bond, but I can maintain a relationship. I see it sort of like how people in arranged marriages probably felt, “I don’t *love* you, but I will do what’s best for us because I love our obligation to each other”. 

I do like children and would like to have them one day, though I question if they’d end up like me due to the heritability of ASPD. I think at a base level I could provide a “supportive” home. I don’t think they’d grow up seeing me as particularly affectionate but they would feel supported, encouraged, and wanted. I imagine they would say “Dad wasn’t really close to us, but he did want us to be happy and wanted what was best for us”. It does worry me to imagine they would be like me and poorly adjusted, but I think that’s more common in bad home environments.

A lack of strong emotional response has been a benefit to my work, I’ve done a number of jobs (military, etc.) that exposed me to significant amount of violence. In a way, I think society relies on people like me who can go see violence day after day without it bothering them.

A lot of what people do automatically because they feel a certain way I do because I choose to be a certain way. Religion has helped this. I don’t truly know why I was afflicted with the inability to feel empathy, but that is the hand I’ve been dealt. A lack of empathy is “me” but an imperfective me.

How to handle sociopaths is a tricky question though… it’s lifelong, but making us outcasts is incredibly damaging too. Not many people want to associate with someone who is diagnosed as a sociopath (ASPD), but should a diagnosis exclude me from having a family? I don’t believe so, it’s action not condition, that should determine things.",1713079110.0,
Ill_Introduction4290,I hate everything so much,4,1c3niy8,1,"Ever since I can remember I've always had to eat everything in sight even if I'm full and making myself feel sick. I hate it. I lost 15kg and achieved a healthy weight but something changed and I couldn't control myself anymore. I know I shouldn't long for when I was also deeply unhealthy when I was starving myself and over exercising. But I feel like I felt better. I want to eat normal, but I just can't. I try everything, writing down everything I eat, calorie tracking, journaling, eating high protein, having 3 meals a day. I know I just eat when I'm bored or depressed yet I still can't stop. I just stop tracking calories because I end up feeling too much guilt and shame and can't even remember everything I ate. I always tell myself the diet starts tomorrow or I'll eat healthy tomorrow but I can't even commit for 4 hours. Why can't I eat normally? I hate myself so much. 

What's worse is nobody knows I deal with this. My binges aren't really massive I guess but its still a lot of food because I am very short. It's not like I crave junk food although I do eat like 4 drumsticks in one sitting if no ones watching.

I know when I feel actually hungry and when I don't but I still just eat and eat and eat. And then my brain gets foggy and I feel tired and sleepy and just can't be motivated to achieve anything. Then I start picking at my skin and getting rashes. Then at night I feel depressed and promise to start again tomorrow but I never do. I can't afford therapy and I don't think I could honestly tell anyone about this anyways. It's weird, most of these stories I read everyone binges at night but I usually eat nothing after 5-7pm but binge mostly in the morning like from 9-2 and then I just stop. I think I need help, none of my friends act like this, sometimes I feel like there is something wrong with me.",1713078600.0,

Mobile-Scar7448,Am I in danger?,1,1c3ui33,5,"

Hello everyone, posting about my neighbour.

My wife and I live in a shared house, with each of our neighbours living in separate rooms with the kitchen and living area being shared.

We have a neighbour which is acting very strange, and I wanted your guys opinion on if my wife and I should move out.

Details of what is concerning is written below:
Probably the main concern is that we feel like whenever we go to the kitchen to prepare our food or eat is a signal for the neighbour to come as well. At first we thought it was just coincidence, but we've been living in the house with him 6 months now and the feeling hasn't changed.

When he does come to the kitchen he usually walks around without a purpose, as though he is trying to get his steps in or something. He doesn't directly interact with us or anything.

We have noted from the corners of our eye that he stares at us when we are not looking. We also saw him staring at the other neighbour when  that guy came in to the kitchen to grab some food from the fridge and didn't say a word.

We noticed that he often smiles so that we could see his teeth, but he isn't listening to anything and isn't looking at his phone. 

While we are in the kitchen having our meal, he could come in several times and going back to his room numerous times (I know it doesn't sound bad but more details written below). 
He comes into the kitchen, takes out a cup and leaves to his room immediately, only to return back in 10 seconds to take something else out and to leave once again. He could do that non stop for 30 minutes while we are eating.

Another point is him needing something when we start using it. He could be standing next to the sink just browsing his phone for 20 minutes, and as soon as we come over to wash our dishes he will remember that he needs it too and put his phone away. This happens so many times.

In general i think the guys has issues with memory and is clumsy. For example we have a roster for taking out the trash, but each time it's his turn he asks us to remind him. 

Once I left the room just to pick something up from the fridge and he followed me as well(not surprised) and I went back to my room as soon as I grabbed what I needed. I looked back curious what will he do in the kitchen only to see him stop as soon as he entered it, switch on the lights, switch them back off, and started going back into his room.

We noted that he stops following us when he thinks we are not friendly to him, but that lasts only for a few days.

On his first night he locked himself out of his own room at 5 am and my wife and I woke up to the sound of him trying to brake the door down to not skip his work. We were terrified and were afraid to leave the room.

Whenever he enters the kitchen, he cover the windows with blinds no matter what time of day it is, so the kitchen is always dark.

He leaves his stuff in the washing machine, without actually starting to wash them. We often ask him to take his stuff out, only to discover that he just started the machine.

Sometimes when I was my dishes he just stands behind me for a long time, which creeps me tfo.

Does anyone know what is wrong with the guy and if my wife and I should move out or not?
We tried looking him up but could find anything.
He told us that he has a daughter in another country, but we never heard him talking with any of his friends or relatives.

The reason why we are staying is because of the contract and the low rent ( living in Perth, Australia which is experiencing an increase in rent prices now).",1713103951.0,
TinyTiger642,How does everyone else do it? How do people survive but I can't?!,1,1c3ugkz,0,"It just doesn't make sense. Everyone lives in the same world but some people cope and some don't. People always say that mental illness isn't a weakness, but it's getting pretty difficult to believe that I'm not just weaker than everyone else in this world. Ive been diagnosed with MDD, GAD, panic disorder and I have chronic insomnia. Why is the world affecting me differently? It doesn't make sense. Also it amuses me how these things work together to destroy my life and world. I don't sleep for three days, so I feel disgusting. The depression makes me want to stay at home. The. The anxiety makes me leave the house for fear of what might happen if I don't. Then I'll end up having a huge panic attack and not be able to move for 24 hours.
Why can't I function like everyone else???

Oh and also, I've started new antidepressants (Fluoxetine) and it's made my anxiety ten times worse and not helped the depression at all
My psychiatrist says that I almost definitely have ADHD but for some reason I can't be officially assessed and diagnosed until I come off other medication, but I can't come off the medication otherwise I'll go insane.

I go through phases but in a particularly bad one at the moment, and very suicidal in the past year or so.

AleXSySt3m,I have a problem with my life,1,1c3ud76,0,"Hi everyone, my name is Alexander, I am 20 years old. This is the first time I ask a question on reddit, but I think there are people here who can help me.
I live a comfortable stable life. I have an apartment from my parents, a girlfriend with whom I live in this apartment. Everything is calm and fine with us. I study at university, and I do not need to work, because my parents have money to provide for me. There are friends with whom I periodically chill, I have TV, good PC and all things that only I need. It's like I have everything. But I'm not happy.
Almost all the time I play games, watch youtube or series, anime, movies (alone or with a girl). This makes me calm and joyful for some time, but not for long enough. Accordingly, in my studies I have low attendance and bad grades, I am on the verge of dropping out. Actually the study itself I am also uninterested, I would like to do in a completely different sphere. But for this I need to make efforts, which I can't make myself, and I don't want to, because it seems to me that there is another way to start doing something. However, whenever I plan to start doing something, I fail to follow my own plan, because I am busy with something else and I don't have motivation to start doing something. Often after that I start crying and my girlfriend calms me down, but of course it doesn't lead to anything. And everything repeats the same scenario: I again do not study, read or do other things that I would like to do and I again after a while suffer because of this and again promise myself to start. I can't get out of this cycle. I went to a psychiatrist, he only said that my condition is very similar to ASD, but still there is not enough data for such a diagnosis. I wish that someone will give me clear instructions to solve my problem, but I don't know what to do to find it by myself. That's why I decided to describe my problem here. I hope that there are people who can help me. Thank you in advance.

 I no longer live with her but since moving out I’ve developed a bit of an obsession with knives.

SlackerSlinky,Need To Get My Wife Back,1,1c3u1ik,0,"I never thought I would be the guy typing the “wall of text” on an anonymous account.  
My wife and I have been together for more than 30 years. Her family has always been a challenge, lots of dysfunction. Not in the physical abuse sense but very much an “everyone ignoring the elephant in the room”, primarily the whole family worked around this dysfunction, regardless of the impact to everyone.  This has caused lots of stress and strain over the years, but our marriage has been great, I don't think we have ever argued, we are totally in sync with each other 99.9% of the time. I gave her latitude with her family and tried to just go with the flow, because it was difficult, I could compartmentalize.   
She has always been very anxious and worries a lot, but that would go up and down. Then came a bike accident where she ended up in surgery for a new collarbone. After that, COVID hit and she was disproportionately worried about that (she eventually got it, but not bad). Then a heart surgery for a valve issue. Tack on a long battle with hot flashes, for years, that has not helped her, and trying to get off of the anti-depressants (for hot flashes, not depression), has been rough. Basically a series of things in her life that I had to spend a disproportionate amount of time talking her through, but that is a spouse’s job.   
We decided to move out of state next year and she will be leaving her late 80’s parents here in town. They swear they will be fine. But neither really is. This caused a lot of strain and things came to a head. They said we are free to go and the family dynamics changed. We’ve been VERY happy about this fresh start.   
Her extended family was all in town and that visit (10-15 days) created a HUGE amount of stress for her. It got to the point that she was turning off all text notifications and not answering her phone. 

In the midst of all of this, she suddenly ""saw the light', she recognized the dysfunction in her family and realized all that I had done in putting up with it for three decades. She said I was too good to her that I should not have had to go through all of this and could not thank me enough. I thought great, she finally had a breakthrough. But then it turned.

I think she had a breakdown. Then she started spiraling downward. She sleeps a lot. She is speaking in gibberish like she is trying to string together a stream of consciousness. Normally a commercial skipper/muter, I just watched her watch an Arby’s commercial at high volume. She got up from the couch and without saying a word to me, went for a walk around the block at 6AM. Then stare up at the street light.  
She says things like “I’m fine”, “I just need to trust the process,” and “If you know you know.” I ask her “what is the process”? She can’t articulate, just “I know what I see.” I ask her what does she mean by these other things. She can’t say.  
For a few days she would admit that things were going on but she could not articulate what is happening. Now she will not even say anything is wrong.   
I highly doubt it is drugs, she does not have that history and does not really go out anywhere. She hasn’t even done her normal gym or yoga that were a huge part of her life. It is not some kind of cult or Qanon or anything like that.   
It is a wholesale personality change. She did begin to engage with her doctor (PCP) and seek a therapist last week, but when I ask about it she’s gone from being over open to “how many times do I have to tell you” without actually ever telling me anything.  
Can a massive stress event like having this family reunion and the whole shitshow that comes with it actually cause such a dramatic night and day personality change and cognitive dysfunction?

Ornate_Kobold,I dont know what I can/need to do anymore.,1,1c3tj2t,2,"Hello, I saw this and thought I'd give a post here a try.

Some background. Im 21, I've struggled with issues at home and mental health since I was a little over 8. Both my parents are separated and out of my life. I grew up being abused in various ways. Ive been in and out of therapy since I was 14, and saw a nurse practitioner, PsyD regularly from 15 to 20.

I had issues with my self image,  anxiety, and depression since I was 8. And after around 12 or 13 I started to see things and hear things other people didn't notice or seem to care at all. I had a lot of issues as well as the older I've gotten the more I began to hallucinate. It all started leading to high paranoia especially as some of the people in my life were also gaslighting me based on my hallucinating. 

My diagnosis always changed and it felt like every visit to the PsyD it was changed or worsening. It went from severe anxiety and major depression to majpr depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms. It eventually went between schizo affective disorder, schizophrenia, and psychosis.

I used to be on government aid and mecical insurance through my old state. I have always been moving in life since we first moved out of my house at 6 I never lived in one house for more than 1.5 years. It was to the extent of moving to a new place every month at one point in life.

I unfortunately came across more housing issues when i turned 18 and during the pandemic I was considered homeless by the state and then on. At 20 my medical insurance stopped and i was never able to get a stable diagnosis for my mental illness.

I did eventually find my current partner online and we started a relationship online. But later on my insurance stopped and any renewal form would not go through as I was disqualified for medical insurance and support woth food. 

Then I kept going through issue after issue with things untill I was able to move to Virginia to live with my partner. Weve been living together with a roomate for the past 8 months and they have been very supportive and helpful with things. I love my partner. They have financially, and mentally supported me through everything so far.

My issue stands now that I do not have any medical insurance, my old ID expired after i turned 21 mid December, and I have been having issues taking care of things on my end.

It has become increasingly obvious to my partner and roomate that I've mentally declined since around late January early February, and I have been noticing it too. 

My partner actively serves in the navy but planning to not stay after their time is up. My partner and I all feel I need to seek therapy and psychiatry. However our finances can not support the bills from that. We are not married so their work will not provide assistance. 

I feel lost and cant keep track of reality sometimes. I can barely stand going out in public due to feelings of people watching me. Reading my thoughts, conspiring at my well-being. I keep hearing and seeing things that nobody else can and my usual methods of coping will not work at all.

I dont know what  need to do to seek help. Is there free or cheap psychiatric support out there? 

I've heard about people with schizophrenia being able to recive some form of government support similar to disability. 

How would I get any diagnosis in my state?

If there is financial support for my condition in my state how would I go about getting it?

For 7 years I've lived with my best friend who had sexsomnia and when it happened I didn't really feel traumatized, most of the nights he did this I found a way to prevent him from actually touching me, but there have been a few fights and sometimes he would wake up and push me back so hard and go back to his bed, curl up and cry himself to sleep. I wasn't angry or frightened or what, he was my best friend and roommate and everyday living with him was so cool I'd forgive what his sleeping version of himself would do. I never considered this like abuse until very recently.

I don't live with him anymore and this didn't happened since 4 years ago now, but everytime I think of him there are the roughest memories popping automatically.  Recently I had a specific memory that came back to surface I had completely forgotten, and since then I think of it everyday And I don't want to sleep close to him ever again. If I have no choice to sleep in a room next to this I'll find it hard to sleep and have nightmares.

I don't want to think of him like this anymore, we still go out and have activities together. I never felt traumatized but it seems my brain slightly is however. I just have automatic annoying thoughts.

Do you think it's worth seeing a therapist for this ? Is it possible that my trauma is being repressed and maybe someday I could just collapse ? I'm quite confused

Bit of background

Weight gain. 

I had a traumatic experience in 2012 and I steadily started gaining weight

I have lost loads of weight and put it all back on plus more at least 3 times in the last 12 years.

I’m now at the heaviest I’ve ever been. I’m almost double the Weight I was in 2008

Death of Parents
My beloved father died from vaccine injury in 2021 and in her grief my mother has developed dementia and alzheimers 

This has really taken a toll on my mental health 

Despite this I held down a retail job until recently (august 2023), I left it because my graphic design business was really taking off and I was struggling with the physical side of retail work 

Since my life has become even more sedintary I hired a PT to come and work out with me 3 times a week at home

Relationship

I’ve been with my beloved partner for 16 years nearly but our intimate life hasn’t been existent for at least 6-7 years

I have tried to reignite it but he’s not interested. I know it’s because of my weight but he swears it’s not

Until recently I trusted him implicitly 

But in December I discovered he was arranging to meet other men for sex and in that instant my entire world collapsed. My trust in him has never recovered

He swears he’s never met anyone and just chatted with them. I believe him because I know him and I don’t think he had it in him to be unfaithful properly. And I’ve given him several opportunities to end out relationship but he says he loves me more than anything

Career

We, along with our best friend had a production company and for the last 8 years have been writing comedy and plays etc.

Since then we have filmed several comedy pilots pushing forward with projects  
We took a show to Edinburgh Fringe in 2022 with our female friend in a one woman show to critical acclaim  
When the Eurovision Song Contest came to Liverpool in 2023 we as locals pushed ourselves to get involved. Our closest female friend was already working for a high level broadcaster in the city and we wanted to use the character we took up to Edinburgh to push our work forward  
Between March and May we banged out 30 videos.  
Unfortunately our friend was experiencing instability in her work and so when it came to gaining access to some of the big Eurovision events she was pained to push anyone and ask. She also wouldn’t allow me to lead the charge on producing as she didn’t want me to Rock the boat. I was essentially castrated in the situation  
We had a big meeting with essentially the commissioner for the entire Eurovision show and left the other promises of huge involvement.  
What transpired was broken Promises, radio silence and I was left with no way of pushing forward on my own with it  
Surprisingly it all went well and we finished the videos and looked forward to Eurovision, no one fought, no one expressed uncertainty.  
After the hype died down and we tried to have another meeting and plan our next move. Our friend said she needed a break. We’d essentially all felt burned out after such a busy few months  
We agreed and planned to come back to it in September  
I had recently introduced her to her new spouse (I had known him since school and he was recently divorced)  
This man spent months buttering me up and getting close to me in an effort to get close to her.  
After they started seeing each other I essentially was dropped like a hot brick. Now I hardly ever hear from him even though he’s dating my best friend  
The relationship quickly exploded and it was pretty evident that they’re the love of each others lives.  
My friend spends all her free time with him and his children and after a recent promotion in work she is in the job she wants now  
My problem is I feel like I’ve properly lost her. We spent years building this company, dozens of ideas, working hard. And she’s now got her broadcasting job and it feels like she’s pulled the ladder up after her and left us to it  
We’ve gone from seeing her twice a week to 4 times in the last 6 months. Any free time she has is spent with him.  
We tried to come back in September but she was ready and didn’t want force it. Essentially saying we would come back to it ‘one day’  
The entire situation has left me depressed, I feel betrayed, sad and like I don’t know how to proceed with my own work.  
The worst part is I’m still friends with her. She has changed beyond recognition though. We hardly ever talk anymore on WhatsApp when we used to chat every day  
I don’t feel like I can tell her how I feel because she will feel like I’m trying to control things  

Existential crisis

As you can see

I’ve really been through the ringer in recent years

Despite this I’m still trying to push ahead with plans for my writing career with amazing opportunities being offered to me

Unfortunately I am exhausted. Physically, mentally. 

I’m almost in a daze most days, dissociative and distracted

I look at the state of the world politically, the threat of wars, pandemics, 

I hear horrendous stories about politicians, celebrities and satanic cults and suddenly now even my aethiest beliefs are now up in the air.

Everything I ever trusted about my own views on religion and life has been shaken 

Every single fundamental cornerstone of my stability is gone and I’m struggling to stay afloat 

I have no drive to push forward with career or weight loss because I honestly don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few years with wars etc. 

It all seems so pointless 

How do I even go on? I don’t have the energy, I’m sleeping terribly of a night time and napping constantly in the day",1713085229.0,
cuevadanos,Non-selfish reasons to seek therapy?,1,1c3sq0s,0,"So I have a therapy appointment next week. I’m looking forward to it because recently I’ve had periods of what feels like depression (intense guilt, sadness, hopelessness etc) followed by periods of happiness, mental stability, and extreme hope (like feeling I’m on top of the world). This has been messing with my head.

However every time I’ve thought of therapy I’ve been hesitant to go for it because I think it would be selfish in my case. A big reason why I feel this way now is because I regret some things I did intensely. There are people who do nothing wrong and still have mental health issues, and I feel like I’m taking resources away from them because I want to feel better.

I would like to know which are some good reasons that are not related to me feeling better that would make it a good idea for me to go to therapy, so I can stop being so hesitant. Thank you!",1713098570.0,

Global_Tear561,"Really struggling with various things, and getting a bit overwhelmed",2,1c3p2o2,0,"First of all: apologies for the long message.  

Backstory: I'm a teacher working overseas.  Overall, my time here has been more positive than negative.  However, last year I got quite burnt out at work and went through an (overall) pretty bad year.  

I had a job interview for a university in another country (which would start in September) last November.  After a long waiting process, I was offered the position.  This is great, however the timing has been quite bad, as where I am the school year starts from April, and I had agreed to another year.  

I was actually leaning towards not re-contracting - knowing that I had a potential job offer elsewhere - but actually the head teacher at my school suggested that I could quit from the summer should I be offered the job.  Normally, it is not good to quit midyear, but he was having some hiring issues - they needed more teachers than usual, and some backed out - and thought it might be beneficial to both of us (he made it sound, in so many ways, like me leaving would possibly put them in a bad situation - though perhaps not explicitly so).  

In my very burnt out (and fairly depressed) state, I agreed to this.  However, now that I have the job offer, I am overwhelmed with everything.  There's not only the new school year to worry about, but also moving out stuff, visa stuff, trying to visit back home etc.  Also, I feel a bit resentful, as my 'leaving bonus' might now apparently be off the table (which the head teacher assured me wouldn't be an issue).  Also, I just feel guilty leaving mid year in general.  

Ultimately, it was my choice, and I have to take the blame.  However,  I feel somewhat used by the head teacher (in order to make his life somewhat easier regarding hiring), and my guilty concious (putting the school in a bad position) got to me.  

I feel very overwhelmed with everything, and sometimes it's a serious struggle getting out of bed.  I'm trying to spend a decent amount of time outside, exercising, limiting alcohol (my social life is a bit lacking unfortunately) but it's really been a struggle.  Also, I no longer look at the head teacher in the same light when at work, which has been tough.  I'm really trying my best to hone my acting ability when at work, but it's been an uphill battle.  I really just want to be done with work (I initially agreed to work until the end of July, but don't think I can do it) and to get on with my life/moving process.  I hate the fact that I essentially might be working for free (in that I may not get a contract completion bonus) and have to leave on a bad note.  

Again, this was my choice, but regardless it's been tough - perhaps I need a real therapist : /

Logical-Passenger-28,How to feel like myself again ?,1,1c3s9oc,0,I have been going through a break up for the past month and I think I’m doing the best I can but I don’t feel like myself anymore. For the past 10 years of my life I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression. I would sometimes have moments like this that I don’t know who I am. But ever since I beat depression I hadn’t had a moment like this. I no longer feel confident and have excitement for the days to come. I want to go back to the person I was a couple of months ago. He was confident outgoing loveable. The other thing is that I feel so alone. I’ve come to realise that even though I have quite a few friends no one is there for me. I don’t have anyone that I can see everyday and hangout. I forgot how to talk to other people and meet new ones since the only thing I’ve talked about the past 2 months is my ex. I miss my energetic fun happy self. I don’t want to be depressed once again. All I do everyday is sit in my room and scroll through YouTube. I’m so tired of this and hate being like this but I don’t know how to change it. I don’t know how to be myself again. I want to hang out with my friends but they are too busy with their lives.

KaluSmiga,"Im failing a year at college, how to cope?",1,1c3s7rq,3,"Im 100% failing my second year. It all happend due to depression that started around october..
Some serious self doubt and not feeling enough for anyone. Girlfriend left me, parents dont ever seem proud of me and everyone is still putting expectations on me. Depression hit the hardest because of the breakup. Now its been around 5 months and im healed up from it. But due to my weard collage schedules I'm already failing 70% of classes. I couldn't bring myself to study as i would just wander into depression again and honestly i couldn't even hear or read whatever i was supposed to study. I realized that if i cant focus on studying i should focus on myself. I started focusing on my own happines and started going out more, even alone at times, took a trip with friends, and found hobbies. I have no job but I've had paid scholarship for both years I've been at school. Recently I've had THE talk with my mother where she was furious called me all kinds of names and just made it clear how much of disappoinment I am to her. She knows that I've had mental problems but she thinks that i should show people how much brighter i can shine without them instead of falling apart (indicating the thing about my ex). Which is true but this was my first ever breakup with someone who meant everything to me, so u just couldn't switch 180° and be like okay time to study. 

I dont think the world has ended because im gonna repeat a year, I'm gonna find a job now so by the time next year starts I can pay it all by myself. She says how the money isnt the issue how me being lazy/not interested in life is. 

Im gonna be honest im fine with failing a year, depression is no longer there from the past 5 months. Its just that i dont know how much I'll endure hearing from them about it all. My parents and my siblings. My sister and her husband both finished the same school and course and are working in the industry for quite some time. And its all going to that how my sister finished everything is living the life while look at me i cant do that. 

I think that if i countinued to study while all that depression was on me i would still not pass the year and i would be in a bigger hole then i ever was. 

Did you have similar experiences and how did you handle it?

Txmless_dreams,I don’t know what to do anymore,2,1c3o2av,1,"
I’m 16, so still young and maybe these are just my hormones but I feel this heavy sadness everyday. It’s overwhelming and I do anything I can from alcohol, smoking, self harm and tobacco to avoid the feeling but I can’t escape it. I don’t even know how to put it into words, I’ve lost all my friends and it’s entirely my fault because I shut down for months at times. Deep down I feel like I don’t deserve anything. My self esteem is terrible and all I want to do is end it all. I just want to get better. I have a psychologist, but all I do is repeat the same things over and over each session. I tell her I’m sad but because I don’t seem sad it doesn’t look like a big deal. I have adhd so I get distracted really easily and I’m quite chatty once I warm up, so because she’s one of the only method of social interaction I tend to blab and I skim over the things that are really bothering me. It makes me realize I avoid all sorts of confrontation against my mental health and it bothers me. I just want to feel okay. I’ve dropped in person learning because my depression gets so bad I literally can’t stand up I don’t even know how to explain it. I just get so sad. I do online school now and it’s the only thing I have left that connects me to the outside world so I’m holding onto it but I can feel the motivation slipping. I’m not trying to make this post for the sole reason of making people feel bad for me, I’m wondering how to get out of this hole/cycle. I don’t know what to do I guess this is a last resort. Since other people on this subreddit know what I’m dealing with maybe you guys know some methods to avoid deeper depression.

Ps I’m not asking for medical advice I’m asking for methods that make things easier coming from people who suffer from depression. If that makes sense.

podzimni_anicka,How to get rid of contamination ocd,1,1c3retx,0,"It’s ruining my social life and making my anxiety worse, I think that it all started after I got attacked (I was 14, it was a year ago), a grown woman slapped me, there was also a man verbally threatening me and all that, I don’t want to go into the details cause i don’t want to remember this, but I’ll just say that I developed ptsd, severe anxiety and a panic disorder, ik that it may sound stupid, I only got attacked so why did it break me so much, but it was more than a small physical and verbal assault. So please don’t ask me how only this could make me feel this way. Anyways, a woman slapped me, I felt the dirt from her hand on my face and I disinfected it a lot (my face), and that was I thought the end of it, to be honest I had diff things to be worried about. Now I don’t have panic attacks and my anxiety is more manageable, but I’ve noticed that in the past couple of months, I’ve been extremely stressed about dirt and germs, I can’t touch anything that I feel is dirty (literally everything, and I mean everything) the only thing I don’t view as dirty is my computer mice and my chair (I disinfect them every day) other than that, I feel like everything is dirty and full of viruses. I never want to sleep at a friends house, don’t want friends over and don’t want to go out, as you can tell this made my social life a lot worse. I hate going to school because that’s the place I feel like is the most dirty, I can’t wear shorts or tank tops or anything like that because I can feel my bare skin touching the dirty chair, table etc. I hate public transportation, I live in Europe, so public transportation is huge here, going to school, going to a market, going basically anywhere means using public transportation. So this made me isolate myself even more and every time I have to go to a bus or a train I get uncomfortable, disgusted dirty, or feel the viruses and bacteria on me and I get a breakdown.

mentlhealth,I don't really know anymore,1,1c3r9i8,1,"Man I don't really know where to begin with whats been going on. I feel like my life doesn't have any meaning and it never will, these past few days I've been rotting in bed instead of actually doing the things I need to do and I've suffer the consequences for it. My grades are rapidly dropping (I mean they weren't ever good to begin with but at least I got C's now all I get are D's and F's) And my family has decided to hate me for it. I don't feel like anyone really likes talking to me, it feels like every interaction I have with people is fake and artificial. I think I have autism since I've always felt different from the people around me and I've never felt like I truly belong somewhere. Every night I imagine what my brains would look like on my wall if I shot myself in the face. I also don't feel like I can ever do anything that makes anyone happy, everyone around me is all sad and gloomy and it effects my mood too. I've started so many projects that I never got to finish, like my mural that I started drawing on my wall which never even got to 30% completion or my youtube videos which I've scrapped or my numerous writing endeavors that went nowhere. I also have a very hard time trying to get a girlfriend, I mean I've been trying to get one for the past 3 or 4 years but it never seems like I get close. There was this one girl who I really liked and we had been texting on instagram for like 5 days in a row for over 2 hours each day. This got so far that I even scheduled a date but 2 or 3 days before the date I had to ruin it, cause I called her crazy as a joke, but it seems that she didn't take it as one, and I've been left on seen for the last 2 months, and even after I apologized with all my heart she still didn't reply and I think that bridge is already burnt. After a while of thinking I've come to the realization that I fall in love with every girl I meet, every girl no exceptions. It doesnt matter what they look like or how they act I just can't not fall in love with them and it hurts because theres this one girl that I have no chance with because she's 4 years older than me. She's the most beautiful girl I've seen in my entire life and I absolutely love her. I love everything about her, her smile, her face, her eyes, her hair, her body, her voice, the cute little sneezes she does but she keeps flirting with my other friends that are her age but never with me. And today me, her and another friend were walking and her and the friend held hands and I just walked behind them like a third wheel and It didn't feel nice, it felt very shitty and my head is a mess. Theres this other girl who I see at a bus stop I frequent and I finally managed to work up the courage to talk to her but then I don't know how to start conversations so even though I have her instagram we only talked once and I cant work up the courage to talk to her again. These past few years I've been floating around sort of like a ghost cause I haven't been able to get anything done, and all I do is sit on my computer and play video games instead of actually doing something productive with my life. Last year around june my father got cancer and I didn't find out about it till november of the same year. And yes the fact that he has cancer makes me sad but its so stupid that people act kind now when they know that my dad has cancer but when they see that I'm not doing well they don't really care. I feel really shitty admiting this but my father having cancer isn't something that makes me the saddest I can possibly be, it isn't even the saddest thing I'm currently experiencing as I think that I've never been happy my whole life. Yeah I smile every now and then and yeah I laugh here and there but I can't think of a time when I have been genuinely happy to be somewhere. I also feel a lot of guilt because when I was in kindergarten I tried to kiss a girl I liked while she was sleeping and I know that at such a young age I didn't know any better but to this day I haven't recovered from that and I still feel like a walking piece of shit because I did it. I also feel an indescribable loneliness which has been with me since the 1st grade. In 1st grade I used to get bullied so much that I would come home with bruises and that only stoped in the 4th grade. But I still didn't have any friends until one kid from my class befriended me and introduced me to his friends and we really hit it off and I felt like I was part of their group and to this day they're still very dear friends of mine, but we've grown distant and I fear that our friend group will melt like butter on a hot stove and we won't talk anymore. In the 7th grade the bullying started again and it was the worst it had ever been because it wasn't just physical but also mental. And at that time this friend group that I just talked about also made fun of me and it was horrible cause I was the laughing stock everywhere I went and its still exactly that way. Couple that with my parents also becoming abusive and not caring for my mental health and my sisters always backing them up on whatever they said and I was starting to feel like I was going to go insane. I then went on to highschool and it seems like the bullying follows me everywhere I go. They still make fun of me even though I'm in a comepletely different class with completely different people but they just won't stop making fun of me for some reason. I don't even do anything I just keep quiet and draw so I don't understand why they're making fun of me. They say that I smell bad or that I have greasy hair even though I shower every day. I'm soon going to be transfering to art school and hopefully being happy there but who knows what will happen. With art comes the fact that I'll probably be poor when I grow up and become an adult so of course I feel incredible anxiety at the realization that my life is probably not going to amount to anything. And i just want to say some more about the girl I like who's 4 years older than me. I think that my love for her is fruitless for it will amount to nothing because if I ever confess (which I never will because I confessed to a girl in the 6th grade and she didn't ever talk to me after that) her answer won't be a yes because she'll think that this whole time I've just been acting like her friend just to get into a relationship with her but I really do love being her friend. She is smart and likes the exact same stuff I like. Books, movies, games, shows, music, she is willing to listen to everything I say and she too has had a rough abusive life up until now and all I want to do is just hug her and tell her that it'll all be alright but I know that I can't do that. On top of all of this I feel really shitty since my imune system has been sort of lacking lately and I'm very sick. I think I suffer from depression and adhd and anxiety and autism but I can't really say for sure since I'm too scared to go to a psychiatrist since I find them kind of scary. I mean they would know everything about my life and I feel like thats just too much trust to put into a person. I know that its going to get better but I've really started to doubt that cause I've been suicidal for the past 3 or 4 years and it hasn't gotten any better. I also feel like I'm not really good at anything, my arts mediocre, I'm shit at video games and I don't succeed whenever I put my all into something. I recently got a pet bird for my birthday but he seems to not like me whatsoever even though its been a couple of months.

notsofriendlyuser,I have the feeling that something is wrong with me. Am I a high functioning depressed?,1,1c3r52x,0,"I don’t understand what is happening. Two years ago, I had a bad depressive episode with suicidal thoughts and all the good stuff, from which I literally recovered all by myself. One day I touched the bottom, I was fired from my job and I decided to… don’t be like that anymore. I know it sounds weird or stupid, but it worked. I came back to normal, more or less, and I put my life back on tracks. 

  
Now I suspect that actually I did not fully recover, but only swiped everything under the rug. I look normal, I work, meet people, do activities, I can be funny and extrovert.   
Sometimes when I stop, I feel deep sadness or I start crying uncontrollably for no reason, out of the blue. My life is very emotionally flat, I don’t feel a lot and I don’t care about almost anything. I tell myself that it is just my character, I’m just very cool about most things. I feel like I’m a very cold person. I have big difficulties in picking up hobbies, to the point that I have none. I am not really interested in anything. I have less appetite, but in a normal way. I eat, I want some specific foods but I am immediately full and I grow tired of them. And I am scared of everything, speed, heights, plane, skiing… 

  
I actively avoid people, never engaging in contacts with others and for this reason, I have no friends. I just don’t feel the need of social contact and I don’t see the point, because most people do not really care. When I am forced in social activities that I can’t avoid, I complain and dread the moment a lot but then I am even able to be funny and extrovert. Looking at me, I just look basic but not problematic or depressed. But I am starting to feel that there is something wrong in all of this. Technically there is no problem and I got so much better than two years ago. I even got promoted at work and I have a good salary and a comfortable life. But this is not the person I want to be. I would like to be passionate, active, and sociable. I’m just not able to force myself into it.

justaguycalledmax1,I always push people away,4,1c3itbn,1,"I never let people in. I never get as close to people as they get to me. My friends open up and are vulnerable with me, but I stay so closed off to everyone. I only ever allow myself to be vulnerable by myself because I just never feel completely safe with anyone else.

  
I start pushing people away when they start getting invested in me, start really caring about me. That's when I start becoming more and more distant. Never text first, and eventually just stop texting. I have friends who I sometimes want to reach out to again but I see we haven't talked in over a year, and I figure they probably don't want to hear from me by now.

  
I don't let anyone get close enough to really know me. For some, I feel like I would just be dissapointing if they stuck around, so I push them away before they can find out. Some I feel I am not good enough to be a part of their life. I feel it's partly a fear of being hurt, a fear of growing close and trusting with anyone, partly low self worth and self esteem. I don't feel I'm worthy or deserving of the love or compliments I'm given.

  
My friend has been really heartfelt with me lately, telling me he is always there for me whenever I need him, that I can count on him. And I'm just here thinking I don't deserve that, and I can't promise the same to you because I'm so fucking flaky I just know I'm going to push him away too. He's all in, he loves me (platonically), and that scares me.",1713061421.0,

nefiandgirly12,I’m tired of waking up heavy everyday and tired of depression,1,1c3qwjj,0,"I’m diagnosed with MDD, General and social anxiety, along with PTSD. Since I was around 10, I woke up with constant heaviness and dread everyday with only a few days of peace. I have been sexually harassed and assaulted so many times. I feel like I don’t belong anywhere because of my mental health issues and it’s hard for me to trust people because of trauma around getting betrayed. When it comes to love, I have been cheated on, repeatedly lied to, taken for granted, sexually, emotionally and verbally abused. My trauma around love is so severe that I can’t feel at peace with my current partner despite him being the kindest soul i’ve ever met. I always seem to disappoint my family because of my mental health. I feel like a burden to my friends because i’m so depressed. 

I had to stop self-harm cause of my therapist’s strict instructions but i want nothing more than to cut my wrist again and feel that relief. I’m on suicide watch but I just wish there was a way to end my life without being a burden to my loved ones but that is impossible. I just want this pain to go away.

Pm-Me-Bobs-Vagen,I feel very bad? Depressed? Angry?,1,1c3qszt,0,"My mother is a very kind person. She cares about me, loves me. I know that i'm lucky but i think i'm going through some stuff that i can't quite describe.

I get quite angry while i'm talking to my mom. A month ago i had to get a laser treatment on my back for health issues that i've had. About 10 days in i started to get some pimples, asked my mom and she said it's okay, no need to use antibiotic cream (Despite the doctor's advice)

Fast forward to next appointment and i still have a back full of pimples. Out of nowhere my monkey brain decides to yell at my mom. ""I trusted you'd know something."" ""Its your fault."" ""My back is still full of zits because of you."" etc. She visibly got upset and i was still fuming. 

Another time, in my culture it's important to visit relatives time to time. She asked if i wanna go, said it'd make my uncle happy. I said no, she asked one more time if i'd like like to go and i absolutely went nuts. I said a no is a no, i've had enough etc.

Now i'm thinking i could absolutely kindly explain that i don't wanna do it, or promise my mom i'd visit him someday. I feel very depressed, feeling like i have anger issues, every little thing that shouldnt bother me, bothers me. What should i do?",1713091952.0,
bc1885,Not sure what to do,1,1c3qrqn,1,"I have always struggled with moderation and always seek out highs. This isn’t always bad for when channelled into something positive, but more often than not it is alcohol, drugs or gambling.

I do everything to excess including drink and drugs. I don’t drink on a daily basis but i regularly get blackout drunk and make an idiot of myself/put myself in risky situations.

Competitive_Hold_258,My life so far.... Stop by and read if you can. Thank you,1,1c3q9f7,0,"I am a 20 year old guy and I don't know where my life is going.

I have no friends, never had a girlfriend, no guidance or future planning and I am just too tired. No dreams or ambitions because I have lost interest in life. I have been going through depression, anxiety and loneliness for the past 6 years and it just keeps getting worse.

I grew up in not a very friendly environment. Parents used to fight every other day over something, even witnessed some domestic violence. Dad was always out with his friends drinking and smoking and never really cared about me much. About 4 years ago my parents seperated for about 8 months but not an official divorce, they got back but those 8 months scarred me for life. Me and my brother were living with our mom during that time so I had to act like a father to my younger sibling and take responsibilities and my academic performance deteriorated. 

I was a good above average student, not the brightest but the last 4 years of school really took a toll on me because of all the bullying I endured. When schools went online due to covid I completely isolated myself from everyone and lost every single bit of social skill I had. I somehow passed school, it's been 2 years and I still fucking despise it because of all the traumatic experience I had.

No interests, no planning I started giving entrance exams for colleges. I didn't even take a break after school my parents just forced me into college. I chose programming and now 2 years into college I realise that I fucking hate my major and now I am just dragging myself till I graduate.

College has taken a toll on me too, I spend half of my day in college and when I am home I have no energy left to do anything. I was into gym and lifting but I found it so hard to do it along with college and at the same time my parents only want me to study 24/7 so they discouraged me from going to the gym and eventually..... I had to quit the gym. As of today I have lost all progress I made in the gym and now I hate looking at myself in the mirror.

Gym was my favourite hobby and coping method. Other than that I used to play video games. Now that the gym was gone I could only rely on video games. However last year in December my pc started crashing alot and turns out my graphics card died. Can't afford a new graphics card now so now the video games are gone too....

What now? Now all I do is drinking and smoking and I feel disgusted with myself because that was the reason I hated my dad in the first place and now I have stooped so low in life and it's only the 4th month of the year.

I have tried making friends in college, gym or just going out but there is just something off which I can't explain. It's like I can't build relationships anymore I fail to make myself important in others' life. Everyone knows me but no one really cares about me. I get no calls, no messages, I am just rotting in my room all day. Home to college, college to home and days are just passing by and I am losing touch day by day.

I can't focus anymore, I have exams from tomorrow and I haven't studied anything because my mind is full of these thoughts and alcohol and anxiety. I have to keep myself busy at all times to resist these thoughts but is it even healthy to keep yourself occupied 24/7 just to avoid your thoughts and panic attacks especially after losing my hobbies like gym and video games. 

I have no one to talk to, I feel extremely lonely and despite of my numerous attempts I can't fit in with people of my age group. I am just living my miserable life watching others enjoy, go out, make progress, lose their virginity etc. I don't like to call my life miserable because there are people who probably have it even worse so it makes me feel like I am being a bitch ranting about my small problems so I am just bottling up keeping everything inside me. I drink alone and lose senses for some time to escape reality that's the only thing that makes me feel good at this point.

I don't know where my life is going and I feel so numb that I can't even express emotions anymore. I don't wanna live anymore but don't wanna die too. I don't know what I am supposed to do I am just battling anxiety, depression, loneliness and mood swings all the time. The affects of smoking/drinking have also started to show up, I can feel my physical health going down too. I guess one way or the other I will end up taking my life like this.

Thank you for your time❤️ I hope you have a great day.",1713089740.0,

Garask66,Smell helps shock me out of a depressive episode,1,1c3pumg,0,"20M here, was diagnosed with mdd a few years ago. Occasionally, I experience extremely debilitating depressive episodes. They can happen really suddenly, probably within a few minutes I go from feeling fine to ""oh shit this again."" Once I'm there getting out is nearly impossible. I mostly just sit around and wait for it to go away, which it eventually does.

So here's what happened. A couple days ago I was in one of these episodes (it's been especially bad, on-and-off the past week) and I happened to be making cinnamon rolls. It's not something I do too often.

And once I started to smell the dough baking, it was so crazy, I felt this immediate sense of relief. It was wonderful, it was honestly like a painkiller. I didn't feel all the way better but it did provide some relief, at least for a little bit.

Like I said I've been going through it the past week, and upon this discovery I've been trying to smell different things and seeing how that affects the depression. What I've noticed is- generally, colognes/perfumes/soaps don't really work. And also, it has to be something really unique. Things I've smelled before don't have any affect on me. 

For instance I was at a store and smelled a guava-scented candle (I live in HI so everything is guava scented here) and immediately it was so pungent I felt that same wave of relief again.

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone knows why this is and/or has also experienced this in some way? And also if I should continue exploring this? Maybe invest in some candles or incense or something? That's never been a thing I've been interested in but I'm considering it. I'd love you hear your thoughts",1713088032.0,
