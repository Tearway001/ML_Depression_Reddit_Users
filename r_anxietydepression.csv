For context I have diagnosed GAD, MDD and Panic Disorder 
I have a history of minor self harm, and in the past few months it's been a bit worse so I tried the hairband on my wrist technique, except now I use it so much that my wrist is red and extremely raw so I'm worried that my brain is using the hairband as a new form of self-harm?!

Ralenj6,Some Words of Hope,2,1c5n6h1,0,"Some Words of Hope 

Speaking as someone who was here searching for answers, dying around this same time last year, and now in one of the best positions in my life, 
HAVE FAITH. 

• Change your mindset. Learn how to breathe (meditate for practice) Oxygen flow to the brain is crucial. 

• Release tension in your body (body scans/acupuncture). We carry tension in moments of stress that we might not be aware of. Releasing any muscles in your face is a good example. They’re usually activated. 

• Positive thoughts | Small wins
You are what you think you are. You’re moved by what you think. Don’t trust your thoughts while depressed or anxious. Force yourself to recognize the good even when everything is rubbish. 

Do what you can, give yourself grace, don’t worry about what you can’t do. Try but don’t kill yourself. You are not capable of functioning correctly when depressed. You’re not an idiot, you’re not that awkward, you’re not incapable of socializing, you’re not unpleasant to be around, you’re none of that stuff your mind tries to tell you, you just need a break from the pressures and stressors of the world.  Be kind to yourself. 

• Walk. Get outside. Physical activity is important. Fresh air is important. Food, hygiene, sleep, are important. Get your nutrition value in. Develop good sleep habits. I know a program for those interested. Please DM me if so. 


• Sleep is hella important to function correctly. Need to get it regularly and get help if you are not asap. 

• Do not consume alcohol. It’s a coping mechanism that does more harm than good. Get to the root of the healing you need. 

• Get a psychiatrist, make sure it works for you. I’ve had many of doctors and therapists and psychiatrists over the past decade. I’m black. For the first time I’ve found a black therapist and psychiatrist that I could relate to and understood me/the impact of how my cultural community responds to certain drugs and what to be mindful of, it’s been a world of difference. Having someone who understands me and who I can trust instead of just being a guinea pig. It’s helped me find better understanding and acceptance. 

• Acceptance is key.
- I’m lonely 
- I’m tired 
- I’m out of shape or overweight 
- I’m not where I want to be in life 
- I’m broke, in debt
- I’m scared 

All your feelings are valid, and it’s all okay.
You won’t be like that forever. As long as you can accept that, that’s all that matters. Everyone else has their own shit to figure out. Focus on you. 

• Stay positive and loving. That’s cool.
Negative energy only harbors more negativity. 
Don’t let this shit change who you are. 

Hope this helps some of you out there.
I can’t respond always, but if you message me I’ll do my best to. 

Hang in there my ppls, you got this!

Briefin69,Hear me... ,3,1c5j70v,2,"So here I go again: I can't stand the thought of working. Infact I hate it or it bores me to such an extent that I just wanna die. I'll be 25 in October this year.

It worsened so much so that most days I can't even sleep, or I'll wake up at the middle of the night thinking what's wrong with me, when I'll grow up etc... Most days I keep myself distracted, so that I feel less shameful and scared, which I know makes my problems worse. But I'm tired. And I know nobody cares. I mean my mom does, but she obviously can't help (so nowadays everyone advices me to do something, which I get why.) First of all its not easy to get a job, but even then I know I don't try at all. Cause I honestly see no point in working the whole day and then come home sleep and go next day repeat for the foreseeable future. And then? Die... I feel like then why not die today? Also as a hyper sensitive person, a regular day is already exhausting enough, that too working? Every fucking thing seems to overwhelm me. There's also currently no-one in my life that understands me or to whom I can relate (except for the being human part). I just wanna run away to somewhere where I'll be able to do whatever I want, whenever I want with joy, and no shame. I know a reddit post will most likely not solve anything or save me, but...

whatwouldcarado,Messed Up Sertraline Doses,2,1c5hqv9,3,"Ten days ago (April 6, 7, and 8) I took 1/3 of my SSRI medication (sertraline) on each of those days (I went away for the weekend and only brought  one dose by accident, so I split it in thirds).

rachnickk,When it gets to be too much,1,1c5fv3v,1,"A brief history: I have had symptoms of anxiety since before I can personally remember. I was diagnosed at 16 with generalized anxiety. At 17 I was diagnosed with depression. I am now 28. 

What do you do and when do you come to terms with the fact that it’s just not getting better? I have done it all. Therapy, counselling, self help books, anxiety work books..  I am on medications that help greatly. But… that’s it. The meds take away my intrusive thoughts but NOTHING helps my anxiety. Every day for the past four months before work I wake up at 4:30am extremely itchy and nauseous. I have eczema from my anxiety and it is getting progressively worse with time. I sweat and cry all morning before having to go to work because the thought of being around people is just too much. 

I don’t want to go on disability assistance but I am trying to come to terms with the fact that I just cannot work. I am physically ill every day in the morning that I have to work.  I panic for hours with tears streaming down my face and I’m just shaking and getting sick over working every morning. At work I excuse myself several times a day to cry in the bathroom or calm myself down.  I wish I was normal and it was easy for me. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I have a great partner who supports me but the cost of living is astronomical. I barely make enough on my 40 hours a week and my hours are dwindling down as I am becoming more and more sick each week. Last week driving to work my heart was racing so fast I drove the entirely wrong way (I’ve worked at this job for almost a year) and it made me late because I kept panicking and forgetting to make the correct turns. 

Some weeks are better than others but it’s all the same. I just don’t know what to do anymore. Is there anyone who has been in a similar spot? I just don’t know where to go from here. ",1713273414.0,

Tricky-Lobster9337,Sharing my childhood trauma for help,3,1c4ha9o,2,"
(24M) Hi everyone, I want to share my childhood trauma with you, with hopes of gaining some insights on how to cure it or at least finding someone who can relate.

I was 10 when my parents sent me and my 6 y/o brother to a summer soccer camp for 10 days. I remember going there with a very happy face, and I really enjoyed the first day and night there, but on the second day my brother came to me, crying out loud and visibly sad and disturbed, saying that he missed our parents and that he wanted to go home. I don't know what happened in that moment, but something broke inside me and I experienced a massive panic attack, which I tried to repress trying to make my brother feel safe, but I couldn't handle it and sunk myself into a state of constant and acute anxiety, needing to cry every second and, being a 10 y/o, not understanding such a painful feeling. Those next 9 days were the longest of my life, counting every second to go back home. The hardest part was keeping a smile on my face and trying to confort my little brother while being destroyed on the inside, definitely not a role which a 10 y/o should assume.

I haven't been the same ever since, my theory is that such a massive panic attack and a sustained acute anxiety for 9 days as a kid changed my brain chem forever and I have never been able to fully enjoy life ever since. I ended up normalizing having trauma, General Anxiety Disorder as well as Disthymic Disorder. 

Although I usually end up enduring them through a lot of pain and anxiety, I have never been able to peacefully confront situations with similar patterns ever since: going on trips with school, traveling alone, facing the first day of a new job... In the spirit of facing this trauma, two summers ago I went abroad for a month to volunteer in a farm but the first day I arrived there, I experienced (again) such a massive panic attack and anxiety that I drove the 12 hours back to my house immediately. Feels very frustrating at the very least and impedes me to find a job. I also need to say that of course I don't blame my brother nor my parents for this, I am sure that if they would have felt what I was feeling they would have pulled us out of there immediately.

I am currently starting on meds, I'm also starting on therapy and I will try to self-administer EMDR. Can anyone give some tips or insight on this trauma? Thanks for reading :)

Ambitious-Cake-,Can I take clonazepam a couple of hours before my exams? ,1,1c4jwrp,1,"I generally take clonazepam a couple of hours before exams. 1-2 mg. I've been doing it since an year. It did work for a couple of exams fantastically last year. But this time, I feel a bit disoriented in the exam hall. I'm not sleepy or drowsy but I just don't know what I'm doing and how to structure my answers. I end up submitting incomplete papers and mixing up concepts I know really well. I'm not sure whether this has anything to do with on the spot anxiety or the pill. I won't deny that for the exams that went well, I'd pre drafted the answers and put in more structured efforts. In today's exam, I'd studied the concepts extremely well and had my notes before hand. But I just didn't know what to write because I got so confused and felt stuck. Also, I've been attempting exams only after 2 years. I have been skipping all my exams since the past two years because of profound anxiety. It's just that, even if I've taken clonazepam the precious night or day, my heart doesn't stop pounding on the day of the exam. I genuinely don't know what to do.

I just sit on my desk minding my own business.
It’s especially worse during the last 2 hours of my shift because there are only 3 of us left by that time. My 2 colleagues talk to each other and have casual conversations, I.e about dinner, their families, love life etc.

I feel like the odd one out, I feel invisible because they don’t really talk to me, unless I need help with my work. Although all of my colleagues are nice and kind to me, I just think they might feel like I’m not interested in talking since I’m very quiet and reserved.

But I feel like I’m being ignored even though I’m sure that’s not their intention.

Most of my colleagues are a lot older in age than me, there is only one woman who is around my age. But I just can’t seem to befriend anyone. I’ve always had this problem since I was in school, but I thought it might be different by now. But I guess not.

I don’t know what to do. I was just offered a full time position and I will be starting my first full time shift tomorrow. But that just means I will be feeling miserable for a lot longer than I did before.

musicalmuse1995,Can I share?,1,1c3guoy,1,"Hi Guys,

I have been on and off the internet looking for ""answers"" to my apparent life problem. I have been suffering since I was a young kid and I have not known a time when I was fully alive, at peace and in the moment. I have always been experiencing this sense of unease and that something is very wrong. I have constant worry thoughts, intrusive thoughts and fears about the most absurd things, but also about the most intensely philosophical things. At least when I was a kid, I could focus exclusively on Oatmeal Creme Pies, Spongebob and Biking with friends. Now all my mind does is worry about death being around the corner every second, falling ill, having a massive tragedy and people judging me. I have this inner critic that makes me want to jump out of my own body. Man, I cannot describe how incessant and mean my thoughts are. I get confused sometimes, because I get so caught up in the thoughts thinking that its me producing every thought. But even that makes no sense. I couldn't possibly produce these thoughts consciously...

I want to discuss something that has been bothering me almost as much as the thoughts. I have been dealing with an insanely f'd up experience of feeling like I am completely numb physically and that I am just experiencing reality through a tiny, dimensionless point in my mind. But like I don't feel like I am really here at all. I feel as though I am a meaningless, dimensionless and feeling-less dot basically suspended in the mental realm and I am experiencing a super diluted version of what real life truly is like for a human. It's not quite depersonalization or derealization... or maybe it is? But the strangest thing is that it never goes away. It literally is my default state of being, and that makes me think that it is completely unfixable. Does this make any sense to anyone? Has anyone ever heard of something like this? It is like the worst ever drug trip, but there's no hallucinations. It's like life is the hallucination. I cannot even express it well in words because it is so utterly disturbing and strange. I have gotten so used to this experience that it just seems like my normal but it indeed makes me feel horrible. Especially when I am undistracted, I feel immensely horrible. It is like a nightmare and being human is like the strangest thing ever to me. I cannot even believe I am a human. It is so weird and I do not feel right at all. 

Is this anxiety or something else? Possibly, it seems like it's a combination of chronic anxiety, trauma and maybe something else. I don't know y'all. I do not want to be living this way for years and years. I just want to feel normal and fully alive. I want to feel the normal spectrum of emotions and feel at ease during the day. I want to feel joy, real love and inner peace. I have started being more kind and compassionate to myself, but it is hard when I get in really depressed, angry and resentful moods like I did today. Any support would be amazing. Thanks",1713055234.0,

RaincornUni,"I don't have regrets, I have anxiety",2,1c2uuhk,0,"Ranting;
These are my circumstances:
No antidepressants, no money, anxiety issues flaring as I make realizations and need somewhere to talk about it while I have too much anxiety (and other neurodivergent issues) to call a therapist.

Here are my thoughts:
I don't have regrets, I have anxiety. My mind constantly thinks and races over every worse case scenario and I can't exist without medications. Anxiety makes it where you regret everything, pick apart piece by piece why or how you could've done something different and if you had done something different, you wouldn't be experiencing the anxiety you are right now. -it doesn't take into consideration anything else in the situation, just that if you'd done something different you wouldn't have anxiety or be stressed out about it!- 

Oh and the things that I could've done differently? I did those things to help with my anxiety and daily functioning to overall allow me to be happier :D so clearly there's always a downside to decisions made to help yourself! And I made those decisions when I was financially stable and had money and did even afterwards for a little bit. As soon as I run out of antidepressants and it's been a few days? Fun thoughts fun times and ultimate utilization of previously learned coping skills because honestly it's the only time that I can effectively will myself to use them because otherwise, what I am experiencing is so intense either on a depressive or anxiety side, that it is not something I can *will* myself to do. There are times I can will myself to do the things I was taught for my depression and anxiety and other times it doesn't matter what I want or much try to do, my mind will focus all of it's energy into it until I am exhausted and then maybe, maybe I won't be as emotionally sensitive. Sometimes I'm not, sometimes I am. 

Should I even talk about how my partner is autistic, experiences depression anxiety and other things, and sometimes it feels like she doesn't understand that it isn't something I can do, trying to use coping skills, because it's so exhaustive and I'm so hyper focused on my feelings 😭 but I know they obviously understand the inability to do something no matter how much they want to, it just hurts and it's all hard and I just need someone who understands how overwhelming it is not being on BC and antidepressants, and when you're about to start your period. -no more birth control because pulmonary emboli :D -

-No money = no blood thinner = no birth control = pulmonary emboli = constant/current stress and worry about related symptoms that could be anxiety, acid reflux, or because of the clot and struggle to physically get oxygen into my body = more anxiety 
No money ----> more anxiety; no money = no doctors = no BC alternatives = PCOS cysts, heavy bleeding, worse mood swings = more anxiety, more issues, untreated problems 

And to take into account the fact I've been on BC much of my menstruating life, started taking it after a few years because of heavy painful cramps and later got diagnosed PCOS. I don't know what my body and hormones are like off of birth control or if it would be that much different. It's been a month and a half since I've stopped taking it and I don't know when my hormones would stabilize, except now they really won't now that I have been out of antidepressants for probably five days now (Time blindness; been thinking it's one day later all week)

Anyway thanks for listening. Not looking for anything, at most if someone can relate to or understand any my experiences so I don't feel so alone and crazy with the overthinking and everything else. It's why I still want to go to therapy and understand the how and why of me - because my current diagnoses (and lack thereof) don't make me feel that all my issues are properly being seen and heard, but I'm almost entirely convinced it is severe generalized anxiety. At the very least, it would feel better to know that if this is other people's experiences with anxiety because if it isn't, then it would give me further reason to feel like there is something else that isn't being explained, other than simply feeling that way because that's anxiety, isn't it?

TL;DR 
Not having money makes my anxiety worse which makes everything else a bigger problem than it is, ranting. ",1712987801.0,
Weary-Ad9458,(Reposting for time-sensitive advice) Burnout Rant,1,1c2qwtu,0,"I am completely depleted, I have no more time to recover and I just want to lay down and abandon myself entirely. I'm at the end of my masters degree (art related) and I realize I'm not going to make it. I've stopped replying to emails weeks ago, stopped taking care of myself. I've spent every waking hour for the past term, past year even, trying to work on projects and commissions, but I haven't been able to make a single one. Multiple projects which are needed for me to graduate are now a day from being presented, and weeks overdue, but the time between looking at my laptop and having a breakdown isn't even a factor anymore, because it's so insurmountable, I can barely react.  

Despite asking for mental health support months in advance to avoid this scenario, only to be met with blank stares or dismissal, despite sacrificing the potential supports and friendships I could've had so I could focus and try to turn things around (repeating the phrase: I just need to get through it, religiously)
It's past the point of saving, and I fear I'm not going to recover from this kind of let down.

I hate that I have nothing to show for it, that I was wrong about the person I thought I was, and I've become a person I can't recognize. The worst part is I'm not the only person I've let down because of it. I wish people could know how sorry I am for letting it get this bad, I wish people could know how hard I tried. 

If there are any suggestions on what I can do I in the worst case scenario I would appreciate it.

So I have cardiophobia and recently decided to take charge of my mental health and try to get back to a good place and hopefully get back in the gym.

So I started all this with having Myriad Gene Testing to see what medications would or wouldn’t work for me. I’ve taken Lexapro for maybe 5 years, while waiting for the results my psychiatrist and I decided to try Zoloft. I was having horrible reactions to the Zoloft and after about 9 days taking it I was ordered to stop. That was about a week ago now. I got my gene testing back. 

Both Lexapro and Zoloft were indicated as having severe gene drug interaction. For all I knew, they were just making things worse. All those years taking Lexapro and it was possibly, slowly, just making it worse. So after much discussion with my doctor I have decided that for the next 4 weeks until my next appointment I am going to not take any medications besides my emergency anxiety medications and that’s just vistiril (Benadryl without the antihistamines) 

I’ve never really gone through withdrawal before of the medication but so far it’s rough. Headaches, brain zaps, nausea, some dizziness. Today’s better than yesterday at least. Today I also managed to ride an exercise bike for 30 minutes, get my heart pumping, and NOT have a panic attack or get anxiety. It’s a start it’s a slow start but still I have to be proud of me. Any other time I would be crying or in full “oh god I’m having a heart attack” mode but I’m not. 

Could the lexapro really have made things that much worse over the years? I don’t know. But the fact I was able to work out today and that I’m dealing with these symptoms and not having anxiety about them tells me that I’m a lot stronger than I thought I was

Sorry-Statistician71,"Need help getting through to my dad...severe depression, anxiety, guilt, and unwilling to try to get better.",2,1c15c5d,2,"Hi All - any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated to help me get through to my dad. 

Long story short, my dad has had severe depression and anxiety for a couple years and ended up making an attempt to take his own life back in 2020. He (nor my mom) really talked about his depression before and we didn't really even know about it so the suicide attempt was a complete shock. He started seeing someone and doing therapy and trying different medications but always complained about the side effects and would come up with excuses for how he was feeling. According to my mom, he never liked going to the doctor or getting this kind or help and thought he was a lesser person for taking medications. I think this has led to major trust issues with his therapist and psychiatrist. About a year ago, he made the decision that he wanted to stop taking any medication at all.

The past couple months have been pretty terrible and he cant even cope with the smallest things that happen. For instance, recently he was carrying groceries in and a jar of sauce fell out of the bag and shattered, and he had a complete meltdown over it and his day was completely derailed. The smallest things cause him to lose any ability to function.

This all has been extremely tough on my mom, and she has talked to me about the possibility of leaving my dad. Dad tells mom every day he loves her but makes no effort to get better. Today, I find out from my mom that dad's psychiatrist (or therapist, cant recall which one) had been giving my dad exercises to do between sessions and my dad makes zero effort to attempt them and the guy he is seeing can tell my dad isnt even trying to get better. This guy gave my dad an ultimatum and dad needs to make an effort and prove that he is making an effort, or provider is done working with my dad as he's got other patients that want help and are willing to work at it. My mom also basically tacked on an ultimatum that he has to try and get better or she is gone as well.

It's really hard to help someone that doesnt want to help themselves, and this has been going on for years. Hopefully the ultimatums are the kick in the ass he needs to get on the right track and try, but it could also just send him down a road he wont ever come back from.

I feel like at bare minimum he needs to get back on a low dose medication to help even a little bit. Would love to see him do more of an intensive out-patient program but he would certainly fight that tooth and nail. He literally cant cope with making his own decisions, and carries around so much guilt from his suicide attempt. 

My brother is home this weekend, and I think we need to all get together and talk to him. Really not sure what to do or say to help. We've all been trying to support him but he just wont do anything to get better. He really needs some sort of intervention but I dont know what will get through to him and I dont want to just keep piling everything on when he cant cope with the smallest of hiccups. Both my parents are retired and I feel terrible for my mom as well, she has mentioned she feels trapped in her own house and is worried sick about my dad all the time.

Everyone would want to copy my homework and during group work, no one in my group would be productive because they knew I would do all the work anyway. My entire life I equated how I did in school with how smart I was.

Then I graduated university.

Suddenly, there were no more grades. There were no more classes I had to make, or books I had to read. No more helping others with their schoolwork, reading over essays hundreds of times to catch any and every mistake, or leading group discussions about academic topics. I had no way to measure my intelligence anymore.

It's been 2 years since I graduated and I can't stop feeling dumb. I constantly feel like my friends and family members are talking down to me. I always regret voicing my opinions because I feel stupid afterwards. If my perspective doesn't align with someone else's, I assume they're right and I'm wrong—or just an idiot. I don't take risks in fear that I will fail. I downplay my education and experience and never ask to be compensated for what I'm worth.

He is not a narcissist himself, but when stress, anxiety and insecurities pile up, he can have some ugly qualities. 

Before my husbands drinking became an issue, we were able to have difficult conversations and he was able to shoulder stress like any average adult.  One day, a shift happened. He started having anxiety attacks, was fearful of driving, intense cases of the hiccups and consistent vomiting due to anxiety. All this new fear led to coping by binge drinking.

The drinking happened frequently and privately. I did not keep alcohol in the house, I would never find an empty bottle, but several breathalyzers, a DUI and some blackouts later, the evidence of a bottle wasn’t needed.

In the light of a new day, he would confess to drinking a half to a full pint of vodka all at once. He did this on an off for 6 years. At its worst it happened several times a week, then transitioned into once every three months at least.

I am happy to say he has been sober over a year. He attended rehab and several outpatient programs, but he still has all that unresolved anxiety and trauma.  What I really want to know is why when sober he used to be ok under pressure? Nothing great, but he kept it together and could get through the motions. Now, why does he sometimes try to unzip the baby out of her onesie from the foot up without considering he cannot get it over her head. He is generally considerate in the bathroom but he stumbles as if drinking and has no coordination when using the bathroom in this state. His right eye also gets heavy and lazy.

When asked to wipe it up, because he isn’t aware of the mess he is making, instead of grabbing a napkin he got down on all fours, looked at the carpet and claimed he didn’t see anything. It’s like all common sense and capabilities leaves his body.

He gets a glossy, bug eyed look to his eyes, he has trouble articulating a thought, answering questions directly and sometimes will forget things he just said or did or claims he said or did things he did not do.

During all that he’s not drunk. I’ve done breathalyzers and sometimes you can bring him back down to earth enough to have a slightly productive conversation, but most days he just passes out as if drunk, is unresponsive and impossible to wake up if you need him as if blacked out. It’s absolutely emotional shut down, but what medically is happening to him? How does he lose all cognition under stress?

Looking for any helpful responses to navigate this sad and frustrating situation.

patrickfw15,Constant feeling of doom and dread ,5,1bxh3bc,3,"For context, I have been dealing with bi-polar depression from a young age. My father died when I was six, my brother died in his sleep when I was 12, my family home burned down when I was 16, and then I failed to resuscitate my grandmother at the age of 19. 

Throughout this period of tragedy I never felt “depressed”. I felt a call to action to ensure the safety and financial stability of my family. I was told that even as a child I, “walked around like the world was on my shoulders”. Our once vibrant and full home turned into a dark and empty place. Money was very tight and we were always worried about the next death. 

It wasn’t until 2019 when I took a promotion at work that brought my family a comfortable middle class lifestyle. However, it was the pressure of this lifestyle that crushed me. All I thought about was failing. Losing what I fought to attain. I felt grief from this anxiety the same way I dealt with mourning my brother’s death.  I became disassociated and felt a wave of depression that shook me to my core. Constant thoughts of suicide and a desire to have never been born. 

I sought psychiatric help but it wasn’t very helpful. SSRI’s exacerbated the issue and made me check out of reality more than deal with it. I learned that my mental state ebbs and flows. Four months in fine. Next two months I am in danger. It wasn’t until last May that I completely broke. My wife was pregnant but her doctor did not think the fetus was viable- recommend an abortion. A week went by before my wife got a second opinion which informed us that the pregnancy was viable.

While I was ecstatic, I felt broken. I could not function. I planned my suicide for late July. The night of, I went to my drawer where I kept my medication and all of the pills were missing. I just went back to sleep. The next morning I told my wife and she got me help. 

I was out on FMLA for three months. Got better and returned to work. This week I am ending my three month paternity leave and I feel the doom creeping in.

Not sure what to do anymore.

AnniesNote,Afraid to tell my therapist I relapsed,6,1bwmlkh,7,"
Hi all. I’ve been struggling in general for the past few months with both my anxiety and depression. Because of side effects I was put on a different antidepressant, but it’s done literally nothing for me other than cause more side effects so I stopped taking it. One of the side effects I was having was violent thoughts and irritability, which is taking its sweet time going away. 

So I had a therapy session last week. My anger/irritability has only gotten slightly better since I stopped. Because of a stupid rule change I can now only get in to see my T once a month rather than every other week, which has only made me more upset over the situation; I also think it’s pointless and ineffective to only meet once a month. I had a “meh” session where I felt like I wasn’t really all there and that we didn’t accomplish much; I was just really having a bad, off day. I’m afraid to talk to my T about the scheduling issues—both because I don’t really think there’s much she can do about it and I also because I think I suck and don’t deserve it—how am I any different than her other clients that I assume also have trouble getting in? 

 I called to schedule another appointment after session. Still can only get in three weeks later. After hanging up I was even more upset. Upset at the situation, upset for my inability to talk to my therapist about how much I hate not being able to get in, upset at life. I cried. Ugly cried. I ended up biting my arms/hands several times until I bled. 

I know I should talk to my T about this next time I see her, but I’m ashamed of relapsing after being clean 7 years and I feel like a disappointment, plus I don’t want to tell her not being able to get in to see her was part of the reason I got so upset.  The worst thing about all this is that every night when I can’t sleep I sit and stew over not being able to get in and all I want to do is hurt myself. I’ve written things down and given it to her before and I have written down the events and feelings about that day, but I’m still so ashamed and afraid to give it to her next time. I don’t know what to do. ",1712335055.0,

I'm having a bad brain day today. Things feel overwhelming and hard. My breathing feels like I have a hole in my esophagus and I haven't had this feeling in such a long time. I feel like I've been looking over my shoulder for months now. It feels like I can't catch a break. It feels like one step forward and two steps back. I want to breath again. I want to feel semi normal again. I just want to be okay.  


The thing is, I know I'll be okay. I know that I'll look back on all of this and see how I made it through and I'll feel normal again. I know I need to slow down and not try and rush things because I'll watch life just roll by. I know all of this. I know everything is going to be alright, just going slow and steady. And I do know I'll be okay.   
It's just so hard. My brain and body won't just relax. It's the constant fight or flight response just going off in my body when there is nothing to fight or run from.  I just want to feel semi normal again. I want that feeling back in my body that hasn't been present in a long time.  


I scheduled an appointment with my therapist for sometime this month. It's been a while since I talked to them. I know this is a step in the right direction of feeling better.

I’m 25F.

All sorts of weird throat and neck issues started after, including a bit of discomfort when talking like effort like feeling, heavy and occasionally painful neck and a CONSTANT sensation of a choking, swollen and strangling feeling inside my neck that’s even where today and been here pretty much all these weeks if not got worse. Don’t know if it’s related. I also have some ongoing mild ish pain in both lower and upper throat (the part of throat you can see) when swallowing pretty much since then for threee weeks now. And upper sore and reddish throat, that one almost feels like when you get sick. Jose been runny a bit too so not sure if it’s allergies/post-nasal drip, a bacteria, an STD, or neck/thyroid/larynx damage and/or hematoma in neck.

I’m freaking out extra since I have thyroid issues and just now under investigation for whether I have autoimmune thyroid stuff like Graves disease or Hashimoto’s or any thyroid dysfunction. Won’t have results for a while yet. 

The swollen, physically hard constant strangling and choking feeling at the front of my neck/in my throat has been near constant and so scary and debilitating. Its almost like a gagging feeling at the back of my throat/lower and I need to keep swallowing to try and get rid o fit. I’m afraid maybe my partner putting his hands there a little stronger than usual caused my thyroid to swell up and slowly choke me, or ruptured my two cystic nodules and the contents spilled out, maybe they were cancer inside them so the cancer now spread through my body, or my larynx and thyroid have been broken and displaced all this time and since I already had a goiter and some kind of thyroid issue that maybe it’s now swollen so bad and will slowly be progressive and cause slow choking/serious trouble.

I’m too scared to do a CT scan of my neck with contrast which it usually is with, until some blood test results come back about my thyroid but that can still take days and I already want to go into ER and have them check my neck but they might want to do a CT with contrast there but I don’t have my thyroid blood results yet and I don’t want to get thyroid storm by getting contrast dye. I’ve been feeling so sick and unwell I bounce form having cancer, having thyroid worse damage and neck damage from the choking, to having all of it including a bad infection cause I developed a deep dry cough too, always dizzy, sometimes nearly feel like I might pass out and ALWAYS tired.

I should never have let him do this but I wa stupid and knew nothing about the risks at the time. Now I’m here in this mess and don’t know how to make it out with everything being safe and okay. I really feel very unwell physically.

I also have other lumps and masses across my body for years that I never got checked out cause I didn’t take them seriously etc.

brucelong10000,Ways to Manage Anxiety and Depression ,4,1busnxt,0,"Hi All

I suffer from anxiety and depression but got it under control in my adult years (20 upwards) with alcohol,pointless sex with hookers,drugs and masturbation.I became an extremely outgoing,arrogant person with alot of friends.I know alot of people can relate to that.For 10 years I had things under control and it took a few lost business deals,breakup,losing a sibling and I completely unraveled where the very same things that use to calm me resulted in chaos and even more anxiety.

As I’m typing this I feel abit better and taking it one day at a time.Iv been going through the worse mental health with depression and anxiety for over a year but have only recently managed to get better.

Things I would suggest.

1.Stop drinking
2.No porn & Masturbation 
3.Force yourself to be outside each and every day even if it’s completely unbearable.
4.Have a checklist for the lil things(small victories straighten the mind), make your bed,brush your teeth,take a shower, clean and do the dishes.
5.Physical activity before leaving home(do a few pushups,situps or weights just to get your dopamine levels up).
6.Try and find a way to do the things you enjoy inside,but doing them outside (reading,gaming etc).I usually take a book with me when I leave the house,find a place and read 
7.Go for a walk atleast once a day,leave your phone in doors,walk around the block and just clear your head.
8.Pray ,if you don’t believe in God,just find a time before you sleep where you can kneel,close your eyes,reflect on your day,where you are and where you want to be mentally and also in other aspects of your life
9.Take a break from social media or remove any negative pages,subs or people from your timeline.


These things are not medication for our illness but they sure do help abit.I’m definitely no where close to being complete ok but atleast I don’t want to kill myself now.

Ps I’m not a phycologist or a mental health guru,but someone also battling and it pains me to read your messages and I hope I could do more to help cause I know how it feels.

for context (without getting too specific bc i know that isn't appropriate for this sub) i'm supposed to take one SSRI and one antipsychotic nightly. this is day 2 unmedicated, and last night was the worst sleep i've had in years - i kept waking up from insane, frightening, exhausting dreams and only got 3 hours sleep. this isn't the first time i've been forced to go cold turkey in between prescriptions, but i'm worried it'll be the longest i'm without meds and since i switched prescriptions a bit ago, i'm not too sure how I'll react this time around.  
i have to be on campus all week, and a friend's dinner this evening. currently i'm struggling with nausea mostly, which is less than ideal as a severe emetophobe. the nausea (and the potential that i might puke on campus) is just making me much more anxious.

  
the only advice i can find online about sudden SSRI/antipsychotic withdrawal is not to do it 💀 there's very little advice on how to actually cope with when it does happen  
ik i need to get better at picking up my meds regularly - even though adhd makes it really hard, picking up my meds at the same time every month is something i really need to prioritise. i have a lot of shame surrounding telling people when this happens, so none of my family or friends know right now.

  
i'd be super grateful for any practical advice to help tie me over until then - in terms of coping with nausea, sleeplessness, anxiety or any other potential side effects

He definitely tries to comfort me and show me love in different ways…like making sure I’m eating and drinking water, taking my meds, getting sleep, checking up on me. 
I’ve just been holing up in my room and avoiding things. Not in a way that I’m being irresponsible or avoiding my problems. I don’t want my roommates to see me like that. I also work for a big corporation and my family has really made that apart of my identity, which in turn I also have.

I’ve had some bad reactions this time around to some medication and it has been hell since December but it is slowly getting better. Something’s that helped me was for one getting a second opinion on my medication from a mental health urgent care clinic. The psychiatrist on staff was super helpful and helped adjust my medication which helped so much. Like everyone I just went along with what my psychiatrist was doing because they are the professional. Other thing that has helped was get a new therapist, I was finding that my previous therapist wasn’t helping and I stayed with them because I was looking for any hope at the time. My new therapist listens and also is making a plan for me so that I can get back to my normal, even working through trauma and giving me techniques to help with panic attacks and anxiety, they explain things for me in a way that I can understand and makes sure that I am understanding. I am currently reading a book “Cptsd from surviving to thriving” and “Overcoming Intrusive Thoughts” which has helped and explained certain things about trauma and the brain and how it is stored. I think for anyone struggling reading or listening to that book will help. I learned how the brain works with anxiety and panic attacks which has helped me understand that anxiety will try to look for any threat to make sense of the situation the body and mind is going through even though there isn’t necessarily a threat. And if you think you’re going crazy remember that people who have mental health disorders do not know they have them and wouldn’t be looking for them. That’s our brain trying to make sense of the invisible threat. It will literally grasp for anything, I was so afraid of hurting myself because the thought crossed my mind and scared me causing my OCD to kick in. My anxiety/OCD took that thought and made it into the threat even though it was an intrusive thought. We all have them and it’s normal to have those thoughts because they are just thoughts that pop up then leave seconds after. I also put on meditation videos or sound baths on before I sleep to help calm me for a nights rest. I know when we are in desperate need we tend to do listen and do anything to help even though it’s not helping. And it’s okay that what we first hoped for didn’t work the first time like we hoped. There is help for you out there, don’t give up or settle. Things will get better and the feelings you are having will pass even when we think it won’t. ",1711946482.0,
Lounay,I feel Unloved,3,1bshtia,2,"I feel unloved and unappreciated

Hi everyone, I post here from time to time but my headspace is gotten so much worse. I get so annoyed with myself but I can't stop the way I'm feeling.

To set the scene. I am a 24f and have been with my fiancè for five years. We live in a three bedroom house with a small lawn (important for later). He makes the most money and as I am still studying I make next to nothing at my retail job. My parents came to visit for easter and I was happy to see them but I work weekends too.

Now work has been hard as I pour so much effort into my job and I do things that are not required nor am I paid for to help improve it but my boss still always says it's not enough and if sales don't improve the shop will close and I'm to blame. It's made my depression a lot worse. I have been thinking of quiting as it's making me suicidal but my dad says I give up to easily and that I must stop being overemotional. He's always been like this one of the big reasons for my depression. Any way, so when I come home after a rough day at work I am excited to see our pets. We have two cats and one dog. However over the last year none of them are really loving or want to be near me when I need them most.

I talk to my fiancè but even though he listen he doesn't understand and his way to help me is to give me the ""basic"" solutions everyone always does. Go back to your psychologist, change your pills etc.

So work makes me feel useless, my dad makes me feel like a failure for wanting to quit. My fiancè makes me feel unloved and like he doesn't listen really or try to understand my mind. Then the little guys I care for uncoditionally ignores me.

I feel like such a waste of space. I think I need something/someone who can provide me with love and attention constantly ( I know it's not healthy). So I brought up the idea of getting a psychiatric service dog and my fiancè says it's just another excuse to get more pets and more responsibilities.

On March 22, 2024 I went to the place he works which is a bar. He works as a waiter. And I heard what sounded real to me a girl laughing at me and insulting me saying that they’ve been seeing each other since February. My boyfriend reassured me that it wasn’t true and that no one would ever do that to me. Why would a girl brag about that? And insult me in a public place where everyone can hear her. 
Since then I’ve been paranoid and hearing my BF murmur insults under his breath towards me whenever I was far enough away from him. I asked him about it but he reassured me it wasn’t true. But last night March 28, 2024. It got so bad that I blurted out that I want to break up with him to my BF. That I think it would be better because I feel like with my condition I can’t feel like I can’t trust him and I think it’d be better for him if he wasn’t with me because I’m so emotionally unstable and I let what I hallucinate get to me as in I really believe its real. 
2 hours later I regretted it after talking with him and having him reassure me everything I’ve heard him say that was negative wasn’t true. But the damage had already been done.  He said its better we separate on work on ourselves. 
I feel so broken hearted and regret my decision to say I wanted to break up. But I can’t take it back now. He said its better we separate and I don’t want to force him to stay with me if thats his decision. 
I’m not really sure why I’m posting this here now. I guess I just want some comforting words and advice. I feel so hurt because if I was normal without this psychosis I feel like we could’ve been happy together. I really hurt him though. Saying telling more than once that I though he was using me for money to get back with his ex and fix his family. 
I guess its better that were not together right? I’m not mentally stable. And he has his own personal problems that he wants to fix. ",1711673305.0,

I didn’t tell anyone the nature of my relationship during that time and there weren’t any signs so I wouldn’t have expected them to realise I was struggling, and instead just perceived me as absent from every invite.

Any guy friends were cut off when I met my fiancé because they all had expressed feelings toward me. 

The result is that I no-longer communicate with everyone I grew up with.

I just don't know how and my time is running short and I need someone NOW

My mom always pushes me aside and doesn't do anything and thinks I'm not listening to her and begging me to understand her when I clearly can't handle it and can't take it anymore.

Odd-Bed-2662,Life update on healing,6,1botw72,1,"Awhile back I posted about having some serve anxiety and dpdr with my meditation. Long story short my psychiatrist was bumping me up way too fast and I had activation. It was horrible the most suicidal I’ve ever been. I felt crazy and helpless, the dread and fear was constant and the intrusive thoughts were just horrible. Telling me I’m not going to get better and everyone is lying to me that I am. Or am I real? A lot of mind body disconnection. I still somewhat feel the disassociation but at least there’s not intense anxiety attached to it. I went to a mental health urgent care the staff and psychiatrist saved my life. The psychiatrist helped me through what I was going through and explained and answered questions about the medication and what it was doing to my brain and body. She suggested lowering the dose and adding in anti anxiety med. She also suggested in getting a new therapist because the one I had wasn’t working. It’s been 2 weeks since then and I’ve noticed a difference in anxiety not very anxious and my intrusive thoughts have calm down a lot. My new therapist is actually giving me tools to help me deal with my anxiety and depression as well. I still have dpdr but slowly it’s going away. But here’s the thing in the back of my head I don’t want the anxiety to go away because I’m worried about “what if I have an attack and I don’t know how to flow with it?” It’s the only thing keeping me from completely letting go of the worry at this moment. I just think it’s wild that our brain and do some much harm when it’s thinks it’s keeping us safe. 

Anyone who’s having a hard time with overly sensitive hearing or rapid fire thoughts. I’ve been doing guided meditation or sound baths while going to bed it does help for me. And reading books on ways to help cope with everything helps as well. Sometimes what you read doesn’t necessarily connect to you but it’s always good to read those parts anyways incase you end up needing the tools or reassurance later if something happens. I was reading that what helps with certain things is community as well. Interacting not just reading. So engaging with each other can help the psyche. And for anyone having hard time with anxiety and intrusive thoughts I just remind myself that we can reprogram our brain with CBT and that usually helps the process. And for anyone who thinks the are going crazy or going to go into psychosis or schizophrenia just remember that your anxiety is trying to latch on to anything to help  make sense of what is happening. It’s trying to find a threat. I do still have moments where I feel like I’m hearing or “seeing” things but it’s just my anxiety trying to find a threat of any kind. Stay strong and just know it’s okay to get help and not bottle everything help.

I have a tough time dealing with things in my life sometimes, and sometimes I feel hopeless and moody.

There's certain things in my life that I can't overcome I feel and I'd rather just sleep it off as it takes away the emotional aspect/pain of things. And plus, obviously, sleep is great.

But today they've told me that they have some returned mail and I told them im staying at the mission and they said they'll need to call me back so they can get clarification on whether or not they can schedule me...

Because apparently they need an address for safety reasons. 

And to be fair she did say that she just needs clarification... so being at the mission might not affect anything. 

But I'm anxious. I'm mad.  I'm sad.  I'm disheartened.

There are so many people who are homeless who would benefit from therapy and if they can't get it because they are homeless or living at the mission then what is this world coming to? 

And if they can't schedule me... I've already been seeing my therapist for just over a year and I'm still in the ""trying to open up"" stage. If I have to switch I feel like it'll be another year before I can get back to where I'm at now in terms of therapy. 

I can't mentally afford another year. This past year has already been rough enough when I had stable housing and my cats that I've had for ever... but now I'm homeless at the shelter and I had to give my cats to the humane society because I couldn't bring them with me.

Reason for the tag:      
>!I'm deathly afraid of dying, but most of the time I don't want to be alive.

I'm going to keep looking on the brightside because that's what I've always tried to do.

Vit B12 = 221.2 pg/ml in 2023  
Vit B12 = 284.6 pg/ml in 2024  and I'm in my twenties (age group)

Similarly my Vitamin D3 used to be 19.15 ng/ml  
I also have regular Stomach acidity issues throughout the year got tested for Anti TTG IgA and IgG which both came negative   
My Thyroid levels FT4 and TSH are within normal range and CBC also in normal.  
Things I am going through are spasms in different part of body muscle twitches, high anxiety, heart palpitations and feeling my heartbeat ( a weird symptom which further gives anxiety).

Did ECG and ECHO several times and it came normal except for sinus tachycardia or sinus arrythmia as I get nervous in hospitals and with fear the heart rate goes above 100 in hospitals.

The thing is I want to work on my low levels of Vit B12 finding proper cause rather just taking meds which most docs do here. No doc cares to look for the real cause and I hardly request them to take my b12 tests. And am not a vegan so such low levels of B-12 should not happen.

B-Complex
Krill Oil (with high EPA)
Tulsi
Ashawangdha

Milk Thistle

I also started Lorazepam 5 weeks ago and Lexapro 9 days ago. I also started back on Concerta a year and a half ago. 

Back to the ZMA-5. What I didn’t realize is that (5) is 5-HTP. 5-HTP and Lexapro and Concerta can cause serotonin syndrome. Very dangerous. This week each day I started feeling weirder and having odd symptoms. Very stiff knee, stiff feet, stiff back, headache, full body sweating for 48 hours, insane amounts of diarrhea, and body agitation. Felt like my nerves where shaking.  Low and behold mild-to-middle level symptoms of serotonin syndrome. It’s deadly if not treated. I decided to just discontinue use of 5-HTP, Lexapro (for a few days until I can talk to my doctor), and take Lorazepam because they use it to prevent seizure and relax the agitation if I went to ER. I also took a warm bath and drank a ton of water to hydrate up. Started feeling better within a 30 mins from the Lorazepam. Taking Sunday off from Lexapro and Concerta until I can talk to my doctor to see how I should proceed. 

I feel lucky that I read up on various interactions that my supplements and meds can have. Hopefully I’m out of the woods, but be warned!

Why is life like that ? I noticed when I do something that I like to do or watch , it feels effortless or I have the energy to do it. But when I got to go to work , I know what you're thinking , I'm not lazy, I just don't like the work that I do but I have to do it for my bills until I find another job. Anyways when I go to work I have to force myself to get up from the bed and do it. And yes that life there are things that you don't want to do but you have to do it. Like going to the doctor, dentist, college, etc. Well college isn't bad it's probably was my life outside of college that made the experience not so good. Then I really don't have any friends either. People always looked at me as weird , akward so know what that means , people automatically run away from those type of people . That's why you see people like myself that have autism or any type of disability by themselves because society doesn't really like or responds well to these disabilities (autism , bipolar , ADHD,etc. The only people that respond well to maybe people in the medical field, therapists, or some of your family members because they know your condition, or someone has these differences that you have. Other than that you pretty much alone because society is pretty much superficial and general when it comes to norms and values and when your different out of the pod people look at you funny . There is nothing good about being an outcast. Sometimes I wish I was more street, gangster , drug dealer so I can have people  respect  me more . I know what you're going to say don't look for other people validation for self worth. I know that but let's be real and ladies I won't want to sound like I'm disrespecting I'm not saying about all women but just some so don't get upset please. Do  some go for the nice guy or bad guy?, be honest yall. Some of them say they go for the nice guy but actions speak otherwise.  Then bad guys gets the most respect from other men . Look at the streets dudes that come of out jail everybody is happy to see him because he is that ""nigga"" that did his time. All of his homies is capping him up and it's probably not hard for him to attract a chick either . I'm not saying all of them are like that cause I don't want y'all to get mad but it's true. I gotta keep repeating that because y'all going to say incel or whatever. Probably didn't help that I was black called nerdy/ good guy and I was in the hood at the same time. And I still deal with it till this day because thats how people react when you comes from the streets people automatically respect you. Look at music/ social media / even in high school/ college. Tell me if I'm lying or not ? So people love nerdy, Christian, awkward people with disabilities? Come on man let's be for real . Some people like that but it's a small percentage/ overlooked. You can find people like minded but it's very difficult to find someone with similar interests, mindset, etc. Does medication make you weird to people ? Then again even before people always that people always looked at me like I had 3 eyes .  know I was yapping but this isn't meant to be a post that y'all look at on tittok.

Unlivemeplz,Anxiety attack I guess,1,1blh40m,0,"I'm a 23 year old female with severe anxiety studying abroad. I'm having a downward spiral right now about finding work. Here's some context I guess , I'm originally from a shitty country which is not doing so well economically it's a crisis.

They qre also providing for my older  sister. I am studying painting. 

Basically I'm panicking because there might come a time where I have to work to provide for myself and finish my studies but I have no skills whatsoever , never worked before , am not fluent in the language of the country I'm studying in yet and study from 10 to 6 pm most days. 
I'm just so tired and my brain is obsessing over this right now and I've been searching for jobs for the past two hours to no avail . I can't calm down, I can't sleep and I feel like such a failure. And I'm worried I will never be able to live normally never have enough skills to work.i am afraid of the future.
I've been taking medication for my anxiety for 2 years now so I'm usually able to go through the day but today I forgot to take them and it's killing me. How bad of a failure I am.

I will see my psychiatrist again in June, which means I'm gonna be on benzo for 11 weeks before seeing her again and I know it's not suggested to take benzo for more than 8-12 weeks including a period of gradual suspension. I don't know what to do, a part of me wants to call her and ask her if it's necessary to take also benzo, but since she knows I'm a medical student and I already studied a part of this stuff,  I'm scared it would look like I think I can treat my depression by myself lol

CaptainMarvel79,My personal experience with psychiatric medications.,1,1blaei1,0,"After 3 months of taking Sertraline 100mg once a day and 10mg of buspirone twice a day(prescribed by psychiatrist), I am ready to share my experience with you, especially with those who judged me for not visiting a psychiatrist. In the first week I did not notice any difference, no side-effects, and no improvements. After week one the nightmare began: Brain fog: I had concentration, judgement, and decision-making impairment. I couldn’t even concentrate on a simple topic like listening to news on the radio. I couldn’t make a decision between two basic options like: Should I read a book now or watch TV? Headache feeling: a mixed feeling between headache and lightheadedness. Constipation: passing bricks instead of, oh you know, normal things. Excessive tiredness and daytime sleepiness: I felt extreme fatigue all the time, day and night. I couldn’t complete a simple task. I couldn’t even do my daily personal tasks appropriately. Weight gain and sweets craving: I was hungry all the time and I wanted nothing but sweets, specifically chocolate donuts. I gained 6 kilograms of extra weight. Sounds so nice and life-giving? I don’t think so. Agitation: What is your reaction if someone accidentally kicked your leg? Any sane person would react: “no problem ma’am/sir”. But when you take these pills, you will react so strongly to such minor issues that you will immediately regret your nasty reaction. Muscle fatigue (muscle rigidity): I had pain and spasm in my shoulders and neck area, no matter what position I was in.
🚨Warning🚨: in the following i will say things that psychiatrists won't like, but these are truth. So if you are a psychatrist i recommend you to don't read this if you dont want to get hurt.
Taking into account the things I said above. I came to the conclusion that I became unhappy and hated myself because these characteristics that these pills had imposed on me were completely in conflict with my personality characteristics, which was an active and lively person. And this personality conflict made me hate myself. Because I had a desire to do an activity efficiently, but these problems caused by the pills prevented me from reaching my goal. Until one day, I decided to throw this garbages that the psychiatrists call them medication into the trash bin and I stopped using them. After almost a week of stopping the drugs, I returned to my normal state and was freed from that painful nightmare. And finally, I believed in my own opinion that psychiatry is not a science but a fraud. Pharmaceutical companies produce poisons under the name of medicine, and fraudsters under the name of psychiatrists are responsible for distributing these poisons. This is an unethical business. The doctor profits from the money the patient pays for the visit, and the pharmaceutical company profits from the sale of its poisons. When you visit a psychiatrist, you have one or two problems that you want to solve. But by giving you these poisons, the psychiatrist increases your pain and suffering so that you have to go to him again and pay, and instead he prescribes new poisons for you that double your problems and you go to him again until You realize that you have become dependent on him and his drugs. Yes, you are the credit card that psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies are constantly draining it.",1711142223.0,

I live alone for the first time and with that came me no longer giving a flying f what I ate because no one was there to judge me. Multiple times a week I’d crack and end up drinking almost a bottle of wine and then doordashing a HUGE unhealthy meal just to feel something, and almost every weekend when I go out with friends I’d come home and order drunk food, and then the next day hungover I’d order breakfast lunch and dinner all super super unhealthy. This has been a continuous cycle and I’m so ashamed and disgusted with myself. I don’t even want to know how much money I’ve wasted by ordering takeout and living my life revolving around food and alcohol. The truth is I love to drink wine and eat, it makes me insanely happy. 

I think the reason I love drinking alone and ordering food is because food just tastes better when you’re drunk and it makes it all more exciting. The thrill of ordering, waiting for it to arrive and then going to town. 

I know that to resolve this I have to stop drinking, but I’m a single 27 year old girl who lives in NYC and I feel like the city REVOLVES around eating and drinking.

Despite it all, significant progress has been made and I'm very proud of myself. It has been a very challenging experience. However, I find myself anxious over the progress I'm making. Mostly because... I don't want to relapse to the place I was a few months ago. I'm scared that the effort I'm putting in right now, will become too tiring to consistently expend. It feels not that it's a matter of ""if"" but a matter of ""when"" I'll inevitably slip up and fall back down into the pit. Some days are harder than others, but the will to keep going feels fickle, like it's able to be unearthed by just a simple breeze. I feel fragile right now and it's hard to be confident in myself and my abilities when I feel so weak. I know logically this all takes strength but man, how can so many people before, after, and during my time live a full life when a lot of the time, circumstances are much worse than my own.

How can I have faith in my ability to accomplish what I want in life when I don't even have faith in myself to  get through university, or to show up to work and not fear it like it's life threatening. How am I going to be a functioning member in society when I struggle so much with these things? 

I've learned how susceptible my mind is to external factors that alter the way I think. Trying new meds and realizing that they made my anxiety worse forced me to confront my own humanity. That my thoughts, while my own, can be easily influenced by silly hormones. Sometimes, happiness feels like a lie we tell ourselves to endure the unintentional malevolence this planet produces.

Yeah some days I continue to overthink. Some days I can't muster the energy to do anything. And some days now, I'm happy and I can do the things that I need to do.

I am deeply ashamed of my cowardice and hate myself for it.

I'm also afraid of people in charge of me- that they might be angry at me or ask me to do something I'm afraid of doing.  I also am full of self-loathing because of this.

So it seems like no matter what job I do I will be suffering from incredible anxiety.   I make feeble attempts at desensitizing myself to my fear by facing them.  But some event usually comes and undoes all of the desentesitization I have developed.

Most recently I ended up in the psych ward at the hospital for a week and now I am on a leave of absence from work.  I've had to desensitize myself to things as simple as meeting with friends.  I am so terrified of going back to my job.  But even if I found another job I would still have to face tremendous fear.

I don't know what to do.  I hate living like this.  My fear makes me not want to live but I am too afraid to die.

Someone who can put in as much effort into their friendships as they do. I'm so grateful to have them, but I know that I'm not a good friend. I'm selfish and I keep on trying to fix myself and be better for them but I struggle so much. 

I always wonder about the day that they'll see the truth. That I'm not worth their time and effort. They give me encouraging words, but how long will that last before they're sick of it? Before they're sick of me? Before they pull forward and I'm left behind?

But I'm a loser, so I'll stay until they don't want me anymore. I'll try to give as much love back as possible before I go because I don't have much in me. I'm slow, I'm dumb, I'm clumsy, so all I can do is try to reciprocate.

A few days ago, in a haze of desperation and curiosity, I delved into the abyss of drug experimentation, unaware of the impending chaos that would ensue. Trapped in a whirlwind of impulsive decisions and a misguided search for euphoria, I embarked on a perilous journey fueled by ignorance and desperation.

The allure of a makeshift high beckoned from the depths of our medicine cabinet, tempting me with promises of a fleeting escape from the confines of my troubled mind. With reckless abandon, I reached for the nausea pills containing Dramamine, oblivious to the Pandora's box I was about to open. Little did I know, the line between euphoria and madness was perilously thin, blurred by the potent cocktail of chemicals coursing through my veins.

In the grip of intoxication, I surrendered to a kaleidoscope of hallucinations, each more sinister than the last. Reality warped and twisted, morphing into a nightmarish landscape devoid of coherence or solace. The peaceful high I had naively anticipated gave way to a haunting descent into the depths of drug-induced psychosis.

Hours melded into days, each moment a hazy blur of fragmented memories and fleeting lucidity. The pills, once a beacon of escape, became shackles binding me to a harrowing reality I could scarcely comprehend. As I traversed the labyrinth of my fractured mind, I grappled with the terrifying realization that a single misstep could plunge me into the abyss of irreparable damage.

The discovery of my mother's potent oxy pills nestled among my sheets served as a chilling reminder of the precarious precipice upon which I teetered. The consequences of my reckless indulgence loomed ominously, threatening to unravel the very fabric of my being.

Alone with my thoughts, I surrendered to the cacophony of voices echoing through the corridors of my mind. Vivid hallucinations danced before my eyes, beckoning me into a surreal realm where the boundaries of reality dissolved into oblivion. With each passing moment, I battled to discern truth from illusion, clinging to the vestiges of sanity that eluded my grasp.

In a desperate bid for salvation, I reached out to loved ones, their voices a lifeline amidst the chaos engulfing me. Yet, even their reassurances could not quell the storm raging within. Time stretched and contorted, its passage a cruel mockery of the linear reality I once knew.

As the haze of intoxication gradually lifted, I confronted the stark reality of my actions with a newfound clarity. The toll of my recklessness weighed heavy upon my conscience, a stark reminder of the fragility of the human psyche in the face of chemical temptation.

Today, as I stand on the precipice of redemption, I am acutely aware of the dangers that lurk beneath the veneer of euphoria. The journey to recovery is fraught with peril, yet I am determined to confront my demons head-on. With the unwavering support of my family and the promise of a brighter tomorrow, I embark on a quest for healing and redemption.

May my story serve as a cautionary tale, a testament to the perils of drug experimentation and the indomitable resilience of the human spirit. For in the crucible of adversity, we discover the strength to rise from the ashes and forge a new path towards a brighter future.

Vast-Name4165,Im getting depressed from these thoughts.,1,1biphta,0,"Since a couple months I’m constantly comparing my boyfriend to his elder brother in terms of career.
Let me give some context:

My boyfriend (24) and I (24) have been together for 7 years. We both got our first jobs in 2021. He earns £36000 yearly in a marketing career but has a student debt with a minimum fixed monthly payment of £550. He also helps his family by sending them £250 monthly. 

His brother (26) got his first job in Germany earning €64000 yearly in technology industry. He however has no student loan. 

I have been constantly comparing the career situation as I am worried my boyfriend will be lacked behind in life and will not be as successful as his brother.
Since the cost of living, rent, travel expenses in UK are quite higher compared to Germany, which means along with loan we have a lot less disposable income. 

I have discussed this with my boyfriend and he always treats these emotions very respectfully and consoles me that its all fine but regardless I cannot stop my brain from thinking this.

My boyfriend is very driven and he will be successful I’m sure of that, but I am not able to stop comparing at all and being worried all the day about his brother having a more comfortable and better life than my boyfriend.

Please provide me with some solutions as I know this is bad and can then start working towards the problem",1710868269.0,
Difficult_Hyena1179,I need help but I don’t ask for it,2,1bibbra,2,"TLDR at the bottom 

Wasn’t sure which flair to add, probably more anxiety help, but also depression help

(22m) So I guess the reason I’m posting this is because I think I should ask my parents or a friend for help. But I continually hide my pain. I only will share it if someone really prys it out of me. 

I am so uncomfortable with reaching out about something like this. It gives me very deep shame and embarrassment/feeling stupid. Easier on Reddit I guess.

I go through high highs and low lows. When I’m in my highs I sort of forget that I was struggling or don’t care to think about it because I don’t want to ruin my good feelings. Then in my lows I don’t have the energy or motivation to get help.

 I just wait until someone happens to really ask how I am.

Anxiety, depression, adhd. Working my first office job, 6 months in. I’ve had hard weeks but overall it’s been manageable. But now I am pretty burnt out and mental health is exponentially tanking/spiraling. 

I am so afraid of getting fired or quitting because I felt so proud that I have a stable and well paying job, that will lead to career opportunities. I have told many people about my job and how it’s great and felt so proud idk.

On paper, I have a really good life. Parents are pretty well off, have always raised me and siblings in a loving and caring way, I am athletic, good genes, live in a beautiful city, my office job has a pretty relaxed environment, my boss does not micro manage at all, I know a lot of guys who i skateboard and snowboard with, I have guitar and drums as an outlet. I’ve gone to therapy and learned skills for managing my emotions. 

Despite all this, I currently feel anxious often, insecure, depressed/hopeless. I think about how I wish to die every day pretty much, the last week it’s been almost every minute. 

I really don’t think I would, motivated by the amount of pain I would cause my family, the way people close to me would see me as a coward/giving up/selfish. It would be such a waste of a good life.

But i wish so badly that no one knew me and I could die and no one would care.

The depression and anxiety sucks but the shame of it makes it twice as bad. I shouldn’t struggle this much - there’s people with extremely significantly harder lives that are managing to keep going, so the fact that I want to give up makes me feel like a weak and pathetic human. I know I shouldn’t compare but I do I guess.

(TLDR)

So anyways, I just don’t understand why I let myself struggle alone and want to be alone in these things. It’s almost like I know if I have mental struggles I will be allowed to take the easier route/quit my job or relax I don’t know.

I just know I need to talk to someone or it will keep spiraling. I feel so trapped and alone. But it’s so hard to reach out, to be the one to initiate contact, makes me feel so stupid and lame.",1710820884.0,
Supe_scienceskilz,My anxious household is a nightmare right now-I’m trying to hold it together ,2,1bia48s,2,"The last three years have been so destructive thanks to my anxiety. I have tried four different medications, a mood enhancer, and tried two different therapists (found the right one in 2022). About eight months ago, my husband was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety and it is causing lots of disagreements. 

First he was convinced that he didn’t have anxiety. Then he gave medication a try and it made a huge difference. He also started seeing a therapist and for or a period of three months, both of us showed some improvement. Unfortunately, he is back to believing he doesn’t have anything wrong and has stopped taking meds. He quit therapy secretly as well. His anxiety is back to where it was before diagnosis and now it’s making mine worse. He gets so angry if anyone says he seems different. I’m walking on broken glass with hope that no one hears it crunching under my feet. 
I feel like I’m going backwards. And now I am anxious about devolving completely and undoing all the work of the past three years (which has helped me understand 3 decades anxieties )",1710817194.0,

I am 18 years old and just rot in my room all day, I have no friends and am failing college. I don’t have my drivers licence and I’m in a long distance relationship and see them once or twice a week. I feel like a burden to my partner because I can’t drive. He’s been trying to teach me but I can’t help but feel like he secretly hates me for it, my parents won’t teach me to drive and get mad at me for not having a job, I live in a small town and there’s no jobs here so I’d have to drive 30 minutes into the next town. I had a temporary job at my moms work and was trying so hard to save money but I almost have nothing left, I try to help my boyfriend with gas or get food for him but I won’t be able to anymore and I’d feel useless because he’s driving to see me every time. I love to bake and have started a small business but my parents are wanting me to get a degree in college. My parents aren’t paying for it and I know they don’t have to but I don’t know what I want to be and I’m scared I’ll get into something I won’t like. Ever since I graduated I just have been constantly pressured into having to grow up and get my shit together really fast. I’m the oldest from my siblings and the only girl. I have never been allowed to really go out much in high school and  recently I’ve been going out with my boyfriend more and going places and they think I’m rebelling against them all the time. had to move senior year to a new school and thought I’d made friends but after graduation I’d be the only one reaching out, I have depression and anxiety and it’s been really difficult to live these past few weeks and feel like doing things I shouldn’t. I tried telling my boyfriend but I don’t think he’d understand. I don’t have the best relationship with my parents and they don’t talk to me unless it’s to lecture me about how I can’t drive or get a job or school. I feel trapped in my house and feel like I disappoint everyone. I don’t know what to do and I feel overwhelmed.

Cryptid_Jacob97,It feels so emasculating to cry.,1,1bibunw,1,"(27 M)Needless to say, but I’ve always struggled with anxiety and chronic depression, but recently I’ve hit a rough patch in my life. Full of loss, death, isolation, and I even broke my hand back in November. Now I feel like I’m always crying, sometimes at random, and it makes me feel so weak. I’ve tried the breathing exercises and I’ve even tried to harden my heart (which I know isn’t the best way to go about things). Most times it’s due to something happening or me getting lost in my thoughts but sometimes it’s just random like I’ll wake up in the middle of the night, while driving, in the shower, etc. Now at home, with parents/ grandparents, or where no one can see me is one thing but now I’m crying at work. As a single grown man, it just feels emasculating, especially if I notice women around. Not only do I feel weak but I’m afraid others will think I am or worse think I want sympathy or attention (which I don’t). I’ve been told that I need to accept that I have a “tender” or “caring” heart and that it doesn’t make me less of a man but as an “old fashioned” minded man, I still hate it. Sorry for the wind!

BrentD22,Life has been a lie,5,1bhs06a,11,"For the past 27 years I knew my high school “completion” was bogus and I did not officially graduate. It was never a problem. I had 3 main positions and there was never a time anyone confirmed. Until now… all the jobs in my field have a requirement of official documents to verify. 

I’m 45 and I know I’m completely screwed. I could have corrected this years ago, but just kept moving because I needed to. My job prospects have just been limited so much. 

I know I can go take the HiSet but how do I explain to my prospective employer that I only just finished it? That’s a massive red flag.

I can’t quit trying, but I don’t know what the fuck I’m going to do. Even though every cell in my body is saying “just end it” I can’t.

rootcanal4,I don't understand...,1,1bi4mvr,2,"I have been doing good.  I have a lot further to go. I just started taking Clonazepam last Friday.  I'm also now volunteering five days a week.  
As strange as this sounds, I have no income.  I possibly could but I wasn't able to submit all of my necessary documents for general assistance 9 months ago.  I was working to complete community services for court and became ill on the job.  I spent five days in the hospital having tests done to find out why I was so dizzy.  Was diagnosed with peripheral vertigo.  Had to get an extension with the courts until I got better.  Less than a month after my extension, I fainted while walking and landed face first onto cement.  I got 3 facial fractures.  Had to have surgery and then recover.  I was inactive during both incidents.  I hit my head hard and got memory loss.

I have PTSD already.  I've had a lot hit me at once.  I qualify for SSI but I didn't fill out my paperwork correctly when I applied so I got denied.  I need to reapply but I need help.  I'm now doing community service again to finish my court order.  I felt good to be around people.  I'm making changes but am unable to multitask. I have severe anxiety.  My psychiatrist put me on Klonopin due to the severity of my panic attacks and so many of them.
I got triggered a bit ago when my case worker said I need to start my Hussle. I'm horrible at this.  I'm very shy.  And get scared.  And I panic and get depressed.  
I already took my dose of medication today.  I had another panic attack and went into depression.  
I have never done the Hussle thing.  I don't know how to without shaking.  
All of this got set off because I needed toilet paper and I am only supposed to get one roll a month.  That's when she told me to Hussle.

Hi Reddit this is my first ever post.
I really need some guidance as I can feel I I’m getting closer and closer to a depression. 

The story.
Summer last year I suddenly began feeling numbness in my left leg and left hand (I could still use them though, but walked a little funny). 
And I also had a weird feeling in my nose and mouth and felt my tongue felt extremely dry.
I went to the doctor and he send me to a neurologist. The neurologist suspected I had MS(and naturally I became very anxious). I had different blood tests done, spinal tap and neurologist wanted me to get an MR scan with contrast. 
I had the MR scan done but for some reason without contrast. 
All the results were negative for MS.
And I was happy and gradually after months the numbness fade away but the weird sensation in my mouth and nose is still there to this day.
About 4 month ago the left side of my back and hip became incredibly stiff and hurt bad when I went from sitting to standing and still is.
2 weeks ago my left leg began to feel numb again and I had some kind of uncomfortable pressure on my chest - had my heart and lung checked nothing wrong there.
A couple of days ago I began having visible fasciculations 24/7 in my calves when I relax as well as foot cramps and my left side feels stiff when I’m walking and i sometimes have ringing In one of my ears as well as nerves jumping in different parts of my body.

I must admit I am incredibly anxious about having MS or some other kind of neurological disease even though the prior test were negative. (I am especially worried because I did not have contrast when I did the MR scan)
I have had the thought of it being anxiety but the physical symptoms are very strong.

It might be important to add that blood tests don’t show any lack of vitamins.

I really hope someone in here have had similar experiences or know what I could do from now since this is affecting my life to the point of having trouble going through the day.

I’ve noticed that when I fap excessively, these psychological symptoms worsen - makes sense right? But also, when I go on nofap, these psychological symptoms also worsen, which you’d normally not expect due to the hormonal changes associated with nofap . I am thinking this is due to withdrawal effects as a result of nofap but I’m not sure. In fact, my anxiety and depression is at its lowest at an equilibrium point of fapping once per 2 days, but I am still having psychological effects even then.  I really think my PMO addiction is causing these mental issues. I’ve noticed a very strong correlation with my fapping & increased mental effects. There’s also been cases of PMO addiction tampering with hormone levels and causing increased levels of depression and anxiety. Do you think that it’s possible my PMO addiction is the underlying cause to my anxiety & depression and is causing hormonal changes? If so, then after how long after I quit fapping can I expect for the psychological symptoms subside and I’ll be normal again? The reason I ask this is because I mentioned before that my anxiety and depression flare up after I quit fapping, so how long before this subsides and I’ll have no more anxiety and depression to worry about?

i just feel impaired recently in such a way that i cant move forward in the career i want to pursue and i just stay inside my house and sleep almost all day or just stare somewhere and isolate myself from everyone. i know it is not as bad as when i was first diagnosed (like suicidal and having nightly panic attacks and cant sleep)… but i hate that im like this. i know progress isnt linear but i still feel stuck. maybe anyone here has a similar experience right now and maybe we can help each other out.

I figured it was better than nothing so I've mostly just stayed on Prozac. However, at one point I was briefly put on Paxil instead and it completely got rid of my anxiety.  It was crazy. Unfortunately it made my depression severely worse so I stopped and went back to Prozac, which got my depression back under control. Now I'm doing intensive therapy (EMDR) and it's naturally healing my anxiety, much of which is actually due to CPTSD.

From what I've observed, **I don't believe** that experiences of depression are unique and special. Instead, it seems that individuals grappling with social depression often **share similar causes, symptoms, and approaches to treatment.**

I become frustrated with individuals go to therapy and take medication but neglect to follow their treatment plan. They fail to adopt healthy habits, make little effort to connect with others, and, most concerning of all, refuse to even get out of bed. It's particularly disheartening when someone won't make the effort to get out of bed because it suggests a lack of willingness to try to improve their situation.

Everyone agreed its offensive. I was called a troll, stubborn, close-minded, crazy. If you are depressed and don't try actively to improve that. how are you getting better, make it make sense

views4pewds,I’m now realizing it’s constant,2,1bdxj70,12,"I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for about 4-5 years now and it’s always been something I brushed off. I just turned 18 and every single day has felt like a battle. For probably around 6 months I have been constantly anxious, just carrying around a giant heavy pit in my stomach. There has not been a day in these past months when I felt at ease. I can’t hang out with my friends, i can’t sleep, i can’t eat. I hate leaving the house and having to act like i’m not rotting, and that my anxiety isn’t physically debilitating.

Along with that I realized it actually isn’t normal to genuinely want to kys. Everyday I lay down to go to sleep and I think, every single time, “i can’t do it anymore, i’m so exhausted, it never gets better” Every single day i have to battle the thoughts of just ending it all. I don’t know what’s more frustrating, these thoughts or the fact I know full heartedly that I am human and death is final. And i haven’t really pressed that yet, and the thought of what’s after scares me. I’m too pussy basically. 

“erm go to therapy” STOP PLEASEEE😭 I went to therapy for a very long time, but my circumstances growing up have made it very difficult to open up and actually talk about it. Also i have a profound self awareness but lack the motivation to actually make a difference. I think i just don’t believe i will ever be happy. And honestly I am on medication, and i don’t take it. I took it for awhile but it just made everything worse. And quite frankly i’m embarrassed of the person i am. I hate myself and who i’ve become. the guilt from the people i’ve hurt plagues me everyday. Telling that to another person? I have enough judgment on my own.

,"Phrase ""we are not our thoughts"" caused me slight dissociation - asking for HELP.",4,1bdliut,9,"I have been reading about this concept, and it has only caused me pain. So if if I think about how much I like certain song then it's a lie? Things I enjoy immensely always find a way to transfer from my emotions to my thoughts, and I always found it helpful towards the journey of self discovery. We have so many complex systems that work as one whole now tell me how does that not shape or personality and who we are.. So every single thing that my thoughts tell me I enjoy, is a lie? Every observation I have in the outside world where: I meet a random person and I like them and I think to myself that I really do like them, then everything I think to myself in any kind of a situation is false, and it has nothing to do with me? Even the way we write, what we write about has traces of our personality - and it comes from our thoughts.. I find it impossible to believe that our thoughts are not connected to our personality in any way. In a lot of ways they guide us towards her interests, our Hobbies, our relationships, so how can none of it be apart of who we are? Can someone tell me that some of our some of our thoughts are apart of our personality, because now I feel my interests are meaningless my relationships are meaningless my taste in anything I like is meaningless because anything my thoughts tell me I like is apparently false and and tells us nothing about ourselves... I'll give you an example I see something I like, then I have a thought that the thing I see looks amazing, and then that same thought produces an emotion that makes me feel good, and at the same time I discover what I like. So tell me how how the thoughts we have are not stepping stones towards ourselves.  
  
**I see a point in not identifying with our bad or intrusive thoughts, as a part of self-help when your in therapy... But we shouldn't discredit all our thoughts as a part of ourselves, they play an important part in forming our identity, just as our feelings and behavior. They are all interconnected.**  
  
**Why the phrase lacks logic:**  
○ Before your discovered your interests and hobbies, you had an emotional feeling about a particular thing then thought to yourself ""I really like this, I want to do it again"", the emotion got translated into your thought - some parts of your thoughts helped you find your likes/dislikes and are as such - a part of you.  
○ Before you do most of the things in everyday life - whether make a new friend, call your current friend, make food that YOU find tasty, what do you do? You think about how good it tasted in the past and that you want to make it again. Your thoughts were again apart of YOU and what YOU like.  
○ When you search for a new job, and you want to find something that's aligned with your own desires and wishes, what do you do? You THINK about it and based on the THOUGHTS, and the ones you'll listen to (the ones you follow: and are again apart of YOU and your personality) will play a huge role in your life direction.  
○ Through a psychological test where students wrote random thoughts on a piece of paper, psychologists acquired many traces of their personality - just based off that, and it was mostly accurate.  
○ **We are not all of our thoughts but many of our thoughts tell us about who who we actually are**/they help us discover about or wants/preferences, about what we don't want and so much.  
○ Where we currently are in life is a place where we travelled to based on the thoughts we chose to work with.  
○ **Personality is a pattern of thought, feeling, and behavior, but little attention has been paid to thoughts** \- John A. Johnson, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University.  
○ A new person we like and speak to regularly makes us feel a certain type of way - then t**hat emotion gets transferred to our thoughts**: ""I want to go out with this person, they make me feel good about myself, I like how many simillar things we share"" - based on our thinking we pursue that interest.  
  
I just think that quote is false (**has some truth in when it comes to self-help or bad thoughts but is not entirely right**, - at the same time it causes me agony), and that thoughts, emotions and genetics are one of many parts that make us who we are. We have thoughts about our interests, likes, our love lives, if we didn't follow up with any of our thoughts we wouldn't develop any of the things i just mentioned.  
**My opinion is (also based on research is) that some of our thoughts tell us nothing of ourselves and are indeed intrusive, and cause nothing but harm. But a lot of them are connected to our emotions, our personality/personal tastes, our inner drives and play an equal role as many other things (emotions, genetics, family cirmustances, etc.) that play a role and give shape to what we are.**  
  
**Quotes from different internet sources**: ""Personalities contain the patterns of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that make each person unique. Together, these aspects can play a role in every part of our lives, from friendships to careers, to hobbies"". ""Thoughts: The Neglected Aspect of Personality: Personality is a pattern of thought, feeling, and behavior, but little attention has been paid to thoughts. The point is that all three aspects of what textbook author David Funder (2019) called the psychological triad—thoughts, feelings, and behavior—are equally important. - John A. Johnson, Ph.D, professor of psychology"". ""Thoughts are ideas, perspectives, opinions, and beliefs that influence our emotions, actions, and habits. They can be positive or negative, and they play a significant role in shaping our personality.""  
  
**I am talking about this subject from a psychological/scientific point of view, not from any kind of spiritual/philosophical way of thinking.**  
  
Are some of our thoughts part of our personality, our genetic makeup and our nature? Do they play a role in shaping personality? Do they tell us something about our values, beliefs, and bottom line: ourselves? I feel like thoughts/thought patterns, emotions, genetics, etc... All play equal role in shaping who we are (our personality).

PuzzleheadedNature39,Difficult timing ,1,1bdpp8r,0,"I'm currently dealing with the loss of a friend of over eight years. She recently left a place we used to work at together due to being hurt by a comment someone made towards her. She often has difficulty resolving conflicts, and as a result, she abruptly left. Shortly before her departure, she called me and told me about the plans she had at the job. I found out that she didn't really want to leave as she told everyone it was for a different reason. She was just unable to resolve the situation. 

 I've seen her in public once for sure and possibly today at the supermarket since we don't live far from each other. The first time was on a check outline. Once she realized it was me, she moved away quickly to the next line. The second sighting, possibly today, she saw me as I was coming down an escalator at Whole Foods, and she turned around facing the produce and texting on the phone. The reason it's hard to recognize her is because she always wears a mask and a hood or a hat. 

The somewhat funny thing is that we both have social anxiety, and she won't reach out to me and vice versa. However, her absence has really triggered me I was already having a difficult time prior to this and this just gave me the boost I really needed (sarcasm).  To be honest I'd never thought I'd miss her so much and I'm having a difficult time reaching out since she's avoiding me I thought it'd be better to just give her space. 

I know not reaching out to her is due to my own fear of loss coupled with the fear on her face from seeing me and her detachment from me and other's in that space.

As I mentioned I'm currently struggling with my own anxiety and I'm going to therapy and going out with friends and overall trying to keep busy. I know these things take time,  this relationship is just something that's been constantly eating at me for a while and making my face go like this 😬.. (that's my going insane face)

Minddoesntstop,Finding courage in change: a journey of growth and opportunity ,2,1bd8rib,1,"Change is a constant in life, yet for many of us, it’s a daunting prospect that pushes us out of our comfort zones and into the unknown. My journey is a testament to the transformative power of change, as I navigated the ups and downs of stepping into unfamiliar territory, finding my voice, and embracing new opportunities.

Growing up, I was always the quiet one, hesitant to speak up and afraid that my opinions didn’t hold value compared to others’. This fear followed me into the working world, where I struggled with anxiety and self-doubt as I searched for my place. It wasn’t until I found myself in a kitchen environment that things began to change.

Cooking has always been my passion, and working in a kitchen allowed me to express myself in ways I never thought possible.

Despite facing challenges from colleagues who underestimated me due to my appearance and perceived abilities, I pushed forward, proving my worth with hard work, attention to detail, and a genuine love for what I do.

Over time, I rose through the ranks, gaining confidence and recognition for my skills. Yet, when presented with the opportunity to explore new horizons, I hesitated. The prospect of leaving my comfort zone was terrifying, but deep down, I knew it was necessary for my growth.

I took a leap of faith and ventured into new environments, from a small bistro to one of Ontario’s largest golf courses. Each experience brought its own set of challenges and rewards, from navigating complex kitchen equipment to learning from world-class chefs. Despite the initial nerves and uncertainties, I thrived in these new environments, expanding my skills and broadening my perspective.

However, when my old boss offered me a chance to return to familiar grounds, I found myself torn. The allure of comfort and familiarity was strong, but deep down, I knew I craved more. It was a tough decision, but ultimately, I chose to embrace change once again, knowing that it was the key to unlocking my full potential.

Now, as I prepare to embark on a new chapter at Cafe 13, I’m filled with a mix of excitement and nerves. The thought of starting over with unfamiliar faces is daunting, but I remind myself of the growth and opportunities that lie ahead.

For those facing similar crossroads, my advice is simple: embrace change with an open mind and a courageous heart. It may be scary at first, but stepping out of your comfort zone is where true growth happens. Surround yourself with supportive individuals who believe in your abilities, and never underestimate the power of perseverance.

Remember, change is not a destination but a journey, and each step forward opens doors to new possibilities. So take that leap of faith, and who knows? You may just soar to heights you never thought possible.",1710277993.0,

I know I need to fix my life

I'm relatively good academically (or I was while I still cared about life) and it just makes me more hopeless to know that I could actually have potential in the world if I could just care

I used to have so many interests but thats just gone out of the window, I dont like or love anything or anyone anymore either

There's no way forward, im just stuck and i often feel like im spectating life and watching everyone else fly past me and make something of their life

I hate myself and my life and my situation so much and then i also feel guilt for even having mental health problems because in theory my life is a really good situation

Everyone in my family is basically perfect and genius, so obviously they were all 'shocked' when they realized I wasn't 'ok', and my dad is basically still in denial.

Psychiatrist also said I should get evaluated for ADHD but again my parents are in denial

I've been recommended to start meds for insomnia, anxiety and depression ASAP but for some reason I'm terrified of any medication so that won't happen, and the last time I tried talking therapy it made my situation worse

I also completely understand that there are people in way worse situations that me, but I want to fix my life so that I can live up to people's unreal expectations of me and actually be happy but basically at this point I see no point because the world is sick and corrupt and shitty.

veryberryblue,Everything is fine until the early morning hours...,3,1bcxwgx,0,"First of all, I have a history of trauma, PTSD, GAD and depression...just to name a few!.

I always go to bed feeling relaxed and sleepy and fall right to sleep.

I sleep about 7-8 hours and then wake up and pee. I try to go back to sleep (as a form of avoidance/escape) but this is where it gets interesting.

Instead of sleeping, the next few hours are filled with anxious thoughts, flashbacks, hypnic jerks, a racing heart, ruminations and a feeling of fear/impending doom.

Finally, I just get up, have coffee, take my meds (Ativan and Atenolol) and start my day. An hour later, I am feeling just a little more calm but still shaken.

I have also gotten into a habit or obsession of taking my temp, BP and checking my body under the light for anything unusual. I do this every day. Sometimes multiple times.

I also get these wierd thoughts/memories that pop into my mind. Like something I saw in a video or an interaction I had with someone the previous day and even if they were harmless, I still get this jolt of anxiety.

This is gonna be a novel so let me say thank you for listening.

I’m 31, 6ft 4in, 400lbs (mostly cake probably) and every single health exam or test says I’m extremely healthy despite my weight. 

And I am irrationally terrified of my heart just plain stopping. It’s only getting worse. It’s ruined my life so far.

Before January 2020 I would have panic attacks yes but I was working through it at my own pace. I was on (still am on) Lexipro and Hydroxyzen. I was in the gym 4 days a week. I was running miles, I was swimming laps, playing tennis, on exercise bikes, lifting weights. Busting my ass to lose weight and try to get in better shape. I got myself down from 370 to about 330 and I was so damn proud of myself

But one day, in January 2020 I was out on a work call in a nearby city (I work in foster care and I was meeting some new kids that just got placed in a home) I had been feeling unusually anxious, more panicky, more scared. After that visit I went to the hospital. I was having a bad panic attack but something compelled me to just go I was terrified. At this small town ER they hooked me up to an EKG machine. They monitored me for a bit and when they came back the doctor sat down and said to me “there’s some kind of blip, for lack of a better word, on your EKG” I didn’t know what that meant for me. What he said after is what has doomed me to this day “Well we can’t rule out  heart attack so we think it’s best you transfer to the bigger hospital in the city over” 

That was it, it was just my time I guess. All the gym stuff all the time work and effort and it was just out the window. They transported me to the hospital. They gave me some kind of pill that opens up all the veins and arteries in your body wider “in the off chance you are having a heart attack” the EMT said to me on the way. The whole way there I just couldn’t stop thinking about that EKG. Just spacing out about it. 

When I did get to the big city hospital I was checked in hooked up to another EKG and given an IV. I laid there and I kept thinking “if I was having a heart attack wouldn’t I have had it by now?” There was just so so much to process but one thing I couldn’t stop was the thought that my hearts going to fail. The EKG at this hospital was showing just perfectly fine readings. They did more tests and concluded I had a severe respiratory infection which would later be diagnosed as Covid. The pandemic started maybe 2 months after that.

After I discharged from the hospital I felt like an absolute failure of a human being. A 27 (at the time) year old man having a heart attack after the last year working to improve myself in the gym. I dwelled on it. I spent the first week home and not in the gym. I tried to get back into the gym. I did not work

It’s been downhill ever since then. Anytime I would start to run or swim and I could feel my heartbeat rising or my breath getting short from the workout I would go into hyperventilating panic. I would cry I would stop and down my hydroxyzen and try to find something to keep my mind off it but I couldn’t. My stomach would be in knots and that would just set the whole process off because severe stomach pain is a symptom of a heart attack. It got so bad that even the thought of going to the gym gave me anxiety. My first hobby lost to this monster. I tried unsuccessfully to get myself into therapy but I never could find anyone in the field that couldn’t understand until I swapped psychiatrists and during one of our medication sessions she more or less diagnosed me with Cardiophobia. 

The monster had a name. 

As the months passed i couldn’t go near a gym. I started to have panic attacks just walking up and down stairs. If I ate too much or too little and my stomach started to hurt I panicked because it was a symptom. I have some nerve damage in my left arm due to an ancient and when it starts hurting it goes to heart attack because it’s my left arm and that’s a symptom. Too this DAY this is still the case. It’s been 4 years. 4 years of panic attacks almost daily. I’m now 400 pounds. My knees are hurting all the time now. My heart rate rises my sanity falls. I’ve gotten so big now that driving gives me anxiety. I feel like I can’t breath sometimes when I drive and again shortness of breath is a symptom of a heartattack. If I can’t drive I can’t work. I have to work those kids depend on me. I have student loans I have bills. It’s the simplest things. I’m a little dizzy? Heart attack. Upper back hurts? Probably a heart attack. God forbid I have just regular old gas that makes my chest tight. 

I’ve gone to the hospital so, so, so many times now.  I’ll get in the car and just in my head I have to have a plot to the nearest hospital because “hey my breathings about to get heavy and I’m gonna panic while driving” (and as soon as I think that, boom. It happens) I’ve had ambulances come to me, I’ve had coworkers do their best to calm me down, I’ve been a burden on so many people now because of this god awful irrational fear my hearts just going got quit. Every specialist I’ve been to, every exam I’ve ever had, every check up has the same result. I’m fine. I’m very healthy. My weight is up but that’s it. My labs are solid. I’m not diabetic. I’m not actively falling apart. But none of it matters. There’s always that “well what if it’s this time?” No one can ever truly know.

As I type this I have been having an anxiety panic attack since 8pm, it’s 5am my stomach won’t stop hurting. My anxiety and panic is evolving past I’m dying and going to I’m dying and I’m going to lose my sanity. I cry a lot these days now. I can’t help it anymore. I’ve lost so many hobbies and missed out on so much because I’m scared. Eventually I’m going to lose my job because I’ll be too afraid to get in my car anymore.

A friend of mine told me once I was scared to live.

How do you beat this? How do you take back control from something like that? I’m giving it another go at therapy and I’m deciding to try new medicine by changing my current meds. They just arnt working anymore. I’m hoping the new therapist will have better answers. I’m hoping maybe new medicine will help me to coping. One day, maybe I’ll be free

One day I’ll be in that gym again.",1710236078.0,
Zazdabar,Really struggle with these intrusive anxious thoughts … any advice please ,7,1bcik86,11," I find myself feeling like I did something wrong in my last interaction with someone and I hesitate to call , text see them out of my own will if I don’t hear from them in a set amount of time, could be days or weeks and my mind feels like that person is ignoring me, doesn’t want to see me even though nothing wrong happened between us in our previous interactions. I know it’s a problem and it’s my own insecurities playing in but I’ve recognized that it’s just not healthy to live and think this way. What often happens is I end up hearing from the person to find that there was no problem at all. I kind of recognized that I somewhat expect everything to be right all the time, even in how people will view, see me, I guess because a part of me is afraid to upset, hurt others. I started to tell myself when I have these intrusive thoughts that “everything doesn’t have to be right , perfect” and it calms me into a place where I have the courage to reach out and not wait on them but it’s still somewhat a struggle. Contacting, reaching out to people shouldn’t be challenging or riddled with anxiety when there is nothing wrong. I realize that I am self sabotaging potential great friendships , relationships with these intrusive anxieties and thoughts that overtake my logic and reasoning. Would anybody be able to offer any advice or help or their own experience with this ?

JPF-OG,My new method for digging out of a bad day.,8,1bc59c6,2,"1. Recognize it.  If you don't know why your mood is low continue to take positive steps in any direction. 
2. The next step doesn't need to be perfect.  Example: If you have not eaten yet today then eat something even if it's not super healthy or even the traditional type of food for that time of day and if that requires you getting a milkshake so be it (not that I'm about to totally do that).
3. Reassess.  Find another step you can take no matter how small it is.  Maybe that's taking a nap to try and reset things or taking a long hot shower.  Sometimes things like a hot shower that result in full body sensory experience that feels (to some anyway) calming and cozy help the brain get into a new pattern.  Basically put everything on the table.  No step is too small and don't let tradition, social conventions, previous patterns get in your way.

adulting_unhappily,"What do I do if I can't tell my parents something might be wrong? I think it's anxiety and depression, but I can't tell them and get help",1,1bca59h,2,"I (22F) have been getting stressed and really unhappy over the past few years for no reason; it was always manageable though, so I never said anything and just tried to ignore it. Usually it would get bad around stressful times (like final exams or job interviews) but would subside once the problem passed. Recently, it's gotten much worse, and is beginning to affect my everyday life (not severely, just making it harder and harder to get up in the mornings and eat). I'm still able to get things done, but it's much harder. I'm unhappy almost all the time and constantly feeling sick, even though I'm traveling like I always wanted.

  
It's gotten to the point where I'm beginning to wonder if something is actually wrong but both my sisters are having big problems. One is extremely depressed, bipolar, anxiety, and I heard my parents mention psychosis here and there. She's seeing a therapist and is on several medications. We don't know if she'll be able to go to college, it doesn't look very hopeful. She's made 2 suicide attempts thus far, and each time her meds change she has to be watched in case of a third; she actively resists efforts to reach her and has become very hostile to our mother in particular for no apparent reason. She was institutionalized for a few weeks earlier this year. My other sister had severe illness as a baby that everyone thought she would die from; she recovered but it left her with some physical aftereffects from the treatments; she's graduated and working but recently had another health scare (different kind, required lots of tests and other things I wasn't told about) and is having trouble with the people she works with not recognizing her efforts, like stealing credit/projects/bypassing her for promotions because of the way she looks. She's now thinking about trying to change jobs/companies and possibly where she's living (she's on the other side of the country right now). She also started seeing a therapist recently for mental health purposes, mom helped her find someone.

  
I'm mostly functional, just really stressed and unhappy. But I can still make it through each day, so I don't want to tell my parents. They both work full time and I don't want to add to their problems when I can still function normally while my sisters have such a hard time and my parents are trying to help both of them. My mom insists she can handle everything but her mental health is also being strained and she's concentrating on my sisters; she says she'll worry about her own mental health later. I've been telling her that everything is fine, I'm having a great time, and it's just little things that bother me now and then. I'm definitely not suicidal, but I don't really want to be alive anymore; there are too many things to be stressed about and I can't get rid of them. I don't enjoy anything anymore and I'm completely indifferent to everything. Being alive is just very unappetizing. I can't think of anything that would cause me to feel happy. Constantly sick to my stomach, have to force myself to eat properly. All I think about is what could go wrong and have this constant sense of impending doom, like something's about to go wrong but I can't see the trap I just know it's there. I throw up a lot of mornings (as soon as I wake up, nothing comes up) and sometimes once more at night. I'm going to mess everything up but nothing even happened yet. I used to think this was normal transition from college to adult life stress and everyone gets like this but apparently that is not the case. But I'm not going to tell my mom the one kid she thought was fine and didn't need to worry about is actually also going off the rails.

  
There isn't anything wrong though. I'm spending my senior year of college studying abroad and traveling, I have money set aside specifically for the year abroad. I have a professional certification I need to pass but I have time to study. The worst thing that happens is rain on a trip that was specifically because it's supposed to be sunny there. But it rains as soon as I arrive and gets sunny the day after I leave; everything to see and do was outside so it was really hard to enjoy in the rain. This happened the last 2 trips in a row and makes it feel like a big waste of money. Even when a trip goes well, I'm miserable all the time. If I don't enjoy myself, isn't it a waste of money? But if I don't go and travel I'm literally throwing away a huge opportunity I won't get back. I started to hate myself as a person, hate my face and hate looking in mirrors and hate my personality. I look at my sisters and what they go to therapy for and then I just feel pissed that I can't get my shit together. It's not even anything big, just a little rain here, worry about the exam or how much I'm spending there, stressed about planning a trip and what is something goes wrong and the transportation to get there is all piling up and it's not even a big problem. Nothing bad even happened yet but it keeps me up feeling sick all night. I don't know wtf is happening or why now of all times. Therapy seems excessive since there's nothing wrong but something is also not right. What am I supposed to do? I don't understand what is wrong. It didn't used to be like this. I just want to sleep and not ever have to wake up. What should I do? I cannot tell my parents as they are both already past max capacity; adding to their problems is not an option. For a long time, I was sure it would fix itself if I ignored it hard enough, and sometimes I do have ""good days"" where I think it's over before I tank again, but overall I think it's getting worse.

Ok_Holiday3814,"Needing support, at breaking point ",3,1bbu3sx,14,"Background: In my 40s.  A dozen years of major health issues throughout my adult life: mom had emergency brain surgery & stroke, dad had emergency brain surgery a year later, following year mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, then mom diagnosed with ovarian cancer, from which she passed away three years later.  Watching her go through chemo was brutal.

I have no family of my own, and only relative in the country is my dad.  He’s pushing 80, lives two hours away, and I take care of all his stuff - bills, taxes, etc.  

I live downtown, which in the past worked with my work.  Now in a senior management role where it really isn’t an option to not be putting in 12-14 hour days.  I’m salaried, so not paid overtime.  Due to work, I’ve given up on my hobbies - mostly hiking, skiing, etc., for day trips with friends an hour’s drive away.  That was my life for almost 20 years.  I’m constantly exhausted, so just don’t have it in me anymore.

Real estate has gone crazy.  For the last 20 years I worked hard, only took 3 big vacations, and saved whatever I could to be able to move back to my my hometown (Canmore).  Home prices have gone up 30%, so purchasing power is way less now.  I feel miserable in the city, trapped, exhausted, like I have nothing more in me to give.  Yet the only way I could ever see getting a home (I’m in a small condo now) is by working more.  Coworkers all have families, second homes, etc.  It hurts.  I’ve worked my entire adult working life towards this goal, but now it’s out of reach.  

In the last 6 years I had what felt like two breakdowns, the pressure was just too much.  I took most of a year off to reset, then it took me four months to get this job (interviews dragged out) so job situation makes it hard to find something else that truly would offer more work-life balance (as this place had promised,
was to be on 4-day workweek).  I really don’t know how long I can keep going like this.  I’m on the brink of collapse.   I wake up, go to work, come home after 10pm (from work), deal with things for my dad, sleep, and repeat. I’ve given up cooking because I’m too exhausted.  Poor food choices.  Developed back pain from all the sitting, eyes needing new prescription every three months from all the screen time.  I’m lucky to get 2,000-3,000 steps in in a day whereas I used to always be over 10,000.

What is the point?  Why do we do this to ourselves? I have a great therapist, but after years, it still doesn’t resolve the day-to-day challenges for which there are no options (i.e., need to work or I’d be screwed ever being able to retire).  We also have BRCA1 genetic mutation in my family, so like 90% of the women in my family passed away in their early 50s.  I’m not a carrier, but due to years of immense stress was diagnosed with premature menopause at age 36 after a cancer scare.

Hello, I just made this account. I currently have no one to vent to and this is a last resort because call lines are useless. Please feel free to scroll if this is a waste of your time. It is a really dumb thing to stress over.

I have ADHD, anxiety, social anxiety, and depression. I am a self-conscious person in my early twenties.
I quit a certain green therapy app last fall after almost a year of call sessions because I felt that it wasn’t helping.

Now, I am slowly spiraling again and I just need to vent.
I work at a place that involves customer service. I visited an institution to read to children. It was only my second event but I was anxious and tried to be friendly. The first one went okay because I ran into someone I was familiar with, but I knew no one in the second event.

That day was just not a good day and I think I felt it in my bones.
I was sitting with other visitors and was already feeling self-conscious because I had to shimmy out of the cafeteria bench in a long limited dress twice. I decided to ask the person in charge a question.
It was not my intention to be rude but this faux pas was the tipping point of my mental state this week.

I called her, “Excuse me, Ms?” She didn't respond and was staring down at her clipboard. My embarrassment increased and I don’t know why, but I tried one more time. She was two feet from me.
She was moving her lips as if reading and now I was sure she heard me. I became mortified as I realized that maybe she thought I was being rude. 
So, I did what I should’ve done in the first place and I extracted myself from the cafeteria bench and stood in front of her.
“Sorry, excuse me?”

After that, any emotional preparation for this day went out the window. I was a terrible and rude person and now I didn’t know how to function. This wasn’t even the beginning of the awkwardness of that day because my embarrassment had increased since the moment I had to ask the security guard to use the bathroom. I thought someone was in there and looked dumb because it was a bathroom with stalls inside (I seriously thought I heard someone say, “busy”).

At this point, I just didn’t want to start any more awkward interactions. My name is hard to pronounce and the event planners were now a few yards away from me (further away from the first one I tried to talk to).
I decided to throw away some trash quickly before they called me to not keep them waiting. However, that was a mistake because one of the visitors looked at me in the corner of their eye. They also realized that I was needed. I noticed the event planner from before was not calling me. It’s like she didn’t want to acknowledge me at all now. Once again, I looked rude.
When I was processing this, they called my last name and I responded.

I tried to move on. I know I made so many mistakes. In an effort to be polite, I looked passive-aggressive and rude. I know that I didn’t even recount my story properly but I need to vent.

I usually speak to a family member about my embarrassing moments, but she declined to preserve her own mental health ( we have similar issues and agreed on boundaries).
Another family member always makes my mental health issues about God and another always has to play devil’s advocate. I’m not expecting to be coddled but it’s still off-putting

I took .25 klonopin nightly from 2002 - 2023 not sure it did much but took it out of desperation. In 2016 had a bad spell and discovered Remeron. I never made it to therapeutic dose but have been taking 3.75mg for sleep and appetite.  The past year been really struggling again. I tried(again)1.25 Lex for a week then 2.5 Lex for 2 weeks but fatigue and anxiety worsened so had to stop.  This is 2nd time trailing Lex; had similar experiences with Zoloft and Prozac years ago. I feel like SSRIs don’t work for me.  I then tried Bupropion for 3rd time  75 mg for 18 days; I luckily did get honeymoon for about 10 days and thought I find a cure. However, it quickly turned and I started dry heaving and having massive anxiety so I had to stop.  It’s been a little over a month with nothing but 3.5 Remeron and I need relief.  Debating trying Lex again since it has lower side effect profile or Wellbutrin. Don’t really want Zoloft since it causes nausea and I refuse to try SNRI my anxiety want let me go down that road.  Below is my psychiatrist write up from 2016.  Thoughts?

b. The biggest problem here seems to be poor tolerability of medications that could really be of benefit. Anxiety may be playing a role. As such, alternative tactics may need to be employed ni order to optimize his chances of achieving a beneficial dose of medication. One approach would be ot use liquid, transdermal or orally soluble forms of antidepressant medication, along with low dose Klonopin as a bridge and as a means of combatting treatment-emergent anxiety during upward dose titrations. With this in mind, recommend considering the following:
c. Begin by retrialing an SSRI ni liquid form (such as sertraline), starting at very low dose (e.g., 6.25 mg) daily, with stead dose increases ni small (6.25-12.5 mg) increments as tolerated. Poor tolerability of these doses would perhaps implicate anxiety rather than direct side-effects. This can be minimized by using Klonopin 0.25 mg BID scheduled (rather than PRN). Breakthrough symptoms ni between doses could prompt use of Klonopin as a TDI (rather than BID) drug. A partial antidepressive response to sertraline can prompt dose increases as tolerated. fI antidperessive response remains partial and the sertraline (or alternative SSRI) dose cannot be increased for any
reason, then sertraline can be augmented with serial trials of bupropion (if depressed mood, low energy and concentration deficits are predominant), buspirone (if both generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms are predominant), or selected atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine, aripiprazole, or olanzapine).
d. fI step 3c is unsuccessful, can taper and stop sertraline (or alternative SSRI) and reintroduce mirtazapine 7.5 mg, using the SolTab formulation. From there, the dose can be carefully up-titrated ot 15 mg QHS. Would anticipate soporific effects at this dose. Partial antidepressive repsonse can be managed with dose increases, as tolerated. However, fi this is not possible or fi over-sedation complicates mirtazapie therapy, can reintroduce bupropion SR 100 mg AM, increasing to 100 mg BID after 7-8 days as tolerated.
e. If step 3d is unsuccessful, can undergo a therapeutic trial of vortioxetine, which is mechanistically different enough from other serotonergic antidepessants, though its profile for treating refractory depression is unproven.
f. If step 3e is unsuccessful, it would probably be worth undergoing another therapeutic trial of tertiary amine TCA, following baseline ECG to rule out QTc prolongation. Imipramine can be started at 50 mg/day as single dose at bedtime, and increased by 25-50 mg Q 7 days until 125-1500 mg/day si reached. This si a conservative titration strategy, given uncertainties in how this drug will be metabolized given pharmacogenetic profile. fI response occurs, patients will show significant clinical improvement in anxiety, physical expression of distress, concentration, and depressed mood within the first week on this dose. fI these symptoms do not improve and there are no medical contraindications or manifestations of toxicity, increase dose at rage of 25 mg Q7, days to maximum dose of 300 mg/day or until the patient begins to show improvement or experiences intolerable
adverse effects. Typically, 10-20 days of treatment at a target dose are needed before improvements in mood and affect become apparent (improvement usually is first apparent to others before it is to the patient). Partial responses can be managed by optimizing the dose within its therapeutic range. fI this is insufficient, can augment with lithium (600-900 mg/d, level of 0.6-1.0 mEq/L; wel tolerated when titrated slowly from 150 mg) or liothyronine (start at 25 mcg/d and increase to 50 mcg/d if no side effects are reported; contraindicated in
patients with recent MI, thyrotoxicosis, or adrenal insufficiency).
g. fI a therapeutic trial of tertiary amine TCA si ineffective, the medicine can be slowly tapered, followed by an appropriate washout period in preparation for a therapeutic trial of oral MAOl. The taper and washout period will last several weeks, and can be an opportune time to provide psychoeducation regarding the MAOl diet and avoidance of interacting drugs. Consultation with the hospital or clinic pharmacist can be helpful here. This time period would also provide ample opportunity to rehearse compliance with the MAOl diet.

h.
Following appropriate washout of prior antidepressant (and any potentially interacting drugs), tranylcypromine can be started at 10 mg twice a day, increased by 10-20 mg per week, until a target dose of 40-60 mg/day is reached. If phenelzine si preferred, ti can be started at 15 mg BID-TID, with a target dose of 45-90 mg/day. Poor
gastrointestinal tolerance of either may be treatment-limiting. Should this occur, can consider selegiline (EMSAM), starting with the 6 mg patch and increasing the dose as required to 9 or 12 mg/d. With EMSAM, the MAOl diet
and avoidance of interacting drugs should still be practiced. Partial responses to MAOls can be managed by dose optimization, or by augmentation with lithium, thyroid hormone, or atypical antipsychotics.

&#x200B;

I have severe anxiety and OCD. I am 23 in grad school. I have no family history of mental illness besides OCD.

I was recently diagnosed with OCD but I have had the tendencies my entire life and this bad high really brought it out and was even hospitalized for it in the past due to the extreme anxiety (unrelated to this story).

So, this happened about 3 months ago right after finals I wanted to relax so I got high, I had to pass drug tests for my co-op, so my tolerance was very low, and I took more than I normally do and I was also high alone in my college apartment which is never the case.

I was playing COD with my buddies online. I took way too much edible (120 mg) and this made me very anxious and also took 200 mg of caffeine of reign. So, then I thought I heard something, and I ripped my headphones off, and it sounded like my neighbors/someone in the hallway, but I was so high that it made it sound like it was in my apartment.

This made me super anxious, because I thought what I was hearing was not real (but in hindight it probably was). Then my friends got off and I stayed on because I was super anxious that I would hear something and I wanted them to stay on because I thought I was going to hallucinate and hear something not real when I took my headphones off. Then when I eventually did take my headphones off I was so tired and anxious.

This led to me hearing what sounded like intelligible conversation(I also had a ton of white noise in my room) and this made me freak out into a panic attack, because I thought I was in psychosis. I had no delusions, messages, or anything from what I thought I heard.  My tinnitus was so bad (always is when I am high) that I couldn't tell where I was coming from but it sounded like white noise in my apartment. I went to sleep and felt completely normal the next day until I googled schizophrenia symptoms and now, I am very anxious about getting it.


This has made grad school near impossible this semester and I am struggling under the stress of school and this stupid crap I should have never done.

Sorry, that is a lot, but I do not think like that anymore. Do I have any reasons to be concerned at all?? Is this normal? I am sorry, I just wish I never got high, and I am scared I screwed up my mind and my career. Yes, I am **NOT** getting high EVER again.

**Once again, my pcp, psych, and 2 therapists** are **NOT concerned but I am**. This anxiety has been extreme because I am so scared of schizophrenia.

**My psych said this:**

He was extremely confident that I didn’t experience psychosis and that my anxiety was making me hear stuff because I was anxious about hearing stuff.

He said audio distortions can happen with extreme anxiety and combine that with the psychoactive ingredients in thc it caused me to freak out.  

He also said in 25 years hes been a psychiatrist he has seen psychosis and people with “nondecript” symptoms that I have experienced.  He said he has never had someone develop a psychotic disorder with nondescript symptoms that I had experienced.

Now when I am **sober** and obsessed with psychosis my brain kind of makes (nothing clear or delusions or voices giving commands or legible) conversations/music in white noise and my **tinnitus** makes it worse.  This only happens when I am anxious and scared.",1710115770.0,
cherryblossomtulip,The worst anxiety of my life,1,1bbkazt,0,"Hello 🌸
Im (age 22) desperately looking for help from everyone who suffered/suffers from anxiety or a panic disorder. 

My story in short form is that i had panic attacks since i was 10, in moments where i felt trapped and couldnt leave the place easily (classrooms, crowds of people, train drives …)
With therapy i could handle it and became a nurse to help other people with this problem. 
June 2023 something changed. I drove the train home and suddenly had the worst panic attack of my life. I had so many panic attacks and never experienced this type of fear before. 
Since this day i was never calm or relaxed. 
For weeks i couldnt leave my house, but even in my safe space i have unimaginable fear. 
I‘ve tried different antidepressants, right now im taking 100mg Sertraline/Zoloft, my mood is better but the fear is the same. 

Im in therapy but it is not helping, because i cant even explain what im afraid about. Im scared of everything, its like my brain is permanently ready to fight something and i cant turn it off or calm me down. At the same time i have the worst derealization feelings. 
It has almost been a year since i last felt safe and im scared its gonna be like this forever. 

I started to think if it was a physical reaction? 
Because why did it happen so suddenly and why am i not able to control it, even though i have so much willpower. 
I always had an iron deficiency, but the last time i got it checked it was just slightly low.
Could it still be that? 

Sometimes its calming to read similar stories, especially if they have a happy ending 🥹

If anyone has a tip i would be so grateful.
I want to live again. 

I hope you are well 🌸

I have been dealing with something I know is common, but want some tips/feedback. I’m 51 and have been a high school teacher for 23 years and have always LOOOOVED it…always considered one of the best civics teachers in my county, even state. However. Last September, my dad died at 70 of cancer that he had been diagnosed with only a few months before. I lived with him and had a great relationship etc, and was the one who did everything for him. Grief is a mothertrucker. I lost my mom 20 yrs ago, that was VERY sudden and REALLY SUCKED because we were very close…so I am chock full of the grief coping mechanisms and all that jazz. 
After he died, I just stopped feeling like being at work. Literally. Stopped feeling like going. I loved my students, loved my co workers - there was so much support. I could never pinpoint WHY. I have been on meds (Wellbutrin and Lamical, Xanax when needed) since I was 21, but absolutely nothing made me feel like doing a damn thing. I switched schools to get a fresh reset. But the same thing has been happening this year to the point of embarassment, but with the added bonus of getting anxiety about lesson planning. I burned through my leave, and get leave without pay whenever I am out. Even THAT hasn’t made me get it together. I’m having that fun paralysis with most everything. I love crafty stuff. I have wanted to get a second Master’s or go to law school or even take a friggin Spanish class (I love school). Nope, anxiety attack even considering doing anything like that. I cannot pull it together to clean up my house and can stand in the living room staring at everything simply thinking for like a half an hour of how bad I need to clean etc. 
When I actually go to work, I love my kids, love my co workers, love my subject. But I have taught basically NOTHING because of that odd anxiety attack thing about lesson planning. I am a VERY popular teacher and have been open and honest with my students about these struggles. I don’t necessarily want to be out of the classroom.
But dammit! What the heck? I added Lexapro to the cocktail and that was a bad move. So, I switched to adding Pristiq last week. Hoping that will help pull me up.

How to be better than as I was very competative how to be a genius like Albert Einstein how to be prefect like Leonardo da vinci and many more.

breadjupiter,I need help. I've been postponing washing my dishes for two weeks now and now it's overwhelming ,12,1b8at86,17,"I'm getting better and slowly getting back to things. But I'm out of dishes and honestly just can't seem to wash the dirty ones. I've put new water into and occasionally cleaned some out when I needed them. But the whole pile is overwhelming and idk what to do

This happened 2 months ago as well. Then I really felt guilty and decided to clean the dishes right after I eat/cook. Then I built that habit but along came the anxiety of super quickly finishing the meal so I can quickly wash the dish finally. Idk, that was also a little stressful, in a different way tho. 

I'm thinking maybe I should keep just one of each cutlery to keep things minimal in the future. Then I'll wash it right way. 

Any tips? Words of support? Would appreciate it, thank you. 

Edit: writing this after 4 days. I FINALLY FUCKING DID IT!!! I bought a new sponge, put on some gloves, and listened to a random podcast and slowly did them all even though I still had no motivation to clean them. I guess, with depression and anxiety, I'll try to make it a habit of doing things even tho I'm not feeling motivated enough instead of waiting around for when ""the mood finally hits me"".

I have a great life and am extremely blessed to have all that I do. Some backstory: I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 11 and put on meds. I’ve always struggled with anxiety and depression, pretty bad at times, but have always gotten by and usually I felt better by the next day. The last year or two, but especially lately, I’ve felt like I’m going crazy. My anxiety and depression are constantly at an all time high, and I feel like I’m having a giant panic attack from the moment I wake up. My depression has also been way worse than ever before, and I don’t know how to cope with everything. I’ve been at my job now about six months and feel like such an idiot and annoyance every day. People aren’t mean to me, but no one really likes me much or goes out of their way to talk to me. I don’t blame them, though- I’m extremely awkward and quiet at work. I feel so dumb and I’m not confident enough in myself or my skills/work to talk to people, as they’re all more experienced. I feel completely in over my head. I’n taking insurance classes through the company and can’t seem to retain any info and have failed two exams. I’m petrified to tell my job. Besides work, I talk to my parents often. I always call first, and lately I can feel that I’m annoying them. I feel like they try to get off the phone pretty quick, which hurts. I have three older siblings, who I also typically reach out to first. Or, they reach out when they need a favor. I don’t know how to explain it, but I just feel like such a burden and inconvenience to everyone I interact with. I used to be so confident, and now I isolate and stay quiet because I hate myself. I have to be such a disappointment to my friends and family. I feel so guilty staying around when I’m just sad and anxious and cause more stress than joy. I’ve spent so long now researching all the different ways I could end things, and I’ve written so many goodbye letters. I’ve looked myself dead in the eye in the mirror and swore to myself that I’d end things- for myself, and for those around me. It really feels best, long-term. I’m terrified of the pain, of failing, and of disappointing people more than I already have. I thought about overdosing on beta blockers and antidepressants, but apparently it’s pretty rare to actually OD. Every time I’m driving alone, I think about driving off a bridge or under a semi. But apparently, that’s not usually that successful, either. And it’s all so selfish- I can’t stand to think about the person/people who would have to find my body, deal with possible trauma, etc. I don’t know… the idea of continuing to live this way scares me more than the opposite. I feel past the point of burnt out, and bo amount of sleep gives me energy. Am I going crazy? Can anyone relate to what I’m saying/how I’m feeling?

What does inspiring movie scenes, songs that move us or just human interaction with loved ones all have in common? They activate this powerful blissful energy inside of us that is commonly known as Frisson, Euphoria, Prana, Qi and can be most easily felt within us when we experience chills/goosebumps from positive events/stimuli.  


  
This soothing energy can be learned to be activated as you please without any outside stimuli, just the simple intention of experiencing it. So imagine how helpful it can be when faced with unwanted stress/anxiety. You can even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration.  


  
This has been documented, many years ago, in the eastern part of the world as they discovered that it can be made to flow through the body via channels coined as Meridians or Nadis that encompass the entire human body.  


  
It has been researched and documented under many names like Bioelectricity, Life force, Prana, Chi, Qi, Orgone, Rapture, Tension, Aura, Euphoria, Ecstasy, Mana, Vayus, ASMR, Nen, Intent, Tummo, Odic force, Kriyas, Pitī, Frisson, Ruah, Spiritual Energy, Secret Fire, The Tingles, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Aether, Chills, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.   


  
Why is this important? Too many sources point us to outside substances to manage stress, as if the human body wasn't designed to be able to rely on itself for its own internal problems.  


  
Now for some of you that say that stress is good should consider that there are two types of stress and oxidative stress has been linked to several neurological diseases (i.e., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis, depression, and memory loss).

Fading-Hope,What went wrong in my last job?,0,1b3cpc8,4,"I'm gonna tell my story of what happened in my last job and hopefully you guys tell me what I can improve on.

I got hired at this very low end job. Everyday i start by greeting literally everyone at work, even people who i don't know, always had this big fake smile because at work you have to greet every customer and coworker like that (so I thought) But the thing is obviously I'm extremely awkward, shy, introverted and have crippling social anxiety, depression, adhd etc everything to a 1000. And most people can tell that immediately. In work some ppl are genuine and are nice back, some ppl have this ""not this loser again, this is too early in the morning"" look and some give out a quiet sigh.

So this is my 1st mistake, I come off as too desperate, not everyone is an npc and not everyone is obligated to be nice.

Like I mentioned before i have everything on a 1000 and that hinders my work performance, socializing and everything i do, sometimes i pretty much freeze and are left on people's mercy, and some bad apples will try to take advantage of me, some people give out this vibe like ""If this loser can make money working here, than I can hire my own friends and family too"" and try to get my fired. 


2nd mistake, I'm just not assertive or confident enough. And with my lack of experience i come off as being too afraid to make a mistake despite being just as qualified as them.


It's a very low end job so I'm the only white guy there. Most coworkers there are REALLY NICE to you for the first few days because they don't know if you might be someone's friend or maybe you're the boss's nepo hire, but once you come out as an outcast introvert who likes sitting alone at the dinner table to avoid socializing you will get very different looks. 

The type of coworkers there. Old coworkers are usually okay there cuz they've seen it all before. White women have this nonchalant attitude, like they don't care what happens. Black, arab and eatern european guys are hard working and helpful but they will **roast** tf out of you, they aren't that bad, most of my time there was working with them. Black women are usually the most tense to me for some reason, they come off as very moody and desperate, and would blame me first if anything were to go wrong. Latino guys are some of the nicest always. The one asian dude and chick there were okay, but I always felt that Asian ppl get the ick super easily, they always pick up on the awkward cues. Arab and Latino women feels like they try to be extra nice to you cuz they pity you. The one or two fellow socially awkward anxious ppl there made me feel bad.

Then basically I got fired there cuz a blk wm coworker outed me cuz she didn't wanna work the holidays with a rookie, despite telling me she has years of experience herself she wanted to be with someone who would do most of the work so she can chill. I got super depressed hearing all this being said to my face infront of everyone. I'm a **substitute** and dont work there permanently, so only when someone is sick i could come in, I didn't wanna work for a couple of days after feeling depressed, and they fired me after.

3rd mistake ???


My takeaway is you have to earn people's respect and trust by being very competent, dependable and patient, all traits i gotta work on. And despite what some people might say, It's not a just front because I'm awkward or have anxiety I'm genuinely a nice guy and i try to be friendly and nice to everyone all the time, it's just good experience to have for next time.",1709243928.0,

I am looking for some help on how to start and work on homework, homework is a extremely hard task for me and I’ve asked and told multiple irl people about how homework is effecting my life and they continue to give the same advice making me extremely frustrated because most of the advice is coming from people who do not understand what it is like to have depression (I do not mean this in a rude way I apologize if it does sound rude) 

For me the reason why homework is so hard to do is because I’ve spent multiple long hours on homework, I’m a slow worker, some of my usual times for homework is up to 4 hours making my life living hell.

So because of that I don’t want to even try homework anymore, I’ve used to lie more to my parents at the beginning of the year about homework so I wouldn’t get in trouble and then do it at 5 in the morning instead. I’ve been trying my best to fix this I know it is not a good way to deal with homework but the anxiety of what they will say and do and the stress of wasting time on insignificant assignments makes my life stressful.

I want to go get an alternative teaching certification in grades 6-12 math or science (haven’t decided which subject yet).

My parents lectured me saying that I need to get it together and that I’ve become so complacent with this terrible job and they won’t support me once I’m 26.

ProseccoSorbet,Crazy side effects??,1,1b1pell,0,"Over the past 8 years, I’ve searched for a medication that works well to combat my anxiety and depression symptoms. About 2 years ago, my doctor and I finally settled on Viibryd, due to it having little to no side effects on my body / mental health compared to the many other medications I’ve tried. 

I finally feel like something is working for me and my way of life has improved exponentially! 

Except…well…one thing… MY REFLEXES!!!

I get spooked, and I mean SPOOKED when everyday events happen. Here’s a few examples: 
1. If someone comes around the corner and I don’t hear them, I jump about 10 FEET in the air! 
2. If someone opens the bathroom door to come in while I am opening the door on the other side to go out, I jump and GASP so loud, it scares the other person
3. If I see a small car accident, I panic and my heart RACES as if I’m involved in the accident. I feel like I might pass out. 
4. I see a roach, I’m SCREAMING. 
5. I see a shadow, I JUMP in a panic.

My heart is always racing over these seemingly small events. 

I have never been easily spooked. I’m in my mid-20s. I’m relatively healthy. I’ve never been in an accident (knock on wood) and I’ve never been attacked by anything so idk why I’m so jumpy… 

Is it just me? Is anybody out there? 

EDIT: One of the side effects of Viibryd is Serotonin Syndrome. After some research, I found that many of the symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome are related to reflexes. One of these symptoms includes Hyperreflexia, which is an overactive or overresponsive bodily reflexes. Usually that has more to do with twitching but I feel like my overreactions fall somewhat under this category?  ",1709073554.0,

veryberryblue,Wierd morning anxiety. Anyone else?,6,1b0rfh4,7,"I lay down and sleep normally until about 4-5 in the morning when I start getting these very random and intrusive thoughts and memories and with each one, I have a little anxiety attack until I'm finally a full-blown nervous wreck.

I have made myself sick with worry about a stupid nuclear apocalypse and I do it to myself out of curiosity and a needing to know what'll happen IF it ever happens.  I'm worried that if Trump comes into office again it'll happen and I'm so scared to die. I don't want anyone I know to die. I don't want dying to hurt for myself or anyone and I think that may be what I'm most concerned about. I just want everything to remain the same and not get worse. If anything I want things to get better and it feels like that's not going to happen. I'm also worried that maybe Joe is right and things will only get worse if Biden (or whoever isn't Trump) is elected. I don't know what to do. I'm woefully underprepared if a crisis were to ever happen but if I prepare for it it'll just make me feel worse and worry more. AND not only that but we have climate change and natural disasters to worry about. So naturally I'm a mess. No one seems to understand how I feel. They just tell me everything is going to be fine and to not worry when they don't seem to understand how horribly wrong things can go.

3emo5you,I feel like I won’t be able to handle a job,1,1b0k4x2,3,"Exactly what it says. I just graduated with an honestly kind of useless art degree and I’m struggling with what to do now. I try to picture myself working a regular job like retail, food service, office, but I start to panic at the thought of having to socialize and deal with other people, whether they be coworkers or customers. 

I have a lot of anxiety about pretty much everything, especially anything social. I’m diagnosed with generalized/social anxiety, depression, and ocd with a potential for others as well, but I stopped therapy before taking about those more. I live at home and my mother has been trying to help me, but it always boils down to “just go do it”. I’ve tried explaining to her that I can’t, and that her nonstop insistence is only making it more difficult (likely pathological demand avoidance, undiagnosed), so she stopped for two-five days (I have poor time awareness so I’m not sure how long exactly) before coming back to me saying that she waited long enough. 

This has been a bit of a recurring theme through my journey of dealing with my mental illness and finding out who I actually am and the boundaries I am comfortable with. She will give a sympathetic “speech” about how she understands what I am going through, but they always end with “just go do the thing, you’ll be fine”. Not helpful. I know I could theoretically do the thing, but that doesn’t stop the panic and anxiety I get from just thinking about it. 

I understand that I am a burden to my parents, living off of them while contributing very little, but I also feel very trapped in this situation. I feel that they have not given me the mental and emotional tools necessary for life. I actively try to supplement them, but the fear and hopelessness have already taken over in their place. Being aware of this does not change the situation or my ability to alter it. 

I feel that I should also mention some chronic health issues that I’ve been dealing with for several years, most symptoms for my whole life, that have yet to be successfully diagnosed. The most relevant being extreme fatigue no matter the sleep circumstances, and joint pains that can happen at any time for any reason, or no reason at all. 

I feel like I have no skills to do anything. I have precious little experience, and too many things that I cannot do either physically or mentally that no employer would want to deal with. The thought of applying is terrifying. The thought of replying to emails it terrifying. The thought of interviews is terrifying. The thought of messing up is terrifying. The thought of going there, making connections with new people, and having to learn about and socialize with them is terrifying. The thought of dealing with taxes is terrifying. The thought of getting a workers permit is terrifying. Most of the time, the thought of leaving my house is terrifying. 

I would like to sell my yarn work and other crafts but that brings a whole new set of challenges. I get to do something I love but it won’t exactly bring in enough to live off of especially at the start. I could sell prints of my art but that requires quality, possibly professional, photography, as well as a website and store, a company to print them, and advertising. I could sell my art pieces themselves, but that would require giving up my precious works that I have spent dozens to hundreds of hours on. 

It all feels like too much no matter which way I look. I feel stuck and like nothing is designed to work for me and people like me. That feels very solipsistic to say, but it’s true, at least to an extent. I’m sorry this is so long, but nothing feels okay and I just need help. ",1708961112.0,
Mission-Initiative22,I'm sick of it and need a change.,6,1b06mem,2,"I  don't explicitly  say I want to kill myself in this post. Just that i hate my life or have the feeling I'd rather be dead.

&#x200B;

I've struggled to manage both a job and my personal life for close to a decade now. I have just come to that conclusion. I wake up in the morning and think I'd d rather be dead. And yes a lot of the time I get through the day and I'm relieved and I think, okay maybe I overreacted. But no, i feel this pretty persistently that, I'd rather not live this life, and I'd rather not feel the way I feel every day.As of last week I got a notice from my landlord. They did an inspection nwhxuh I'm certain I didn't receive 24 hr notice for (I think they may have put it in someon else's mailbox who then put it in mine the day of becuase I was checking my mail and I didn't see until I got home from work the day of the inspection). From Sept to Dec of last year I cleaned my apartment less and less and less til I was eventually not cleaning at all, or minimally so as to keep things just barely functional. 

Anyway I had started cleaning but at the time they did the inspection I was only about 1/4 way on progress and they served me a notice to say they would seek legal action if I didn't get it clean by next Tuesday.I can do it. And I'm going to try my best. If I'm being honest I don't think it was as bad as it looked. It actually got messier as I was cleaning because I was making piles and took all my spoiled food out of the refrigerator.

This is the lowest of lows on top of being close to being diabetic now and becoming overweight.

What bothers me is that I've been seeing a psychotherapist for a year and a half now and yes, some things improved. But yet I sunk into this funk anyway, and I can't figure out how I could say to my therapist for four months that I haven't been cleaning and I don't like it but I don't feel anything about it and she not flag thst as some kind of mental health crisis.Idk she just keeps trying to ""therapy"" me into somehow not hating my life which is comprised of a 9 to 5 that depresses me (and I've hated every 9 to 5 eventually even if I liked it at first).  Or that  shouldn't feel like utter shit that I have 40,000 in debt instead of the 200,000 I could have saved. Well bravo. Now I know how to not have shame or beat myself up. I'm growing leaps and bounds I still feel like shit every morning.

I've done everything you're supposed to do. I've done all the diets and I've had those years where I worked out consistently but in all that there was always one thing, one trigger. My job. I was always doing all that or NOT doing all that so I could offset the way I felt.I'm also seeing a psychologist who thinks I have adhd. Okay so great. Maybe after spending thousands of dollars for this diagnosis, I get another pill to take.I feel like the problem is the 9 to 5. I have no problem working. I can work all day long. But I really wish i was doing something that didn't make me feel like I hate my life. YES it is anxiety but it's also that I find the job far too stressful for me.I've been trying over the years to develop other options for myself but I'm too exhausted and down to really maintain anything. But I know thst I quit my job in 2020. It was the happiest that I was, and I dropped 20lbs without trying.

To be clear, I'm a good worker. My superiors are encouraging me to become a supervisor and eventually get into management. I just honestly do not care. I don't believe I have to work a 9 to 5 to put eat, and have somewhere to put my head. But I feel stuck.

The point of this post though is to say that I'm sick of constantly feeling I'm being largely ignored or minimized saying these things to medical professionals. Either being given pills or that i should get more sleep or being given tips to avoid spiralling. Well i DIDNT spiral for four months. But i also just stopped feeling anything or caring about anything.I think I should have been on disability a long time ago but it's like it's normal to everyone to be miserable.

 Now things are worse at my job where I'm doing my own work and training others as well as reviewing and approving their work. And I'm working long hoursI think the 9 to 5 is harming a lot of people and I just think society thinks pills are the answer to everything. I tell my NP that I'm working with to lose weight and just prescribes me Contrave. Okay so I'll just take this potentially damaging medication the rest of my life JUST so I can not placate myself with food,   work this job and keep my life in order, when I would do it just fine if I wasn't stuck professionally.

No one has the answers for me. If I want to leave my job, no one can tell me how to do that or what to do. I get that. But I just wish someone could say ""you appear to have difficulty working and managing your life"" and ""maybe you might want to consider career alternatives"".

Then, I changed schools in my 7th grade, and in the new school, I was really nervous .. and I didn't participate in any thing nor played sports.

Crazy_Job_2615,Is this anxiety? Perspectives and ideas gratefully received,6,1azno21,5,"Just a bit of context, I (36F) live with my partner (36m), daughter (11) and son (3 months). I’m struggling a bit at the moment, as I think everyone with a new baby does to some extent.

I’m fairly sure I have some anxiety, but it manifests itself most when I’m about to leave the house. I’m just not sure what to call this though, as I don’t think it’s social anxiety - I don’t try ink I worry about socialising. And I’m not afraid of being out of the house at all - I like going out. It’s the specific act of leaving the house that has me anxious. Sometimes I’m afraid to be late, but even when we are going for a walk or something that I can’t really be late for, I get anxious and stressed at rounding everyone up to leave and I usually upset my family. I am aware of this, but even when I try to conceal my stress, it is still very obvious to my family!
I’m trying to understand exactly what makes me anxious in this situation, but struggling to identify the issue.

Something I have thought of is that my dad, who I’m also fairly sure has anxiety, used to get pretty anxious (from what I remember) about leaving the house. He would never want to be late and I think that when I was a child, perhaps leaving the house was quite stressful. Though I don’t recall being particularly upset by it as a child.I’m not trying to blame him, I guess just wondering if that could have contributed. 
I feel horrible that I’m doing the same and upsetting my children. I desperately want to stop and understand what is wrong, but I’m so confused by it.
I think I also have other areas of anxiety, and worry quite a lot about upsetting my family, annoying them in the process.

UnluckyGas1439,"24/7 lightheadedness, vision/balance problems. Could this all be anxiety?! ",1,1ayh2ur,0,"Hi, I’m a 28 yo m here. For a little over a decade I’ve suffered from minor anxiety. My anxiety has always been manageable for me and it’s never required me to be on any sort of medication for it. I’m a former alcohol drinker and nicotine user and would consider myself moderate users of both leaning heavier on the cigarette/vape side of things. That all stopped for me at the beginning of last year though. 

I discovered a small growth/bump on my back which caused some concern for me. Fearing the worst I went to my doctor who loosely diagnosed it as a lipoma. He recommended me see a specialist, unfortunately for me I wouldn’t see him for a couple months due to scheduling. During my time of not really knowing, I started to notice some psychical changes in my day to day. I’ve been a carpenter for 8 years and have always been an active person so I was very aware of slight changes in my psychical abilities. I first noticed a slight imbalance walking about the job site. This was accompanied by pressure in my left ear, almost a clogged feeling. I assumed a possible wax blockage throwing off my equilibrium. That ended up not being the case after I went to my doctor and he discovered my ear was clear of a blockage. In the following days at work I started to become lightheaded and my eyes became very sensitive to light.  I also started not being able to drink caffeine which I was very used to drinking on a daily basis. I found the caffeine to worsen the psychical symptoms I was having. At this point in time the  growth/bump is still worrying me as well as another stressor involving my girlfriend traveling solo for her work, which always made me slightly anxious. A little over two weeks of me noticing changes in my psychical ability I was not able to work entirely. When I say 24/7 lightheadedness, I mean all day EVERY DAY. My balance was off along with my vision being blurry making it very difficult to read text I normally wouldn’t have an issue with. Im no longer able to work largely due to the constant lightheadedness and general unsteadiness on my feet, which was obviously concerning. 

Fast forward a couple months and im still out of work with all these symptoms remaining the same. Around this time I also find out that bump I was worried about was just a small cyst that was of no concern at all. Great news……I thought that was really the trigger for all my psychical problems. Unfortunately that was not the case and here I am a year later dealing with the same issues. My anxiety surrounding my health has skyrocketed with the psychical symptoms staying around even after I was told my initial worry (the cyst) was nothing to worry about. I’ve gotten so much blood work done along with ekgs, mris and even seeing multiple specialists. Everything comes back normal. My life’s completely changed as I’m still out of work after almost a year of the onset of psychical symptoms. 

Could I be living in my head? Could this really be all stress and anxiety ruining my everyday life? I’ve tried SSRIs and SNRIs with no luck. Just started seeing a therapist as well. I’m going to start taking magnesium glycinate and vitamin b2 as they both come recommended from a neurologist. If this is indeed anxiety/stress that I’m unable to get control of, it sure is  crazy how it can affect your body! Let me know what you think!!!!  ",1708735663.0,
Born_Ad_3760,For those feeling helpless - there's hope,1,1ayemk5,0,"My story is one of miracles, redemption of life, and freedom.  I'm writing this post in hopes that I can help those of you who are struggling.

I'm a 40-year-old male with a history of cPTSD, Chronic Depression, Suicidality, Anxiety, addiction, and 6+ concussions.  For most of my life, I suffered. 

However, today I am free of all of these.  I'm sharing my story today in hopes it can help bring hope to those of you who are feeling lost, defeated, and desperate.

I've been engaged of some form of psychotherapy since I was 13.  While the traditional methodologies helped me calm the intensities of my emotions they fell short of liberating me from my distress.  

Everything in my life was impacted.  My ability to create and maintain healthy relationships was non-existent.  I sought alcohol and drugs to escape the torment I was in.  

I had never seen what a healthy relationship looked like. I didn't believe in love.  To me, love equated to pain and fighting.  

I felt alone and was constantly fighting for my sovereignty.

In my 33rd year, the tides started to shift.  Over the past 7 years, through blessing after blessing, I've been able to free myself.  

The transformation I've been through was predicated on learning, practices, and commitments.

Inspired by what I experienced I sought to reverse engineer what worked for me and formulate it into a system that could be shared and repeated.

Even though the past 4 years of my life have been extremely challenging and chalked full of traumatic experiences, I've not once fallen back into depression, suicidality, anxiety, or substance abuse. 

I'm so grateful for my freedom from the prison I was in.

Finally, I feel confident in my ability to navigate anything my life throws my way.  

Now I'd like to share with others the exact formula that completely resolved my mental health conditions. I'm wondering if anyone here feels like that would be helpful.

If there are enough of you who feel it would be valuable to your healing journey, I'd be open to creating the educational materials.  

Please let me know.  

In the meantime, bless all your lives.  I'm praying for all of you who are struggling.  Keep faith that it can and will get better with the right treatments.

veryberryblue,Hypnagogic hallucinations (auditory) at night. Anyone else experience these?,2,1ay4vwi,1,"I have really severe PTSD and anxiety from multiple traumas over the past 3-4 years. Stress, from what I understand, can cause Hypnagogic hallucinations and I have experienced them in the past but last night, they were pretty bad.

So, I woke up at about 4:30AM this morning and from that point on, every time I would start to drift off to sleep, I would hear a small dog yapping or someone knocking or something rubbing against the wall or a bird singing and various other sounds. With each new sound, I would wake up very anxious and in a panic and would try to go back to sleep again...only to be awakened by another sound just as I was falling asleep.

Immediate_Reward7595,15 was the worst age for me in my WHOLE LIFETIME ,3,1axwvi8,2,"Hey guys! Today I just wanna talk about this trash age for me in my whole lifetime. This year was sucks for me. It made my anxiety even grow and grow. Ok, so on my 15th birthday, it was quite normal, got a new PS5 game called Final Fantasy 14 which is a MMORPG where you can play with tons of players and the story is just insanely long but very funny and interesting. I entered High School a bit after my birthday and it was just a fine 1st Semester. Made some new friends and got along with the most of the teachers. My schoolmates were very kind, friendly, and also funny. We had a great time in the 1st semester but after this, someone’s reaction to a joke of mine turns into a living hell or even a dreadful curse. Ok, in my break in school, I was going to a cram school to do my homework but on break time there, I talked with one lady there and I couldn’t remember the joke but I remember it was surely not a hurtful or a bad joke but the lady reacted quite strange and she started getting angry at me and I was soo surprised and shocked. From that day on, the curse just kept on coming in my side, school even began quite strange where some of my classmates started avoiding me or acting strange around me, got into trouble everyday, I was even scolded from the school janitor because I was making an art project in class that only had like 2 hours and since, there was a lot of people in the room, I was very uncomfortable and anxious and couldn’t finish it so I had to finish my art assignment by being left in school late and the art teacher gave me the permission to stay school until I finish it but when I walked the hallway alone to get my shoes so I can go home quickly after the Art project is done, I encountered the school janitor and was yelled by staying late at school. There were other kids but he only yelled at me. Just turns out like this once I’m alone. I feel scared walking alone in school. I attend to a therapist house, it’s his house but at the middle of 10th grade, I started going there every Mondays and Wednesdays. You are able to talk to the counselor, he has his friends when he was a kid so there were like 65 - 70 years olds but I got along with everyone there too. His friends are also his classmates when he was little. There were even some university students attending there and we had a lot of fun at his house. My counselors house was huge and 1 of the rooms offers his costumers candies and cookies in a huge bowl so we ate a lot and talking at the same time. I talked with my counselor that people easily get on me and say ridiculous stuffs. I also got treated like a baby from some 16 years olds due to being one of the youngest in the class. The age 15 was a completely garbage for me! I’ll kill myself if I had to return to this idiotic age. I remember I was completely embarrassed walking in the streets with this age. The number is a lame, the year of this age is very stressful, lots of conflict with your parents. Just trash. GO TO HELL, 15 YEARS OLD! YOU’RE A CURSE! I was very happy on my 16th birthday that I was able to leave this lame age. I even learned a Japanese word where number 1 is “Ichi” and number 5 is “Go” and some Japanese kids calls the number 15 as “Ichigo” means strawberry.

I’m in my early 30s. I never had any idea of what I wanted to do as a career. I was a good student, and maybe I was naive but it never occurred to me that I’d have to pick a whole career. It was just go to college and you can do anything you want. Well when given the choice of everything, how do you choose one thing?


I didn’t think I was good enough to be a doctor, nurse, lawyer, accountant, teacher etc etc etc.  the idea of responsibility actually scared me. 


I’ve had a few jobs since I’ve graduated, but I feel like I worked so hard, and for what? Everyone I know my age is making 2x my salary, because they chose a career. I’ve never gotten any promotion, because I leave a job after a few years because I feel there’s nowhere higher I’m qualified to go. 


I work in healthcare administration now. So I thought maybe I’d get a degree in that? But then I thought, do I really like healthcare? What if I want to work somewhere else then my degree is useless. Maybe an MBA? But would I actually be able to commit to that and use it in some meaningful way? 


I just feel lost, like I’m starting from 0 every time I look for a new job because I don’t believe I have the experience or qualifications for a step up. I can’t afford to go back to school full time, and I wouldn’t even know what to go for. Money causes me a lot of anxiety so if I could make more I think I’d feel better about it?

RedMasker,"Yep, I ruined it.",3,1axfhdh,1,"Recently had an overwhelming day, which left me drained. Feeling like shit for days, to the point I could barely speak to my boyfriend and friends. It happens once a month, I thought I'll get over it again. But this time shit when south and didn't come back to normal.

My boyfriend was worried about me to the point of crying and at the time I wasn't in place to feel sympathetic or anything really, so i just plainly texted sorry and moved on. I was totally numb, and it scared me. After that I just felt like a shit partner. I've been thinking to sabotage everything, end it all. It's kinda like ""I already fucked up, what's the point to keep going?"".

 I can't find a job, after getting comfortable with people I have harder time opening up and expressing my feelings, people get overly attached to me for some reason and they almost immediately read that I'm moody or don't feel well and worry. I'm not sure I can live this life. Sure, I will survive, but after having new connections I understand I can't just work myself to death at a random job. It's either trying a little or running away, like I did in the past and roll with it, until I can't take it anymore.

Today I told my boyfriend I'm not coming over, not until I find a job, which basically means for a long time. I was really dry when messaging, despite feeling better, or rather neutral. He didn't answer after that. I'm pretty sure I made him cry again. 
Yesterday my friend told me she gained energy to call me and talk things over and help, because I was there for her in the past. I didn't want to pick up the phone nor could I, so I told her I will call later. I never did, when she tried to call I ignored her again. She texted me ""fine, I won't annoy you anymore."". 

They are insecure, they fear abandonment, they told me that. I'm not sure if I myself fear abandonment, but I'm not quite secure either. I know I hurt them, but I feel like they deserve better, so I hope they abandon me. I'm falling into this hole again. 

I don't want to search for a job - there's no point. I couldn't land anything for 2 months now and my mother just told someone over the phone ""he's sitting for 2 months now, I don't know what he's thinking, probably waits till he's offered a million dollar salary"". I guess all the attempts to find a job don't count, fuck me I guess. 

I never thought I was good for my boyfriend, even before dating, I wished to be with him, but wanted to push him away. I wish he'd meet someone better. I thought I was getting better. I hope they stay unconfronting and leave me for good. There's no comming back.",1708630745.0,

Fxguy1,Work causing all my problems ,2,1awnmqv,6,"As a retail pharmacist I work in very shitty conditions and the anxiety, stress, and ptsd causes me to be a completely different person and a complete asshole. A year ago I was to the point of being suicidal because of all the pressure and lack of help / support. I took time off on mental health disability and returned working for a different company. 

Things were pretty decent at said company but now it has become very similar to the old one. I’m left feeling hopeless that it will ever change or that I’ll be able to find something different. Our district has been short pharmacists to begin with and 3 pharmacists just quit recently. Multiple pharmacies have been closing now due to the lack of any available pharmacists. 3 months ago not a single one ever closed. 

To add to the stress I have a disciplinary action on my record (a final written warning due to accidentally leaving a narcotic on the counter at close) which means I will not be placed in a permanent position in a store and cannot be promoted or anything until that falls off after one year. This is in a district that is hurting for pharmacists yet ……. 

I worked 34 hr per week floating and in Jan told them I can’t work weekends until March 1st. I started in June and have only worked 5 weekend days total since then. The response was to immediately drop me to 16 hours a week on Monday and Friday only. 

My life coach keeps telling me to change my thinking and have a positive attitude all the while I keep telling her that it’s because of this job that I’m a complete asshole and have such negative thinking. When I’m not at work or working a different job I’m a completely different person. Due to finances I’m left in what feels like a situation that there is no hope of emerging from. 

Yesterday at work I came very close to that spot I was in a year ago. Today I woke up feeling good and forgetting about it and ready to enjoy my birthday. Then I had a counselor session followed by another one where all we did was talk about yesterday. I hated the fact that today is my only day off and my birthday and I have had it stolen by spending the day talking about the horrible day yesterday. And when I thought I was going to be able to chill and forget about it, my wife scheduled a joint session with my life coach because she is scared and trying to help. 

That just made me talk about it even more when I just want to be left alone. It really made me angry and feeling hatred to the likes I’ve never felt before. (I’m not crazy stupid so not going to hurt anyone) after the session I came home and wrote a note saying “stop fucking trying to help me. I have never felt such hatred” and taped it to the computer. I grabbed my phone, iPad, and switch and left. I’m parked in the middle of a corn field alone which is helping. I turned off find my location I think as an added take that. 

Is there any financial help for someone in this situation? The honest solution is I need to find something else. But I can’t afford to quit until I have found something else. I’m scared that in the meantime the pressure is going to build to the point it pushes me over the edge.

AnniesNote,Am I lazy or just depressed,9,1av6orq,3,"30F and I think I’m failing at life. I got kicked out of college when I was 20 because of my severe anxiety and depression kept me from going to classes. I quit my shitty job as a dishwasher at a pizza place, moved across the country for a month, ran out of livable income, and have since then been living with my parents. I lost my job  nearly 4 years ago, again from depression (and burnout) and it broke me. It was the first job I’d ever been fired from and losing it just made my depression spiral into a worse condition. 

 Two years ago I was in a car accident that left me on rest and recovery for about four months, then three months after that had a cancer diagnosis that required surgical removal. I got an online job that lasted an entire two months before they let everyone go in my department due to cost cuts. 

I currently live in my hometown, at home with my mom (my dad passed this last November—I’m still grieving over that), have no social life, and have honestly never even been on a date. I’ve been living off money from the settlement I received from my car accident and I just feel defeated and useless. I’ve been in therapy for 3 years but I’m just as depressed, if not more, than I was when I started; and after needing to switch medications in December, my anxiety has been off the walls and my depression still unmanageable. I’m constantly tired, have zero motivation, and I don’t even know where to start to get back on the adulting train.

,How do I stop thinking about how my girlfriend hurt me?,1,1auyfez,0,"I love my girlfriend. I truly do. We have been together for a long time, but I get lots of anxiety attacks that I am trying to work through. I am going to therapy, reading articles and working on myself, but nothing seems to help. I don't want to break up with my girlfriend, but I get frequent panic attacks and so sad, on occasion.

Me and my girlfriend are in a healthy relationship. We have lots of communication and we talk every day. We make it an effort to chat and have a conversation every night. Last year, I called my usual time, and noticed she did not pick up. She had texted she was watching television, so I figured we could do our own thing. I didn't think much of it, we often have a few nights like that. 

I figured she had went to sleep shortly thereafter when I called late. The next day, she texted me, and didn't confess she had spoken to her ex. 

I found out through a close friend and aide. It broke me, mentally, physically, and although this has been over six-months, I still get anxiety, depression, and self-anguish. I still have trauma, thinking anytime she doesn't call late at night, she could be speaking to an ex. 

To her credit, I should not have known, but once I did, she's made every effort to be more committed to me. She's apologized, been more communicative, and worked with me. She's given me time, space, and the energy to grieve. She's reassured me, and even gone backwards for me. 

Although I want to believe she is faithful, loyal, and transparent, there's this little thing in the back of my mind, that at any point in the day, not even late at night now, she could be talking to her ex. It just eats at me, and I'm reminded by how much it hurt.

My girlfriend thought I was over it, but I just hadn't brought it up, because she asked me not to. However, I'd be lying if I didn't say the feelings still come up, sometimes multiple times a day, weekly, or at random moments.

I confessed that I still was dealing with the trauma, and she's asked me not to bring it up, since all I did for three-weeks straight, was ask why did she do that? She's apologized time and time again, and even cut her exe out of her life.

,Work related anxiety I guess ,1,1aunikk,7,"Work related anxiety I guess

Hi, I started in the work force about 2.5 years ago, I got a job at a different state from my family, so I rented a house there and worked there. The first  month was ok, quite boring, nothing to do, then the next month I got terrible anxiety not sure why out of the blue, I told my parent and everything. I thought I could tough it out. But I broke, then I left the job, and came back home and got a temporary contract job, which I worked for 2 month trying to get my shit  together, before getting my current permanent job. During this time, I was going to my cousin for therapy, he asked me to do affirmations and did Behavioural Therapy and just gave me advice and some hypnosis stuff too, he is still abit inexperienced about 200hrs of practice but it helps slightly. 

I started working in my company about 2 years ago, for the first 6 months I was doing OK this was in december 2022, eventually, my boss told me I was getting promoted in a years time. Slowly, I developed fears and get scared for every part of my job, I can do the job, its not that hard, but the workload gets heavy very fast and often, Colleagues are decent, bosses are supportive, salary quite good, but my job is slightly abit too niche,it may be beneficial in a long run but Im not sure. I get anxious on and off when dealing with customers and leading Factory Acceptance Tests. 

I have been in the same type of therapy with him for a while, but I'm starting to doubt talking will solve my issues. At one point it got worse, I went to a psychiatrist, he prescribed me, Valdoxan 25mg, it kinda helped me buy muffling the fear, like covering a scream with a pillow and anxiety but made me blank and moody, the anxiety started to crawl back up after a while, so I stopped after 3 weeks knowing I dont need to taper down or anything, I felt ok for a while, but the anxiety is lesser but always there right before work, every day, making me want to quit every time, I dont know why. 

Fast forward to recently, our company was on a break for 6 days, a long awaited break, 3 days in I was fine, then i started to have a terrible gut wrenching feeling right below my sturnum going down words, I recognise this feeling, I had this when I was at 12, 15, 17 years old, right before major exams, I think it was the fear of failure. Since the middle of the holiday, It is still here till today, I tell my self and my mind I am fine, I have nothing to worry, if I get fired(which is probably unlikely), fk it ill get a new job. I dont know what to do, I cant keep this up its torture.

What3venIsReddit,Repressed Trauma(long but idk where else to go),1,1aucj4s,0,"
34(F) I've struggled with my mental health since as long as I can remember. I believe it began when I was molested by a friend of my mother & step father. When I reached out to a friend to explain what had happened to me, it was reported to school but not the police.. (no clue why) I remember my mother bringing me to a therapist, but staying in the room the whole time.. I wasn't allowed to get the help I needed. My mother made me lie to the school and the therapist saying I made everything up. I did because I was afraid of her(mentally & physically abusive alcoholic) Because of all of that I am afraid to trust any professional. I still don't understand how my mother was able to manipulate everyone involved that I made it all up. I remember the smell of his shitty cologne, the coors can that was left on my dresser and having to scrub blood out of my underwear the next morning because I was afraid to tell anyone what happened. It had to have been my fault in some way (at least that's what I felt at the time.I started cutting my wrists, thighs and carving words into my legs. A few attemps of overdosing on my mothers pills. Drank what I could steal from her stash. Something happened at some point in time where I just kind of snapped myself out of it to force myself to get better. I repressed the memories of being molested and abuse from my mother. Learned to deal with my mental health(poorly)on my own without a therapist and never told another soul about what happened, not even ever to my husband.


Fast forward to my first pregnancy..

 I had PPD with my 1st child, but it turned into something so different for me mentally. Feeling like I was outside my body, running on auto pilot, constant need of praise or some kind of encouragement that I was worth living. I started drifting back into my depression days after birth and then it became something so much worse. I felt detached from the world, not remembering anything. All my days felt like they ran right into one another but at the same time felt never ending. It was a terrifying experience to have to go through and I wouldn't wish it on my least favorite person in the world

I struggled to talk about any of my feelings even with my husband. HUGE MISTAKE. I wanted to pretend the thoughts weren't there, and I managed to convince myself in some ways that I was okay mentally. I remember feeling like I couldn't come to my husband with everything because I was afraid he not only wouldn't of understood, but may have just up and left me completely.  I've always been broken and I didn't want him to see me that way. In the mix of all of that I let another man into my life. Not physically in anyway (HUGE issues with men putting their hands on me in anyway because of my past.), but he flirted with me at work alot, and it got to the point where I flirted back. It became an emotional affair. As far as why all I can remember is wanting to feel desirable and appreciated. Looking back now I'm sure I was disassociating,  I needed an escape from my thoughts. Never in a million years would I have thought I could do anything like that, but I did and I will never be able to forgive myself for it. I should have brought up my past with my husband at that point, at least to try to make him understand that I could never cross that line physically, but I never did. I still fucked everything up by even talking to someone else, so would it have even mattered at that point. 


Most recently my husband brought up a time where I was pregnant with our second child where I apparently got in my car, drove into the yard and said I was going to kill myself. I have literally no memory of ANY of that. My question is what type of mental illness can cause memory loss to that point. It clearly was a huge event in my life, but why can't I remember it. Hearing about this pushed me into looking for help. Is it similar to other repressed memories I have? I feel so lost and am terrified of remembering more about my past. I still haven't been able to bring myself to talk to a professional so I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything. I was diagnosed with major cronic depression from my family doctor before I even became pregnant with my 1st child. I took meds for about a month, but had bad side effects so just stopped. From what I've read online(countless hours researching) I could even have a few different mental illnesses. I have alot of the same ""signs"" for borderline personality disorder, Depersonalization/derealization disorder ,Dissociative identity disorder, Anxiety and Major Depression. I don't know where to even start with getting help because of how paranoid I am about talking with a therapist. I know I need to so I can get the help I've needed for so long but I'm terrified.

Well where do I begin, it’s been a pretty rough start to the new year, at least from a personal level. I have never really been a positive or happy person despite what my parents continue to reiterate to me. I am pessimistic and for the most part I have gotten use to my outlook on life but even for me it is getting tiring. How can I muster up the energy to go outside if all I feel is glaring and judging eyes looking at me, how can I go outside and pursue a career when the first thought of putting myself out there is negative judgment. 

I recently graduated from university and for me a person who experienced so much anxiety it was a miracle. But now I don’t see a step forward, what do I do next. Without the structure of classes I am lost and because of my fear of judgement I just can’t muster up the energy to apply for anything I am qualified for.

I tell my parents and instead of helpful advice I just keep getting bombarded with negative words. Lecturing me on why I should have a job already, why I should have a relationship or why I should be like all the other NORMAL people they see around them. Doesn’t help that my neurodivergence was not detected until I was already an adult and that my neurotypical YOUNGER brother is finding life easy. And I know that it is easy to say that as an outsider that my Golden Brother may not find life easy, but I know he does.

Today was just another day of me being told what I should be doing, how I should be doing things and that I am wasting my life. Leading me to feel alone and worthless. It would be so easy to just cut my arm like I normally do but make it deeper, wrap my throat and feel the pressure before darkness takes over. 
But then I feel bitter about what my death would invertible cause, my parents lying about who I was (a person they never spent time getting to know) playing mourning figures when they could never care about me when/while I am alive. The less than a handful of friends who showed me love remembering the good times but also the bad. Many of which may never find out about my death because I have such a separation between family and those who I care about.

The only thing keeping me from ending it all is that fear of being remembered incorrectly, being thought of in ways that are fabrications from a parent’s vanity.

I wake up in the morning and feel extremely anxious and then as the day goes on i feel less anxious and in the afternoon I start feeling depressed and have a headache and by night I am super depressed and my head really hurts.  
This feels really physical to me. Like there is nothing I am anxious or depressed about. Every day I go from anxious to depressed. My doctor has had me try meds like SSRIs but they don't really do anything for me. What does help is when I take a Benzo I feel perfectly fine (even with the depression and headaches) so I feel like I have some clear chemical problem. Exercise also helps a bit. Should I go to a hospital? Can anyone relate and what did they do??  
One other note is that my heartrate is really high when I do any activity even like standing up which I heard might be some sign of something.",1708133715.0,

However, husband was let go recently and it has of course triggered his anxiety and depression. So while I'm trying to be supportive and encouraging and positive he's starting fights by insulting me  because he knows I won't let it slide and he can then accuse me of being hysterical and the problem with everything. 

I know the things he says are not true and are coming from a place in him that I have no control over. He and I have talked at length about both my problems and his in the past. I am actively doing something about mine and have been; I'm going to therapy and I'm on medication and I'm doing my own work on myself.

Chu_Nam_1988,Overcoming Depression and Self-Doubt: A Personal Journey,1,1as5rx2,0,"Scrolling through many out there struggling with signs of depression particularly lack of belief and confidence in themselves, I want to share my journey overcoming personal depression and lack of confidence with the hope that it might impact some of you going through similar hardships.

Previously, for a long time, I felt like I was trapped in a dark tunnel with no end in sight. Depression weighed heavily on me, and self-doubt crept into every corner of my mind, whispering that I wasn't good enough, that I wasn't trying hard enough, that I would never amount to anything. It was a suffocating feeling, even making me feel physically tight in the chest and breathless, seeming like there was no way out.

But I refused to let these negative thoughts define me. I sought help, reaching out to friends, family, and ultimately professional advice. Opening up about my own struggles was one of the hardest things I've ever done; I even shared my issues on my personal blog with people everywhere seeing my vulnerability, my desire to break free from it all, feeling a bit ashamed, but also the most liberated I've ever felt. It made me realize that I wasn't alone in this battle and that there were people genuinely concerned about my well-being.

Exploring honesty with myself and receiving guidance from experts was a game-changer for me. It provided me with tools and coping mechanisms to challenge my negative thoughts and develop a more positive outlook on life. I learned to cultivate mindfulness, be kinder to myself on days when everything felt overwhelming.

Beyond therapy for the mind, I made lifestyle changes to improve my mental health. I started exercising regularly, prioritizing sleep, and nurturing perspectives and beliefs through activities like self-reflection, meditation, and yoga. I even decided to take a break from social media for a while to stop caring about external things and focus on myself. These small changes added up and contributed to an overall sense of happiness for me; I felt healthier both mentally and physically.

But perhaps the most significant change happened within me – a change in perspective. I began to see my struggles not as weaknesses but as opportunities for growth. Each failure became a lesson, each challenge an opportunity to prove to myself that I was stronger than I thought.

It wasn't an easy journey, and there were obstacles along the way. There were dark days threatening to engulf me, piled-up difficulties, work and life pressures weighing heavily on my mind and body, but I held onto the hope that things would get better if I persevered and didn't give up – and they did.

Today, I can proudly say that my spirit is much stronger. I've learned to accept my flaws and imperfections, understanding that they make me unique. I find joy in simple things and gratitude for every day I'm gifted, especially in seeing advantages in all life situations, always helping me develop something.

If you're struggling with depression and lack of confidence, know that you're not alone. Reach out for help, whether it's through counseling, support groups, or trusted loved ones. And remember, healing isn't a straight path – there may be ups and downs throughout the process because even for those who don't face these issues, there are always pressures and challenges in life to face and overcome.

You deserve love and happiness, and you deserve to live a fulfilling and authentic life for yourself. Keep fighting, keep believing in yourself, and never lose hope.",1708080685.0,

I'm a US veteran, and I've been going through a tough time since leaving the service three years ago. Recently, I've mustered up the courage to start utilizing my benefits and seeking help from doctors.

I visited a psychiatrist a couple of weeks ago and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The doctor prescribed Lexapro and recommended therapy, which I'll be starting soon. It's been a difficult journey managing my mental health while juggling school and work, which eventually led me to quit my job. Even focusing on school has become overwhelming.

On top of that, I've lost touch with most of my friends, and my roommates see me as a liability. The trauma from my military service has been weighing heavily on me, and I've struggled to process it until now.

With everything going on in the world and my financial struggles, I often feel lost and alone. The only solace I find is with my boyfriend, but I'm hesitant to burden him with my issues. While I've shared my diagnosis with him, I haven't started my medication out of fear of how it might affect our relationship.

I’ve been dealing with social anxiety for over my entire life. I was and still am, the shy kid.

Higher than me.

I finally worked up the courage after several panic attacks and crying…. and he won't do it. Which is stupid because I really don't think he knows how bad really I am because I’m so uncomfortable every time I see him I hardly can ever say anything (we also switched depression medications after I saw him in December and it does absolutely nothing for my anxiety so that part is probably completely unmanaged right now) and we don't have a formal meeting until March— one that I'm so ashamed of going to because in even asking for the excuse he made me feel like such a stupid idiot that I'm seriously considering skipping the session because I’m too afraid to talk to him.

I see all these people that have their purpose in life and work hard every day, they grind and they're achieving their goals, and fucking love what they do. All the football players, basketball players, guys that do some martial arts, even some YouTubers. Personally I know a guy that makes music beats and he actually is making a good progress. They all just have something they love and they grind 24/7.

I don't have that thing. I don't have anything to work on and I feel so lost. I have that energy, I want to grind on something but simply don't know what it is. I don't have my dream sport that I wanna be a pro in, any dream job and stuff like that. I wanna be successful in life, I wanna make a very good money, I wanna do something great with my life, I'd say that I'm very ambitious but just dont have purpose.


And because of this my social life struggles I bit too. Don't get me wrong, I got friends, I'm not like some awkward dude but I think it lacks a bit.

I'm in highschool now. Problem is that in my school there's 99% guys. No girls at all. For these couple years I saw a few girls in school, I'm not kidding.

I don't wanna make excuses but maybe it's sounds like it (or maybe I'm actually making excuses LOL) but they can meet girls easily while I don't even see them cuz there aren't any in my school.

I have made some serious strides over the past few months as there was a time me when I did not think I could work full time.
I try to exercise most days, eat right, get enough (drugged) sleep.

Problem is that the medication has only slightly helped the situation and I still have anxiety/depression and occasional sleep problems.

Yesterday, I told my wife that my anxiety/distress ratchets up when she and my 10 month old daughter come home.  And it’s always worse in the weekend when we are all home together. Probably not something she wanted to hear but it is the truth.  

I would love to be able to have relaxed conversations/interactions with my wife and daughter but many times I end up in freeze mode where I don’t want to move which makes it hard to do anything-including just talking, thinking or being there in the present moment.

I would love to resolve this issue and not be anxious around them but this has been going on for about a year.  I told my therapist that at this point it’s like a Pavlovian response-just happens.

It’s been 2 months and can’t stop worrying if there’s something wrong in my body. And I always overthink. I don’t have a proper sleep because of this.

And every time I was worrying all the things I’m doing and all the movements on my body. I was overthinking all of it to the point I can’t concentrate or focus at all. I always feel sad and stress and I don’t know what to do to make it stop. It’s almost 2 months I experience this and I have no one talk to because My parents have their own family. I was living with my grandma.

I just need an advice and how to calm myself.

Royal_Connection_497,"Life long insecurity, self hate, imposter syndrome, basically like a ""self existence dysmorphia"" has been ruining my entire life. I wish I knew how others perceived me",3,1aloiis,1,"I dont even know where to start.  
  
I keep trying to write this but it just seems like im stroking my ego. I know there are so many people that actually have shitty circumstances but its like my brain is stuck in this weird spot where I cant accept what I have.   
  
Im doing great at work. It seems like most coworkers and my boss love me. I can fuck around as much as I want (within reason) and the boss never really gets mad at me as long as I clean up which I do. I play hard, I work hard. If any issues do come up he usually takes my side with little consideration.   
  
I have friends that I know genuinely care about me with things they've done or said throughout the years.  
  
I dont understand why its so hard to accept this.   
  
For some reason I always felt like the last pick for everything and like I was useless.  
  
My parents HATED that I was a very energetic, loud, and expressive child so maybe now I force myself to hide that?  
  
Im super shy and quiet and I hate that about myself. The few people I trust know how loud and rowdy I get but everyone sees this hidden reserved side of me which I attribute to my parents always calling me an embarrassment basically?  
  
They never praised me for my good work. If I ever did anything good the usual answers I got  are ""why didn't do more?"" or ""you want to be noticed/rewarded for something you're already supposed to be doing.""  
  
I also know that I used to be a huge fucking bully back in elementary school. idk why but I loved pissing people off I guess. pretty much all of my current friends told me that when they first met me I'd bully and pick at them.  
  
I think this gave me very little friends, and the perception that I was just unlikeable? Obviously that shit fucked me up throughout higher grades and I was super quiet and shy thinking people hated me for no reason.  
  
Now im nice and care for people, work hard and people seem to like me and all I can think of is how they're all faking it to be nice for some reason.  
  
Maybe its cuz I bullied people, maybe its cuz my parents were kinda jerks, but I grew up thinking I was worthless and unlikeable.   
  
But now im working hard on my socializing with people and general work ethic and people like me. People invite me to hangouts, people initiate conversation with me, they dont seem grossed out or anything by my presence and its just really hard to accept.   
  
I keep thinking like ""I just need one more person to say something nice about me"" but I've had that SO many times already. I worked really hard to get where I am but I cant accept it.   
  
I kinda wish there was a way to know how people view me.   
  
I see attractive people, smart people, funny people, and everyone gets their own little like general personality ""tab.""  
  
The smart friends that always have answers for everything, the funny friends that seem to be  entertaining with zero effort, the insanely charismatic and adventurous ones that take charge and have an adventure every meet up.   
  
What the fuck am I?  
  
In my head im some like awkward little dude that kinda hides and people are slightly uncomfortable to be around.  
  
I wish I just had a way to know how others saw me.  
  
I can infer from what people tell me but I can never be too sure and that uncertainty usually turns to doubt and then self hatred again.  
  
Like are there people that respect me? Are there people that notice how funny I am or at least try to be/think I am, are there people who think im just stupid or maybe goofy on purpose? Are there people that respect me for the work I do or do they know im more or less guessing/faking it and making it look good?  
  
Its just that I have so many like opinions about people. What they're good at, what they're bad at, how they loo, all this and that.  
  
It kills me not knowing how others see me and what they think of me.

Since I’ve been mostly unemployed. I’ve been reffing basketball to make some money, but it’s less than half my normal salary. I’ve felt like a loser, regret over leaving my former position, and running into issues trying to get employment within the same industry due to a vindictive former supervisor that is very connected in the industry. Im very qualified and good at what I do. I just didn’t like that asshole. So I quit.  I feel like it’s damaged my future success. 

During this time I fell apart. I really hit a low about 3-4 weeks ago. Since I’ve had a few offers and think I’ve settled on picking one option. I’ve been feeling a little better, but still very up and down with a ton of anxiety. On scale if my hitting low was me at 20% of my normal self I’m only back to feeling 50% my best (if that makes sense).  

Some of my current stress is picking between 2 options. Neither are perfect, but both pay between $60-$65K. I should be happy with this, yet im just terrified instead. 

Now with the thought of starting a new position, training, paperwork, meeting a bunch of new people and clients. Trying to find my way in a very different role than I’ve had. I know I have a skill set that will translate well, only it’s still very different. Im nervous, anxious, and feeling the fight or flight feeling and it’s yelling RUN!  
 
Having a hard time picking between these 2 options and in general scared of both. Having the fear is also bothering me because it’s making me feel weak. Through this process I felt like a loser. Suicide has even been a thought. I won’t do it, just something that has been in my head.

I was medicated for anxiety/depression for many years, but found that the medication made me so exhausted that I wasn’t able to function (falling asleep during inappropriate times and sleeping through important life events). So for about 4 months now I’ve been off of medication I took for 10+ years (regardless of the lethargy- I took the fatigue over the anxiety). 

I’m just at my wits end. My house and living space is a mess, feeding myself and up-keep in terms of hygiene is really hard for me. If I’m not scrolling or watching something to distract myself, I’m so anxious and aware of my nausea. 

I’ve been dealing with gastrointestinal issues for the past 3 months. I went off work in mid-November and the only day I’ve gone in so far was once last week. I’m in a high-stress job and I go in tomorrow. I find that my health anxiety is through the roof. I’m constantly worrying about throwing up at work or having to leave early (because I’m responsible for about 30 other people during the day). I love what I do, but when feeling sick, I find that my anxiety around being sick is debilitating. 

When I’m at home and not working (so, a typical day for me lately), I’m scrolling to distract myself. I only connect with my one family member, and don’t chat much with friends (mostly because I’m anxious and find it hard to reach out and communicate with friends). I find it hard to keep up with laundry and chores, and don’t know how to stop myself from distracting myself from reality to avoid stress and responsibility. I just really need some compassion and connection, and hoped this as the right place to find understanding, and maybe even advice.

I’ve been dealing with anxiety over the course of my life span. At first, I didn’t know how to deal with my anxiety, I never talked to someone, mention anything about my anxiety, not even know that I was dealing with it. Until now, I’ve finally figured it out how ti deal with my anxiety, by listening to music. I’m so happy that I found music to cope my anxiety. Otherwise I would’ve taken medications for it which I wasn’t a big fan of. Music has changed on how to deal my anxiety and I’m forever grateful about it to this day. 

Unfortunately for my depression, I’m still working on it, music is working well but I still need to figure out how to deal with my depression.

Bluelily00,Moving out anxiety,1,1ajb28o,1,"Hello I am a 23F and I just moved out of my parents house and into an apartment with my boyfriend of 3 years (26M). He has lived on his own since 18. I moved in yesterday and have cried 2 times the night before, 4 times the day of, and 3 times today. 
I didn’t move far only about 20 min but I feel so anxious all the time. There are good parts but I miss my parents and my animals and the comfort of home. I wish I wasn’t an adult and didn’t have to leave home eventually. I keep feeling like I’m not ready but if not know then when? Does this anxiety and such mean I don’t love my boyfriend? 
I grew up having horrible seperation anxiety from my mom and twin sister but this feels a bit like that but also like more. I sit here and think “this is my life, I’m away from my parents and will never truly be in their care again” they are my safe space. I feel I’m going to miss out on a bunch and that I won’t have them here when I need them. I have a fear of getting sick and they say I can always come home when I’m sick but it’s different. 
This place doesn’t feel like home and I know it may be because of boxes but I also just miss my pets so much. 
I was here alone today so I visited home and felt a lot better but my depression is kicking in. 
I just can’t believe this is it. I’m out of my parents house and I just want to go back. But if I go back then it will really hurt my relationship and possibly set me backwards in life. Every box I unpack gives me anxiety and I keep thinking of the worst such as, “how would I pack this all up if my boyfriend and I broke up?” Like I feel like I’m always planning for the worst as a way to protect myself. 
I have no idea what to do. We plan on getting a pet within a month or 2 because I know my big thing is having a pet around but these last 3 days have been so much emotionally and I have to work tomorrow which is just adding anxiety.

I am currently on mirtazapine and as needed clonazepam and am in therapy. I like this treatment plan as I am quite hesitant on trying ssri's since I really do not want the sexual side effects/potential PSSD and also because the main side effects of mirtazapine (increasing appetite and making you go to sleep) are actually benefits in my case as my anxiety completely kills my appetite and gives me insomnia if I dont take something sedative.

I have been making pretty good progress compared to where I was a month ago but I feel as though the last thing which is truly holding back my progress is physical anxiety which appears unconsciously in high stimulus situations or in stressful social situations. Mentally I'll be fine and have no rational thing im afraid of but its like my body just fails me : my breathing will get really tight making it hard to even talk and my heart rate starts going insanely high which brings on a whole host of other debilitating physical symptoms. All this can often cause me to spiral into a full blown panic attack where I sometimes have no choice but to excuse myself and call an uber home.I have read that low dose beta blockers are sometimes used with great success in treating exactly this and so I wanted to request this from my doctor tomorrow. 

I am looking for one which can preferably be taken on an 'as needed' basis and which does not interfere with asthma or with the asthma medication that I take daily (simbicort). Any information would be extremely appreciated and even if there are recommendations for other meds I could try it would be extremely helpful! Thank you very much",1707080104.0,

Dizziness started in mid November 2021, went to Canberra on the 10th of December and I had my first near faint experience followed by high heart beat and palpitation. 

Dizziness and lightheaded was followed till the 28th of December when I nearly fainted again and had really high heart rate: went to hospital. They did blood work and ecg couldn’t find a probable cause. Went to hospital again 3 days later and no findings were evident. Upon my 3rd visit to hospital X-ray was done off my chest and nothing was found. I was bedridden for 6 weeks, everyday was a battle for life, I felt like I was in septic shock everyday. I had to get iv fluids about 10 times because of dehydration, I sweated constantly with no appetite for water or food.

Symptoms 

Lightheaded 
Dizziness
Heart gets tired quickly 
Sometimes my arms and hands become a little numb.
My head feels tension.
heat in my abdomen, back and my ears get hot.
Feels like a pulsating feeling through my body during a bad episode 
Sometimes left shoulder feels warm
My eyes sometimes drop tears randomly
Unable to concentrate at times
Shortness of breath during episode 
There’s always a tense feeling in my chest and around my heart area. Sometimes hits my lower abdomen and I feel nausea makes my stomach make noises. I have difficulty sleeping my head spins more when I close my eyes. I wake up between 1-3am with a weird feeling as if I’m scared or something. Vision sometimes becomes blurry. Fatigue and tiredness. Little sudden Noises scare me. Whenever I have a episode that peaks, my hands and feet get sweaty and I feel heat. My hands and feet sometimes get cold. The feeling in my mid left chest area I can’t explain but it’s as if my muscles are vibrating. When I stand up it’s seems my head and chest symptoms get worse for about a minute and then settle down. Same thing happens when I lay down. It gets worse for a minute till it goes back to how it was. Sometimes I can feel it hitting my front part of my head and my sinus feels tense as well. As well as my ears feel the pressure. Lying down seems to reduce some tension in my head. I feel bad 80% of the day really bad 15% of the day and alright 5% of the day.


Let’s go back to my childhood, my earliest memory is probably when I was around 10. If I would focus on my breathing it felt like I couldn’t breath anymore. I also had these unexplained spinning and dizziness at a young age during sleep time. Doctors couldn’t find anything. I was always a scared kid thinking about the worse case scenario that might kill me but in reality it was overthinking. In highschool a few times I nearly fainted out of the blue. Sometimes during sports I’ll hit a point where out of no where my heart would start racing and my breathing would become laboured. Sometimes over excitement caused this as well.

Now medications 

Lexapro 40mg for 6 months, no benefits. Made me really bad during the first 2 weeks and kinda of settled after that, dumbed the depressive symptoms but that’s about it. Felt much better after coming off, it definitely made my condition worse. Derealisation, fatigue, tiredness, forgetfulness. All of it.

Zoloft 50mg for 18 days and 100mg for 3 days, had a panic attack on day 3 I thought it was Zoloft but found it to be thc later on. Discontinued Zoloft then. No benefits during the 18 days on 50mg and made my condition way worse.

Paxil 20mg for 2 months, probably one of the strongest reactions to any ssri, daily panic attacks losing my mind, as if there’s a laughter in my head but it’s my internal monologue creating it but still I was losing it. Pushed on for 2 months and it just made me worse as the days went on.

Agomelatine 20mg no benefits, daily panic attacks, took it for about 36 days.

Pristiq, I’m on day 54 and I’ve stopped taking it, my last dose was on Wednesday not sure how to stop. It’s making me worse, mood is swinging, brain fog and all other symptoms are reappearing on this medication.

Clonidine didn’t do much except relax my body alittle

Lyrica, knocked me out at 25mg and made me tired. No benefits.

Valium 5mg, very small relief, short benefits 3-5 hours, more of a muscle relaxant, addictive in nature.

Clonezapam 1mg, small amount of relief, short relief 3-5 hours. 

Xanax 2mg, haven’t tried 

Ativan 1mg only have tried 0.5mg and it didn’t do much.

Seroquel 25mg, good for sleep, couldn’t sleep for more then 4 hours for the last 5 years or so, now I get a solid 8 hours, it’s not a 100% good quality sleep but it gets the job done, I don’t feel tired through the day as before I got sick.

Epilim haven’t tried chickenend out

Lamictal discontinued on day 3 after developing rash

Lithium 500mg, 37 days. Left like losing my mind not sure if adverse reaction to the lithium or it was some kind of discontinuation I was getting from the lexapro. 

Prozac 4 days to bridge off lexapro 

Thc/cbd oil, made me go full panic mode for 4 hours each time I tried it. Very similar to what I was feeling with the Paxil minus the laughter side effect. 

Symptoms 

Dizziness 
Burning tongue
Headache
Nausea 
Metallic taste in mouth
Hot flushes 
Muscle pain and tension
Fatigue 
Numbness in hands
Pins and needles
Brain fog
Startled easily
Blood pressure problems 
Heart feeling heavy
Fast heart beat 
Feel like I’m dying
Losing my mind
Losing control
Very negative thoughts 
Intrusive thoughts 
Hyper reactive 
Blurry vision 
Cold palms and feet
Sweaty palms and feet
Hot flushes 
Feeling sick / flu like
Weak limbs
Digestion problems 
Numbness
Nightmares 

My physical symptoms cycle throughout the weeks and I’m never symptomsless. Physical or cognitive I always feel something.

My mind always feels like as if something is off,

As my overall condition gets worse my brain fogs becomes really bad and my hands and feet become so cold to the touch, 

I become very forgetful

I can never stop thinking about my condition, my mind is occupied by it 24/7

When I’m on medications l as ssri’s I get irrational fears such as being allergic to nuts or something crazy. But seems to go away after a month when discontinuing  the medication,

Lightheaded, feel like my neck muscles are so tense that my brain isn’t getting enough blood.

I’m hyper focused on all bodily functions physical or Cognitive, if I suspect something that is schizophrenic or damaging I get a mini panic attack. But panic attack do occur for no reason as well most of the times.

Trigger warning

Crisis ⚠️ 

I’ve just been hit with the reality of the situation. I feel physically nauseous and dizzy. 

I told the social worker everything that happened w me and him. She has had to report it to the child and family agency. 

The child and family agency said if I go near him the police will be contacted immediately. 

When my he finds out about this he might actually kill me. I fucked his and my life up beyond repair. 

Somebody please help me because I feel like I’m drowning. My biggest fear was being a single mum. Now I’m living with my Nmom without even my bank card or hairbrush or anything.

 If I went to collect my things from his house the police could be called and social services have told me if I go near him I’m putting my unborn baby in danger and have implied that would make me an unfit mother. 

I’m actually living in hell right now. 

There is no therapy available. I’ve asked for months. I’m on the waiting list for a psych appointment a week after my baby is due. They don’t help bc they just offer medication. 

Why the fuck have I done this. I regret ever telling the social worker anything. Now I’m left alone. Living with my fucked up mother and her new supply in a tiny apartment. 

I fucked up his chances of having a child with someone by talking to social services. This is so serious and I’m only realising all of this now. My child is already fatherless even tho my bf begged to be in her and my life. 

What have I done?

If he ever has a child again social services will be involved. I will never get them out of my life. Instead of helping me they have worsened things. How the fuck can all of this happen and there is no therapy available. 

I’ve carried this baby for 8 months and I’m not able to look after her. The only option I can see is adoption. This is the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. I’m too pussy to kill myself so I want to go back to him, after I put the baby for adoption and I want to let him kill me. He was going to do it eventually anyway. 

I can’t imagine a worse pain than having to give away a baby. But honestly I never wanted a baby. It was always something he wanted. And now I’m left with it on my own. 

Adoption is the only answer because I don’t want me and my baby to be homeless or living with my abusive mother. 

Where can I run to? I can’t believe there is an innocent life tangled up in this. 

I’ve learned to never open up again. I’ll die with my mouth shut now. I miss him and if I go back then social workers will take my baby. 

I don’t deserve this baby. 

My mother’s not phased by any of it. I’m living with someone who puts on a front about how much she cares. But in reality all she cares about is appearances. I’m lying in bed all day. There is nothing to do. 

I can’t believe I’m only 22 and I’ve already ruined 3 lives. Mine, my ex’s and my poor baby’s life. There is still 3 weeks until I’m full term so I have a chance to turn her life around by adoption. But it’s going to kill me. Honestly after giving my own baby away I think that would give me the courage to just end it. 

I carried her for 9 months just for someone else to take her. That is a pain worse than death. And I can’t imagine life getting any better, I keep reaching new lows. 

I fucked up his life and I don’t blame him for wanting to kill/torture me for it. What sort of a person am I? I’m ashamed of myself. I deserve whatever he does to me, and worse. 

If I’m not being abused by him I’m being abused by my mother. I can’t escape. I can’t even leave the country because I only have €100 and no plan.

anxiouslyeverafter,Anxiety attack deterrents?,1,1ahjkx3,2,"For background, my depression goes through cycles that seem to be random in length and severity. 

While I call the less depressed portion a ""high"" cycle, usually it's a period of time in which I just don't care about anything. I eat because I know I have to, I work so I can work on trying to improve my life, and otherwise don't really do anything outside of absolute necessity. 

The ""low"" cycles can be as mild as just being the emotional equivalent of a septic tank or as bad as putting things in order to end it all. 

I just ended a high cycle and can tell that this low cycle is going to be horrendous. This month is always horrible, between Valentine's Day, my birthday which also happens to be the anniversary of my ex breaking up with me, three friends' and family members' wedding anniversaries I feel compelled to help celebrate, and all the associated media, products, conversations, text messages, emails, and reminders for these events; it just gets so overwhelming and every time I turn around I get blindsided by something else. 

Historically speaking, I feel worse and worse and worse as the month goes by, and I can tell that this year is going to be just so much worse. Thinking about it for just a couple of minutes just now triggered a major anxiety attack.

What can I do to mitigate the anxiety attacks? Are there supplements I can take that might help? I want to be proactive about it this year instead of reactive since that hasn't worked for the last nine years.

Therapy isn't really an option at this time as I don't have the extra $2000 annually for it. Antidepressants mess withy head in bad ways or just don't do anything at all. Talking with friends and family either doesn't have any effect or will make things worse.

In about August I was diagnosed with ADHD and started Vyvanse. Recently increased it to 75 mg dose. I’m also on Effexor and buspirone for anxiety and depression. During this time I have experienced life stressors so it’s been difficult to figure out what’s potentially caused by situational stressors and what may be medication related or ADHD. I’m very unfamiliar with the ADHD territory still. And what all it can affect. I also found out my thyroid medication levels were way too high so I’m waiting to get into my GP next week about that. I guess I’m just looking for any advice or insight or maybe anyone else has experienced something similar, because I honestly cannot figure out what’s going on or what to do. I’m at my breaking point. I hate feeling like I’m second guessing my thinking and my perceived reality, it’s like I’m going crazy. I’ve always had anxiety and depression and this feeling is new.

Scared I’m losing my optimism for a brighter day, scared that I’ve never been this close to not believing in myself anymore. I tell myself I simply need to just get it together and that sounds good in my head at times, but then Ill get so overwhelmed out of nowhere and just breakdown, all while realizing how little it took for that to happen because I seen a guy on the street that resembles someone or a car drive past, or just seeing another person smile.

And I snap on anyone about anything because I’m so frustrated with everything. I don’t wanna think, or do. So therefore I sleep. It doesn’t help, I open my eyes to the same reality I tried to leave when I closed them.

I want to cry at times to let it out but then immediately feel weak for crying rather than taking some sort of other action instead in that moment to fix anything.

This is going to sound kinda stupid because i am only an 8th grader but for the past year or two-ish I’ve been struggling a lot with my eating and mental health. My mom and dad think that I’m just their perfectly perfect daughter, who gets straight A’s, and plays soccer, and always seems “happy”. I’ve been pretty suicidal and have purposely hurt myself a few times in these last years (and even hope to not wake up some nights). plus I get LOTS of anxiety in public and at school.

Right after my parents divorced in 6th grade I sorta felt nothing, empty, no matter what I seemed to do I didn’t care. All I ever wanted to do was go on my phone at my dad’s (since there was literally nothing to do in his small apartment), and my mom had a boyfriend over all the time (who I hated). So basically no matter where I was, I hated it, hated school and home. I hadn’t cried for almost a year after they separated because I felt as if they had been all used up. Then an ed started which made my brain only think worser things.

This last summer, I told my mom that I had bulimia, she almost cried and blamed it on herself because of the divorce. It really wasn’t her fault at all and it made me feel even worse, not to mention that she told everyone i knew (which made it super awkward around family and close friends) and i had to spend half of my summer going through a bunch of recovery stuff that didn’t rly help.

I do go to the gym quite regularly, but tbh I'm even losing enjoyment in that now I only do it to stay fit. I have a career going in IT but having worked in it for almost 3 years now I'm not entirely sure it's what I want to do in the long term so that's beginning to create a lot of stress within myself as I don't know what else I would do, growing up I always wanted to be a content creator like a twitch streamer or youtuber as I enjoy playing games and sharing my passion about it.

Pitiful-Seaweed-432,worried and confused. Help?,1,1acn5s8,3,"I’m 14(F) and im curious as to if i have something wrong with me or not. I know what it sounds like. It may seem like im just another teen who spends too much time on social media and getting the wrong idea and it could just be hormones. My mother takes medication for stress and anxiety. Possibly for bipolar or bpd as well. 

Something isn’t right in my head. SOMETHING is definitely wrong. 
I have major changes in emotions. From feeling fine to wanting to end my life. ETC. You get the gist. 
To the point. I’ve been feeling suicidal since i could even understand what the point of suicide is. I have social anxiety/anxiety in general and it progressively gets worse each year. I’ve tried to take my own life multiple times, never serious enough to work or put me into the hospital. Nobody knows about my attempts. Just somebody i no longer talk to right now. Thought about taking it more than actually attempting. Have trouble with binge eating. Recently started to purge.
When i was in 3rd or 4th grade, i wrote a note to my mom for her to find about me feeling sad and wanting to take my own life. I didn’t attempt, but i felt like i wanted to. My mom obviously saw the note and when she picked me up from school she started yelling at me saying i had to reason to feel like this. And I agree, but why DO i feel like this? Since then i never fully opened up like that towards anyone again. For the past two years my moms made it clear to open up to her about anything. And obviously i refuse to do that. Could you blame me? She got upset last time i told her anything. I’ve suffered with migraines and headaches and recently started seeing a neurologist. He told me it seems like i had a lot of stress and that could most likely be the reason for my headaches. Then prescribed me with propanol, 10 mg twice a day. It helps with physical anxiety but not mentally. Doesn’t help with headaches much either.

Recently I’ve been minorly careless about being mentally closeted towards my mom and told her how i want to be alone all the time, told my friends to leave me to sit alone at lunch for quiet. Like ive always wanted to. And my mom has been asking me if i’m depressed and i don’t know what to say. She got mad at me last time i told her i thought i was. I don’t even know if i’m depressed myself.

My next appointment is this upcoming wednesday and my mom picked up a new prescription for my medication that i take for headaches. She asked me if the medications messed with my head. If it’s affecting my mental health. It hasn’t. I actually have been off of it, not taking it when needed simply because i dont want another thing that i HAVE to do to add onto my daily life. It helps with my anxiety. It causes no harm towards me. As corny as it sounds, i am the harm.  

I had a favorite person and haven’t had a steady or healthy situation with them. They tend to leave then come back. Multiple times and they recently left maybe a month and a half ago. I don’t know if they’re the reason for me feeling worse than usual. But that is what’s happend to me recently. The only thing that could’ve possibly triggered me into getting worse.

Is there anything wrong with me? Am i depressed, do i just have major anxiety. Stress like the doctor said? I don’t know. But it would be nice to have thoughts about it.

The thing is, i FEEL fine. Well most of the time. I just don’t want to interact with anybody. I want to be alone. I feel too not empty, but just blank that i don’t want to waste my energy on anybody.  
My dad, is the only person who i can ACTUALLY open up to. He always asks how im REALLY doing. Him and my mom are divorced so i see him every 2-3 weeks. But that doesn’t mean i do open up to him. I rarely do and lie telling him im fine. He never gets mad at me when i do.

TimeNail,My life story in a nut shell. Can anyone relate?,6,19fa00b,2,"Hi all  
  
In my younger years was anxious, depressed with a sense of hopelessness. Managed to sort myself out to a large degree.  
  
Lived in Asia 2 years and it was great. Little dating opportunities in the UK but loads in Asia. Amazing more dates than I had time for. Truly amazing. Had to come back to the UK due to my apartment and property still being here.  
  
Had a girlfriend in Asia and kept a long distance relationship but I treated her quite badly and didn’t want to hurt her anymore so I broke up with her and feel depressed about that.  
  
Here in the UK it’s tough. Neighbours are noisy and aggressive. I’d like to go back to Asia but I have so much to do here first I feel I will never get a chance to go back.  
  
Struggling with depression and considering anti depressants although I don’t really want to rely on that stuff and I think there are other things I can do first such as exercise, eating better, sleeping better and keeping apartment tidy.  
  
Depression thoughts for me are:  
  
• I am 38. Lots of years wasted in bad jobs and bad relationships  
  
• Feel like I wasted too much time and should have sorted myself out 20 years earlier  
  
• Might never get a meaningful relationship such as wife and kids  
  
• Can’t decide if I even want to have a wife and kids  
  
• Can’t decide what I want with my life and when I do decide I just change my mind  
  
• Sometimes think I just want to travel party and have fun but other times think that is a pointless and meaningless existence.  
  
• Maybe anti depressants could fix this but they could also act as a distraction or be a source of worry for me.  
  
• Noise and aggression from neighbours is unpleasant.  
  
I thought I’d through this out into the internet ether to see if anyone can relate. Sometimes it's amazing how people share such similar stories.

Current-Limit1187,Am I depressed/anxious or lazy?,3,19em2t9,1,"Am I still depressed or lazy?

For context: I got in a bad snowboarding accident two years ago living out west that upended my life overnight & sent me into an off and on 2 year mental health crisis. I lived at home off and on and in the last six months have moved to a beach town/city, work in a great little family owned record shop & live in a nice apartment with my dog and cat. I just bought a gym membership to this hip “athletic club” down the street at the start of the year. My finances are in check, my family is healthy, I am healthier than I’ve been in the last couple years.

It’s Wednesday and I haven’t left my apartment since I got home from work Saturday afternoon. Not even to take my dog out. It’s awful and I can’t believe I’m even writing this on the internet but I can’t even admit it to my therapist and I know I need help. It’s disgusting. I haven’t even left my room more than to pee in days. I just wake up and watch TikTok & smoke weed and think about getting up and how I just can’t and then at some point I decide I’ll try again tomorrow & spend the entirety of the day and night in bed. 

I no longer think about not being here or feel sad the way I used to. But I also don’t know what to do with my life & a current overwhelming lack of motivation to figure it out. 
My basic pattern of existence is going to work and being a human in the world on those days but the days I am not at work I am a complete shut in. It’s a repetitive cycle that will go on for days, ill do a big deep clean, and then have a good couple of days of being out of the house and active and then boom, back in bed for 2-4 days again. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for exactly, support or advice, I’m not sure. But I know this isn’t normal behavior & I am too embarrassed about this to talk to my friends or family. For all intents and purposes, I am finally “okay” and don’t want to cause worry with my support system because I am struggling doing the basic adult things like keeping a clean apartment and taking my dog out.",1706116227.0,

SellPrior5944,How do I Detach?,3,19e4rlq,1,"I’m a 25 year old female. My parents have always had a very unstable relationship, I have an older sister and younger brother and there have always been arguments in our house, to the extent that there has been a period of several years where my parents lived under the same roof with us but never spoke a word to each other. 

I’m sure my father is a narcissist but he’s the worst kind. He’s educated and very manipulative. My mother and father are a match made in hell. He’s an extreme taker and she’s an extreme giver. For years she’s let him walk all over her and still babied him and catered to his every need. I resent her for that because she NEVER gets anything she wants or needs for her own peace. Even just a clean house. He’s a hoarder and his stuff is filled in a lot of the rooms in our house. He’s selfish and if you tell him something bothers you he will start doing it on purpose. My mother never holds anger and she forgets everything he does to her. She keeps saying she needs to treat him like a mental patient but he’s not because he’s actively making these evil decisions and on top of that claims he’s highly religious when I know Atheists who are much better people than him, in terms of being a good person. My mother, my siblings and I have grown up with this and it’s really affecting me now because I’ve only recently come to these realisations and now I see everything tiny thing wrong and manipulation. I’m the only sibling that still lived at home until now and things keep getting worse. I haven’t spoken to my dad for a year and earlier this year my mum blamed me for something it was later proven I didn’t do, she swore at me for an hour (I said nothing) and then she abandoned me for a months and didn’t speak to me. This year she’s started doing that more and more and I told her I wouldn’t speak to her without therapy because she keeps betraying me then abandoning me for weeks but she is fine with it. She can go weeks without speaking to me and her life goes on as normal but for me that’s all I think about. I can’t concentrate on work or anything else because I’m attached but she’s not. My siblings aren’t like this. It’s gotten to the point where the therapist has told me to get her to write her commitments on paper with a signature so she can be held somewhat accountable. I feel like she is taking the frustrations of her marriage out on me subconsciously. But I feel bad for her because most of the time she doesn’t even know she’s being manipulated by my dad and she realised it when I point it out to her. It’s gotten so bad that all of my family have decided to make me the trauma dump. They hurt me and then when they push me past my limit and finally react they make me the problem. And after a year I’ve finally given them the excuses they need to make me the problem. 

I’m just confused why I don’t want to move out like my other siblings. I’m pathetic and keep worrying about my mum when all she and anyone else ever do for me is performative. Why do I care that my mum is getting older and I want to spend time with her? Why do I have these weird anxieties and start to panic that me leaving home will give my mum more grief and speed her ageing and the next time I see her she won’t look the same? Why have I got abandonment issues and why am I needing her so much why does it hurt me to leave her even though she’ll abuse me even though I’m living under the mercy of them. My GP told me my parents are taking up a lot of the Venn diagram of my life. He used the analogy of Lisa & Homer from the Simpsons saying you need to realise how much someone can give you. I realise that I’ll never have the relationship with my parents that I want but what bothers me is that if they cared they wouldn’t abandon me for months. I wouldn’t do that to my mum. My GP says I need to find myself and live my own life but that won’t make me happy if my mum isn’t happy. I can’t be happy without her.  Family is the one thing that if I had, if I had some stability in my family, I would be happy. I could be unemployed, no money, no friends but if my family was happy then I’d be completely content. I think that’s why God is testing me with this, because he knows it’s a test that will really get to me. Recently things have gotten so bad because i finally reacted. Not only can I not sleep at night from the guilt of my reaction (which wasn’t bad, and my family have done worse), but I have a years worth of resentment towards my family for finally making me the problem. I know I’m in control of my own reactions but I can only take so much repetitive hurtful behaviour that has been discussed endlessly and that I’ve spent months trying to explain in a way that she will understand. But no matter how much factual evidence I have that they and she do not care about me, my mother says that’s all it’s all in my head. Obviously I will think you’re doing it purposefully to hurt me but I still need your validation. She leaves in the middle of our conversations on purpose. I know I’m not supposed to get closure from others but no one is letting me heal. They keep stabbing my open wound. That’s what it feels like. Then they expect me to believe when they say they care when their actions show the opposite and they have successfully made me the issue because I finally have in and reacted. How do I detach? I can’t go into detail but recently an incident occurred and it was turned on me when I was the one who got hurt and asked for help. They both lied and these lies have been recorded forever and that hurts a lot. But I’m pathetic and still want to go back home. I have financial goals and they know this and if I try and go back home they will put conditions on me and blackmail me to even let me enter. I always defend my mum but she betrayed me and teamed up with my dad. But my dad wins either way. He knows if I come home he can and will blackmail me to do things his way and he knows I want to stay home because I have financial goals and if I don’t come home he’s stopping me from getting there. It’s only me that ever loses anything and I’ve lost the most this year, not due to any of my own actions but because of me finally reacting to their hurtful actions. They don’t care how much I lose they still want to see me in pain. Even when my mum admits what she did was hurtful after I question her, she asks me what I want like I’m the issue. Never once does anyone voluntarily apologise or voluntarily say I won’t do that thing that hurt you again. Why do I need them to say this? Why do I need my mum to say this? Why am I not comfortable being misunderstood? How do I detach? Too much context is missing and you might be inclined to say I’m sensitive or need to grow up or take any side but mine but imagine if my parents did something that would affect my life forever and it was not me who caused this but they lied and were believed and it will affect my future but not theirs though they were the abusers. Only I lose. It’s only ever a lose lose for me. Be abused and hurt or leave or distance myself and feel guilty and miserably unhappy. How am I supposed to feel and act? Therapy isn’t helping quick enough. How do I detach?",1706059062.0,

He also said there was nothing electrically wrong with my heart which prompted me to think everything was okay and I’m just experiencing anxiety 

Anyways, since then, I’ve had minimal palps, some flutters, some skipped beats, but once a day at most for about a week.

I started masturbating again because of this, I thought I was okay by what my cardiologist said.

the first few times nothing happened, no symptoms, no palps. did it for abt 4 days straight with this. 

the last time i did it, my heart was pumping hard, and skipped a beat, i stupidly kept going though. once i was finished, again nothing.

i was laying down, feeling sort of anxious?? then i felt a huge flutter, then fast HR after which i never felt before after a flutter.

of course this sent me into a panic, and ive been anxious and having flutters and extra beats since

this prompted me to schedule a stress test friday with my cardiologist since he said to do so if the palps keep happening.

KenRH21,I’m terrified right now,5,19d7e1h,7,"Im absolutely terrified right now. I just got my holter monitor results about a week ago from my cardiologist.

Everything was basically fine expect for a fast heart rate, according to him no electrical abnormalities. He said my palps were only “fast heart rates” and I was basically just “perceiving” them in my head. After the flutter my heart rate was very fast, over 100.

So I went home happy. 

I’ve been engaging in sexual activity for about a week now, the first few times no palps, no weird feelings, nothing. 

After today, about an hour ago, I felt a skipped heart beat in the middle, but we didn’t stop, then when we finished, I felt a flutter as I was laying down. 

I got up to drink some water since I thought I was just dehydrated, and I thought to have felt mini palps, but idk if it was just my anxiety bc I was extremely anxious after the flutter

I’ve been having flutters here and there since the holter monitor appt but I’ve brushed it off bc my doctor said everything was fine.

He called me later that night and said if I keep experiencing palps then I’ll go in for a stress test.

I’m thinking about doing that now.

i started researching cardiac arrest again because im so terrified.

someone please help me, i dont want to go through this again",1705960046.0,

ramner,Life sucks.,2,19cxpif,2,"So almost 2 years ago I attempted suicide and had a really hard time getting myself back on track. But depression was at an all-time low. I started developing anxiety and panic attacks. I ended up taking some time off of work, not really by choice but because of the fact that I couldn't get anything going and I couldn't do anything. I was just in a major slump. I started working in July of last year and it was in the hopes that you know I was feeling better mentally which I thought I was until I was never able to dig myself out of the debt that I created for myself by not working and as of January 15th we were evicted from our home lost it lost my car. Now I am living with my parents paying for a car that I really don't know if I can afford but as of now I can since I'm living at my parents again. But man is it really hard to try to stay positive and find that self-love because of all of this. I find now that I hate myself more than I did almost 2 years ago. I smile and try to keep a positive attitude around. My family joke around a lot but having to take my wife and son to live with my parents house because I fuckes everything up again and again really sucks. Sometimes I wonder why I'm even still here. Life would have been so much better for everybody if I just would have ended it 2 years ago. I had good life insurance for my job that my wife and them would have received would have been close to half a million they would have been able to pay off the debt the car keep the home and live off of that. But once again I fucked everything up and I just hate myself so much for it. I try to tell my wife how I'm feeling but I don't want her to worry. So I act like everything's gravy I go to work. My co-workers think I'm happy and everything is great but in reality I just don't want to be here. On the 29th of February I will turn 40. I will also turn 10 as I'm a leap year baby and they keep thinking to myself. That would be the best time to end everything. And in my stupid brain my reasoning is there's only one day of the year people would have to remember me by. They wouldn't remember the day of my birthday would have been and then have to remember the day that I died. It would all just be rolled up into one tidy package for them so then I wouldn't be on their minds more often. Fuck sometimes life really sucks. Anyway, it's just where my brains at today. I haven't posted in here in a while. I was trying to post positive messages in here to help people and that was just making it worse cuz I was just lying to myself man I just don't know.

We got married when we were 20; I think we were too young. She doesn’t know I have these thoughts about divorce. She thinks everything is fine.

I was on meds for an year two years ago. I came to Canada to do my masters. Initially it was all good but on one day while i was walking on a street, a random stranger was acting weird by coming in and out of my sight alternatively in both sides behind me. I fret and kept an eye on him and suddenly from behind he tried to attack me. I barely dodged it. I ran away quickly to place where many people were there. This incident has triggered me anxiety and panic. I never reported or did anything about this.

Now in my class, there was this girl who always sat infront of me diagonally. I never noticed earlier but she was always making sudden movements, looking back dont know why, this has triggered my anxiety and panic and hypervigilance. My mind would switch to fight or flight kind of mode. Even without my control i would keep tabs on her from corner of my eye. I try not to but my anxiety and panic mind could never be controlled. I think at some point she picked that im looking at her from corner of eye. I feel bad because of fearing what she might think of me. I changed my seating place finally. It was all good but even in my new place, another girl who sat triggered my anxiety due to her sudden movements. Its becoming tough to me, i changed places but i noticed that this girl is also staring at me occasionally and i feel atrociously bad for sending such signals. I never have any kind of feelings or anything like that. Now i suspect or think others are also picking on that i am kind of a creep staring at women etc. I am changing my places and avoided seating near women st all due to this fear but I cant control my anxiety as i always fear due to the aggression attack i faced two months back.

I am trying to get back on my meds and began practising mindfulness. I came to know im suffering from hyperawareness, sensorimeter ocd coupled with anxiety. Due to mindfulness.  Its getting better and i am  changing my places(i plan to stop this). But i hate being perceived as a creep but i guess i cant do anything about it.  I yell to myself that their opinions on me dont matter but i am finding it hard getting out of it. I think im silently suffering.

Swiftie9522,Anxiety flairs or bipolar moment,1,19aav41,0,"(28, F) In short, I’m diagnosed with GAD, PTSD, ADHD, and bipolar. It’s extremely frustrating and causes my moods to fluctuate like no other. I never really get the angry part of it. It usually goes from me getting severe anxiety over stuff that most likely isn’t that big a deal, to 15 minutes later realizing it wasn’t that big of a deal and wondering why I was tripping, to my random bursts of energy and happiness, back to absolutely internally freaking out again and feeling like the world is on my chest crushing it and having a mental breakdown internally because I don’t want anyone to see it. Living alone makes it easier to hide, but at work I feel like I’m dying. It’s exhausting and is starting to kind of show out in my situationship of 2 months (to me at least, I’m pretty good about hiding the nonstop anxiety and over analyzing stupid shit because I don’t want to push him away). Medication just ain’t an option. I was on 6 different meds at one point that were constantly getting switched (I get it takes time to find the right ones, but my god after so many years of it, when will enough be enough?) so I finally just stopped taking them all together a couple years ago. I stopped smoking weed (my only relief) over a month ago as I’m going to start nursing school next year and they do randoms. So just isn’t practical to smoke. But I smoked daily for 12 years and things have been SO MUCH HARDER. I just want to think like a normal person. I can’t stand the constant mood swings, severe anxiety, and the PTSD from childhood and past abusive relationships. It’s made me have an anxious attachment style and I can’t stand it. I work full time on nights at Walmart (my overnight coach is a downright evil “human” so that doesn’t help) and I’m also in college full time with most of my classes in person.

I’ve tried CBT with limited success and I’m now in active 1-to-1 counselling which is helping with developing techniques for when I feel at risk but day to day struggles are very much still there and not budging! 

My counsellor recently suggested that it might be worth having a conversation with my GP about medication (I’ve got family history and she feels we’re getting to the end of what she can do on her own). Spoke to the doctor today and was told (in simple terms) that I’m too young, haven’t been trying for long enough to learn about my own brain and that because I’ve grown up in covid times the real world will now feel very stressful. Then has referred for more CBT. I feel quite shot down as I just went in to discuss with her what options there are, and I was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? Where do I go from here? Am I too young? She made it out that as I hit 25 my anxieties will just magically disappear but I’m slightly doubtful about that.

But it was more of what I didn’t do, rather than it feeling like it had impact on me, things like avoiding phone calls, not talking to anyone, avoiding classes, etc. Lots of overthinking and sleepless nights too. 

But now it’s gotten much worse. I started university, after a year long depression spiral, everything seemed to be going well, until it didn’t. Skipped class here, skipped lecture here, before I knew it I had a lot of material to catch up on. Then I had a month long leave bc of surgery and I went back just in time for all the exams, completely unprepared. 

My resting heart rate is 140bmp on regular basis, I feel nauseous, I constantly have episodes where I just space out for hours overthinking and panicking, I have tension headaches, I can’t sleep and when I do it’s impossible to wake me up for hours, I’m extremely distracted despite taking adhd meds, I have weird symptoms like cold hands and feet, numb feelings too, ringing sounds in my ears. I’m also constantly paranoid my depression will return. 

There’s probably more and it gets worse and worse. I recall sometimes feeling like this, but not to this extent and not for this long (2/3 months slowly accelerating). 

The thing is, I have no idea how to bring it up. With my psychiatrist, I recall specifically answering his questions about anxiety, during our first meeting, saying I don’t have any, as I just couldn’t think of any situations I guess. With my parents I stopped talking about my mental health problems, unless absolutely necessary, as they think I’m doing this to myself (on purpose?) and I’m trying to solve everything with meds. In therapy, I sometimes talk about specific situations, but it’s always solving those small problems resulting from a larger issue, I also seem to always downplay everything when talking about it.

I am a 23 year old 6' 155 pound male with anxiety, ocd and depression that was previously very manageable through therapy alone but a couple months ago exploded in intensity to a debilitating extent and I started having daily panic attacks and feelings of intense doom and despair.  
My doctor prescribed mirtazapine for me to try instead of ssri due to my fear of sexual side effects and also because I had a slightly bad experience with lexapro as a teenager which kind of turned me off towards ssris. Also because the side effects of mirtazapine could actually be beneficial to me since i struggle with sleep and also severely struggle with appetitie.  
I took my first dose of mirtazapine last night (only 7.5 to get my body used to it until i go up higher) and today I actually feel the best ive felt in weeks (still some anxiety and depression but less intense). However my ocd got me to start seeking out negative reviews online and i came across plenty of people saying this drug did nothing for them or made them worse which kind of made me afraid and made me think maybe this drug wont help for anxiety and depression and that I should switch to an ssri immediately.  
Long story short. any success stories would be amazing for me to reassure me to stay the course and give this medication a proper chance before switching. Thank you so much",1705531233.0,

I saw my doctor today to request a medication for my debilitating anxiety with some depressive symptoms. I was expecting him to give lexapro or buspar but instead he prescribed me Mirtazapine and said to follow up with him in 2 weeks...  
Is this a medication that might help with anxiety and depression? I believe the dose he gave was 15mg to be taken at night. I am asking because upon researching it seems to be a sedative which may help with my sleep and appetite issues but it seems unclear weather this would have any affect on my anxiety and depression during the day time like the next day after taking it.  
Can anyone else who is more familiar with this medication please enlighten me? I believe I can get another appointment for thursday to ask for a different med or else I also have an old bottle of zoloft sitting in my cupboard that i never took but am considering starting tonight since i already have the follow up appointment in 2 weeks so i could just tell him i started the zoloft instead of the mirtazapine.

I just had a traumatic experience with my therapist who, for the most part, I like.

I am sorry that I have to be so vague, I just don't feel comfortable going into too much detail: It involved them pushing me to do something (in my life) that is very sensitive and triggering. I tried to explain to them over and over why I don't feel comfortable doing this thing and why I don't feel it is necessary, but they continued to push it.

I did tell my therapist it was triggering during the session. After, I emailed them and told them they crossed the line with me and they apologized. The issue is that I'm paranoid they were trying to make a point or insinuate something negative about me that suggests they don't trust certain things I'm telling them. This is all me making an assumption and based on my own trauma but I feel so uncomfortable with them that I'm not sure about doing another session.

,HIV EXPOSURE. HOW TO MOVE ON?,5,196dnex,3,"2 months ago i had an exposure , this was my first sexual encounter in my life and she is a transwoman sexworker, she gave me a blowjob. I didn't bring a condom with me because i thought it is just a blowjob, but she insist on putting the condom before blowjob. So , she bj me with a condom on. After that , out of nowhere i had this sudden fear of catching HIV from this encounter. I ended up on reddit and google looking for symptoms , hiv tests , stories from other ppl all made my anxiety worse and i decided i need to get a test so post exposure 4 week i did a 4th gen HIV rapid test at home and the result was negative. I was temporarily relieved at that time but when i go back to internet some say 45 days post exposure  4th gen LAB TEST is considered conlcusive. My anxiety got worse waiting for the 6th week and i went to a clinic on post exposure 41th day and did the test , it was again negative. I was relieved and then again my mind was like "" bro you tested on 41th day not 45 "" . I know 4 days difference is not gonna change my result but these voices in my mind asked me to do a test after 45 days. I even asked my Dr if i need to test again , he said the test result wont change and its very unnecessary. Despite listening to the Dr, i still insist on testing and i went on the 50th day post exposure this time,  my Dr was quite annoyed and said dont ever do test again for HIV if this comes out negative and yes he was right , the result i got on the 50th day post exposure was negative too. So i know its conclusive as it is 4th gen blood test from vein and i was happy and relieved, i went on internet and reddit again checking how accurate this tests are and apparently there are some guys out there talking about delayed seroconversion and the need to test again at 3 month post exposure. I read from experts (Dr Hunter and Dr hook) and my personal Dr said delayed seroconversion is a myth and my results are already conlcusive. But still why do i have this fear of contracting HIV even tho i already got my results. I have done 4 tests in total and all of them are 4th gen , every test shows im negative. But still my mind tells me what if the condom has tiny holes that let blood pass thorugh or maybe sexworker used an expired condom and i didnt notice it, what if there was blood from the sexworker's mouth and entered through my bloodstream via the foreskin as i am UNCIRCUMCISED? And even worse , my mind started to doubt my Dr and the lab like what if they didnt run the test properly? Could my Dr being careless about my situation? Isn't he serious enough? . I want to get out from this anxiety , i actually uninstalled reddit, but somehow whenever my mind thinks of possibilities of contracting HIV , i end up again in reddit and google looking for answers and reassurances. So , my question is , are my results already conclusive? Should i again get another test done?

Intelligent-Cry-6597,Anxiety feeling crippling,3,191cmgr,3,"Crippling work and social anxiety #help

33F, and long story short I had a shittt child hood. I don’t like to talk about it because I was told everyone has a story. I grew up in foster care, adopted by a family friend who treated me like crap and was abusive. Ended back in foster care as a kid, bounced around for years and then was out of my own from very young. Have countless post traumatic stress situations I can recall that have caused me such panic and trauma. More to the story but you get the jisp.

My entire life has been fight or flight, I have battled anxiety and depression. More so anxiety in my adult hood. My anxiety has gone through stages but over the past 5-7 years my anxiety has been taken a bad turn every single year getting worse. 

I went from having panic attacks every now and then to having them daily. 

I managed to go to college, get a degree, work my way up in corporate. Make a great living for Myself, have a husband and a dog and a beautiful home and life together.

But my anxiety has gotten to a point for me that it feels crippling. I have constant worry about the future as in minor things, worried about a meeting I have at work, what will people think when I say something, did I say something wrong, I go over a conversation or an email over and over again for weeks upon weeks it’s sickening. Constantly worrying about how I came Off, if I sounded stupid.

I have a hard time paying attention, often frantic about these things all day that I started to make mistakes in work over the last few years and some of these mistakes still haunt me. I’m constantly second guessing every little tiny thing I do for work. This goes on socially as well, with people that are acquaintances, or my in law family.

 I cut back on drinking to barely nothing I mean like once or twice a year because the anxiety is so bad afterword I found it not to be worth it to drink. 

My work anxiety though is by far the worst. I 100% battle with imposter syndrome. And part of it is I can remember things people have said that have made me feel stupid over the years. That of course traces back to my insecurities from childhood of always feeling like I wasn’t smart, kids made fun of me in school because I never knew the answer when I got called on. But in school I was worrying about having a place to live and not school. 

Then in work I can recall times of people making me feel stupid for not knowing something. Something that doesn’t even pertain to work. One guy asked me years ago, do I  know what IQ stood for? I said no I don’t actually. Then he put me down for not knowing this and laughed at me. This was at work. I asked my friend who I think is one of the smart people in my life if she knew what it stood for and she didn’t. But things like this live on with me forever. Like I said probably traced back to my childhood. I go over situations like this in my head countless times. My confidence is in the drain, it causes me panics throughout my day, and some days I feel crippled in bed or hard to start my day because I’m constantly worried that I’m not cut out for work.

I have been in therapy for years. I just moved and have the opportunity to try a different type of therapy for anxiety called EMDR and hoping that helps. 

Idk I’m looking for advice, anything. Anyone else experience this? Anyone else actually overcome anxiety? I have googled so many things to help, read other stories, read books, tried therapy and countless medications. I feel stuck and sometimes feel like this can’t be it. There has to be something that can really help. Atleast I hope so. #hell",1704688592.0,

SquintyPines,Overwhelmed + Discouraged,1,190mkx5,2,"My husband and I just moved to a small city for his career (Police Officer). It's his dream job in our ideal home, unfortunately I haven't been able to shake this sense of shame I have about my future and my job. For context, I'm a 31yo female, with a Bachelor's in Graphic Design. I have done **everything** under the sun: bartender/barista, studio manager/producer, adjunct instructor at a state university, product design and development assistant for Kroger/TJX/Home Depot/Wayfair, freelance graphic designer, taught English overseas, a Champions site director, a Rover dog-walker, and now... a retail worker who teaches Hiit classes part time.

I feel so much shame, anger, and depression towards my future and the ""loss of potential,"" I feel like I've become. I once was so motivated to seize opportunities and apply my creative tenacity to any position I held - I even made time for extensive volunteer work, but from 2020 until 2022 I've been unemployed twice and it brought everything to a halt. I was affected by Covid and company reorganization as well as poor financial decisions by a start-up.  It really extinguished my hopes and I haven't been able to shake that anxiety of finding a steady job since - let alone GET a decent job.

I was always one who self-initiated projects, took great ownership of my responsibilities, strived for leadership opportunities, and truly did my best to support the team as a whole. I've been told I'm incredibly gifted as a saleswoman and communicator, as well as someone who can be thrown any role and succeed in it. I even got REAL close to a a fantastic job I thought would be a solid combination of my varied experiences, but then the hiring manager told me they hired her friend and changed the role to ""better suit her experience,"" but she ""truly recognized my value and the strengths I'd bring to any company."" I believed her, but... woof.

So now I feel STUCK and I am really scared that I won't have anything to retire with, I'll always have to struggle between two jobs, and fully rely on my husband's income for our larger bills.

It's only become more difficult to believe in myself and look at job boards without having a full panic attack. I'm working 35hrs as a retail worker in a town where I feel like I'm constantly seen as an uneducated, incapable loser, and waste of space.

I realize my own perception of how employment = value is harboring my experience, but I feel **hopeless**. And now I've found myself - almost weekly, curling up into a ball, crying my eyes out because, ""What's the point of working so hard, learning anything new, being educated, being told, 'You're SO smart/You're such a GREAT problem solver/You're SO gifted!' just to feel like you're a waste of experiences and brain space. I just feel WORTHLESS and PATHETIC. I wish people would stop telling me, ""You're too smart to be a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ forever. You're going to find that role!"" It's just not looking great from where I'm laying down...in a mud pit of self pity and bitterness. 

Please don't come after me if I offended you. I'm just venting my pain and I realize how insensitive and  ridiculous I sound, but hopefully someone can resonate or offer some...encouragement?",1704611832.0,

Evilbatboypro,I think anxiety ruined me,1,18zwjbq,0,"

The last more than half a year I’ve been dealing with these unique symptoms and I thought my life was js starting I’m 15 years old I js turned 15 in November and I feel like I’m too young to be feeling like this so when I was 14 and I could do everything I want basically I didn’t feel depressed had anxiety anything I felt js fine. But then I tried weed and vaping and dabs for a couple months and the weed had a good feeling and I would do it everyday if I had a chance. I had my first panic attack when I was high at the park with my friends they was passing around a blunt and a joint and I took so many hits off of that and then I felt paranoid so I called my mom and when she picked me up I was freaking out in the car my face was pale it looked like I had eyebags and my heart was racing I thought I was gonna die… but when it wore off I felt fine so I kept doing weed. But even since then it didn’t feel the same and everytime I would try it my heart would beat irregular one time i was tryna smoke after that event happened and I was feeling my chest and I didn’t feel my heart beating and I felt weird so I stood up and I was panicking so bad I thought I was also gonna die. And I had one more bad panic attack I hit a disposal ik it’s stupid after that happened but I did and ofc I had another panic attack everything around me was spinning and my mom say me in the cold shower so my heart would stop beating hard and I was so shaky. I stop doing weed after this it was to much after that. But after that all that I noticed that I was lightheaded and I couldn’t help rlly do yard work and my mind js felt blurry and out of no where my heart would race I told my mother abt this and he took me to the hospital it turned out I was really dehydrated my pee was brown but I got iv fluids and sat there and after that I felt like my normal self a little bit… I wasn’t focusing on my heart as much cuz I felt better and I felt good enough my friend peer pressured me into try weed again and I did “worst thing I did” I only hit 4 hits off this joint and my tolerance was really low and instantly everything was into slow motion and my heart was racing and I couldn’t think I was walking around my house like a freak because I didn’t know what to do and I couldn’t think. But nothing major happened I js went inside my house and I sat till it wore off I was js feeling my heart. After that again I didn’t rlly try again until the end of summer my mom sent me to my uncles 3 hours away from everyone that I know and I couldn’t see my gf or anything so I was real sad at the time and bored so I would try weed again because my uncle had some I would take little hits here and there nothing much I didn’t freak out rlly but I js decided to actually stop this time because it wasn’t doing anything. And all of the sudden sitting in my room when I was Sobor my brain/head would js feel weird it’s hard to explain it my mind would js go into panic or I felt like something real bad is gonna happen and I would freak out so bad so I would run down

To my uncles and tell him but he said I was fine and it would happen even when I was with him and I never experienced derelization before until that moment and I still experience it. And I would have many of these episodes when I was with my uncle it got so bad I seen the lower of my neck throbbing because my pulse was so fast.. I would develop these weird symptoms that think I was abt to die or I’m dying like panicking when I stood up and randomly panicking. This is also where I developed cardiohopa where I thought abt everything a matter with my heart I would search things up on google thinking bad things. After all this I js felt like nothing seems as real everything I look at is js numbing and I can’t even think sometimes I js focus on my heart rate and breathing and it freaks me out.

To save my life I feel like my mind is js empty and I’m js spectating and talking through my body when I’m with people I will look at them and I can’t think what to say or what they say it js doesn’t seem real. and my mood has been down ever since. I can’t even walk anywhere anymore without thinking I might js collapse on the floor or I have a panic attack and it will feel like I’ll stop breathing but I think this happens because I feel like I’m not fully there so I go into panic because I feel like I’m not real and outside my body. And I’ll have to stop and look at my hands and the ground like if I’m even alive. Things gotten so bad out of no where I created a note 2 months ago explaining all my symptoms. And I’m always so mean. And Also I recently discovered that I have a condition called CholinergicUrticaria that came out of no where it’s where my body breaks out in severe pain when I get hot or exercise. It goes away if I put cold water on me or go into a cold area but it only makes the systoles go away for a little bit. I still feel like little bugs are biting me even though when I’m cold.  I still feel like little bugs are biting me even though when I’m cold.

To everyone now… 
And btw I’ve been too doctors and they have said I’m js fine I’ve been checked out 5 times at 5 different places and they said I am fine. They js gave me anxiety medication but this feels like more than anxiety. Is this all js mental? It won’t ever go away. Will I break out of this cycle I want my old life back. I feel like no body compares to me.. or thinks like me I js wanna be normal is this apart of growing up am I js weak?.. it seems like I’m venting my whole life on here but I have no one that relates to me and they js tell me I’m fine",1704534271.0,

For a while now I haven’t been able to really enjoy any activities or hobbies, it’s been hard to enjoy what I like about them, and so easy to see (or manufacture) negative things about them.

I’ve let my social network really deteriorate, especially over the last 2 years. I didn’t have close friends to begin with, but I moved far away from home and family with my girlfriend to a place that I really wanted to try living in and advance my career. I have not made a single friend in this new place. I almost never call or text my family, even though I have good relationships with everyone. I do fly out twice a year to visit which feels nice, but no one has come up to visit me even a single time, and deep down it has really bothered me.

I’m currently in the process of getting dumped by my girlfriend, who I’ve been in a relationship with for five years. We were supposed to get married, this shit sucks, and a lot of it is my fault. Two huge issues for all of our relationship have been her struggles with alcoholism, and my inability to handle problems in healthy ways. I’ve always been so quick to criticize her for small things, or question our relationship or suggest to break up at any setback that we’ve ever had, such as some of her drinking episodes. We might not be compatible as a couple due to her drinking habits (she doesn’t want to stop drinking despite acknowledging having a problem), but I regret how bad I’ve treated her in the past, especially for the last year.

I've been diagnosed with GAD at 16 y/o and have been in therapy consistently, and on medication on and off since.

I like the routines, but even the smallest of tasks is daunting. The moment I get a message, I immediately have to run to my work laptop and take action no matter what time of day or night. I get very scared if there is silence or no activity and log in even out of my work hours and the weekends just out of the fear that I'm probably missing some task that I'm supposed to do. The timelines are quite tight and I feel like I'm going to mess up no matter what. I can see that my teammates are sick of having to reassure me that I'm doing a good job, even after interning and working there for about an year now. I'm worried I am not fit for any job at all, no matter the field and pay. If I can't feel good here, where I have a good team and decent benefits, then what chance do I have anywhere else? These last two weeks of winter break, I've just distracted myself every second without having time to think at all and now that I have to get back to work I've started having anxiety attacks just thinking about all that I might have missed. And added to that, I just can never relax. I broke down during the short vacation I had taken, just because I felt that I was definitely neglecting what I'm supposed to do and being irresponsible. Sometimes when I mess up, I'm scared that they'll keep me on and I'll keep letting them down, rather than that they'd fire me. I really don't see any job that I'm fit for, as even the smallest of tasks sends me into a spiral. 

Is it so bad to be wasted potential? I'm fine with leading a very below average life as I've never really had any ambitions, except to one day wake up and not feel like pulling out my skin.

One specific point to mention, she has no children as she and her husband faced infertility issues. 

A few months back my husband and I announce to close family and friends we were expecting our first baby. However after experiencing severe HG and a dramatic uptick in my anxiety, we made the painful decision to terminate (one I will always question). His aunt was over the moon when we announced and it became another area where we bonded as she was excited to be so close to a new baby in the family. Once my husband and I made our decision, she was visibly upset (understandably given her past experience) and I believe it’s permanently altered our relationship even thought we have since gotten back to our “normal” habits/activities.

Here’s where the selfishness and jealousy comes into play: her niece on her husband’s side of the family is pregnant. I see all the joy and excitement about this that it kills a bit of me inside. While I’m happy for her niece, all I can think about is all the bonding/time I’ll be missing out on due to the decision I made. Things won’t be the same again as she’ll be playing a major role in this baby’s life as an aunt and caregiver during working hours. It feels like I’m grieving the future I saw for myself with the person I now consider as a “mother”. 

I’m trying not to be bitter and stay up beat and positive but on the inside I want to crawl into bed and cry for a lifetime. Therapy and meds have done wonders to help calm much of the anxiety I have experienced due to these past few months traumas. However, being in a new state, I have no friends around. It’s a small town and I feel so isolated. Without the company I found in my husband’s aunt (which I trueley hope continues) I feel like a prisoner to the four walls of our apartment due to my bad social anxiety…. 

I just want things to go back to the way they were…. 

But I realize how selfish and cruel this makes me.",1704348411.0,
pro_dissapointment,Does anyone also loose their mind after a particularly long and bad episode?,2,18y1ns6,2,"So I've felt this many times but I always thought that it was a fluke, but now I'm not so sure. When I have a particularly long episode of depression and anxiety (2 to 3 days of feeling like absolute shit, much worse than the general omnipresent dread), sometimes when I snap out of it, I feel like I'm loosing my mind. Like my surroundings start feeling like they don't exist, like I'm delusional or something. I know it sounds weird but I don't know how else to express what I'm feeling. Everything starts feeling absurd. It gets to a point at which I start questioning my existence and the existence of the world. It's like I suddenly become super aware of my surroundings. This only leads to more anxiety. Does anyone else also experience this? Am I the only one who is losing his mind?

Capital_Carry6013,Is this normal?,2,18xzigy,6,"I used to be extremely close friends with a girl at my school. We met about two years ago and got along very well from the beginning. We knew absolutely everything about each other and we were inseparable to the point that we seemed like brother and sister. Eventually we began to be even more open with each other and we began to discuss our mental health and sexuality. I had shared with her that I had had sh'd and she was extremely supportive.

We had a falling out with each other and slowly began to drift apart. I was desperate to get close again but she refused and said that I was playing with her emotions, only to act like my friend later and agree to be my friend again. Because of my anxiety I had cut off all communication with all of my friends over the six week holiday. When school started again, she seemed fine with me and we was still close. 

I had tried to text and speak to her multiple times but she always said that she had exams as a way to avoid me. Eventually I couldn't keep it in anymore and told my school about my sh. They had asked me if any of my friends knew and I told them. They spoke to the girl about it and it made her extremely uncomfortable, but they didn't tell her that I was the reason. I sent her a text letting her know that I was the reason that they spoke to her and apologised to her. I asked her to respond if she wanted to be friends again, but she didn't respond.

There’s no such thing as being behind in life or being behind in society…the only things along those lines that are real are social constructs, societal bias and comformity, generational trauma, closed-mindedness, desperation for validation from other people, the illusion of superiority in the form of unnecessary, unwanted, and unasked for judgement, the fear the government specifically designs to control the people to get more money and power, peer pressure, and unhealthy perfectionism. Don’t be a sheep, allow yourself to be a unique, beautifully imperfect human…life has no set schedule or manual, so stop comparing yourself to others. Don’t be afraid to be different or go against the societal/social norm. Learn to be okay with being controversial, and unlearn society’s unrealistic standards. You’re uniquely you. It’s not your job to keep everyone else happy. However it is your job to keep your peace and to do what’s best for your life, your plans, and your mental health…even if it upsets people. You’re worth it. Stop caring about what other people think of you and other people’s opinions…they’re just that, opinions. It’s time to stop fearing other people, they’re only human, just like you, with their own flaws and challenges and personal hells to go through. If something doesn’t affect you, just shut up about it and don’t butt into other people’s business. It’s not your life, it’s theirs, and you’re not them. And to incorrectly assume you know exactly what someone might be going through or what it’ll take to cut them into one of society’s boring, sheep, conformist cookies, is just so wrong and sad and pathetic on so many levels. Again, you’re not them, you’re not in their mind, you’re not in their situation, so shut up about things you know nothing about, doesn’t matter if they’re friends or family. It’ll just make things worse if you judge and assume. And things you say literally have the ability to stick with people and rewire their brains and change their brain chemistry, so don’t be the reason people start thinking that they’re not enough or even the reason they start considering unaliving themself. Be the opposite. Perfection doesn’t and will never exist, no matter what society says. Fuck society and their unrealistic, engineered standards. Don’t add to society’s toxicity, half of them don’t deserve the time of day. Your imperfections are beautiful. Additonally, always try to spread love, positivity, understanding, unconditional support, and empathy wherever and whenever you can, you never know what someone else might be going through and you could even be the person to restore their faith in humanity 💖

I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself too, even for the baby steps. Some progress is better than no progress at all, ignore the haters and don’t let them put you back to square one…and don’t let them make you even think that you’re back at square one when they’re not you and don’t have your mind or your experiences, it’s not their life, and they have no right to judge your progress, especially when I know half of your progress most people are too blind to see…I see your progress, and you’re doing absolutely amazing 😊

On December 8 I went out with some friends and got blackout drunk. The hangover was awful and my panic attacks had come back. I mean terrible hour long panic attacks. All the symptoms. Throwing up, heart racing, sweating, dizzy, numb hands. It’s happened about daily since then. The past week or so it’s felt like I’ve been in one big panic attack nonstop.

There is so much exaggerated emphasis on being happy and creating new goals around this time and for me this only makes my depression and anxiety worse.
Today I told myself to first of all breathe. These man made inventions about new year resolutions and jolly Christmas times - they are building people up to fail. If you ruin the resolution or you’re not happy enough it only makes you miserable. Nature is already testing our strengths with the short, dark days and cold weather. We don’t need a reason to sink lower. So I have told myself not to overwhelm myself with unrealistic expectations. Yes it is now 2024 on our calendars but in reality it is one day after yesterday and therefore there is no necessity to feel anxious that you need to be improving as a human being or reaching any goals right now. Take care of yourself in whatever way works for you - for me it is carrying on with my usual routine, treating this day as I would any other, treating myself with patience and kindness. It is good to have goals but not the kind New Year’s resolutions ask you to invent. Take your time there are 365 days to have good, bad and in between days. We will reach some goals, fail others and come up with some new ones along the way which we’d never even considered before. There is no need to overwhelm yourself.

When I was 14 it started with a panic disorder, that lasted 5-10 years and now I suffer from GAD where I’m just always anxious. I did have a bad bout of Derealization for over a year straight in my early 20’s, I’m 33 now. I wonder if anyone shares the same symptoms I do, every day. It’s driving me nuts. 

I have had every medical test known to man and everything has come back clean. I have a PCP, Neurologist, Pulmonologist, Cardiologist, Rheumatologist, Ophthalmologist.  

My only diagnosis’s are:
POTS
GAD
OCD
DEPRESSION 

Symptoms: 

1. Chronic fatigue (regardless of how much sleep I get) absolute constant exhaustion. When I wake up, I’m only thinking about going back to sleep. 

2. Brain fog. I have to focus really hard in order to concentrate, especially at work. I have an inability to multitask, so if my husband is talking to me, and I’m reading something on my phone, I am unable to grasp what he is saying. When I am focused on a conversation I often feel really slow in my responses because I feel like it takes me longer to process and understand what someone has said to me. I feel dumb. Feeling like I’m in a dream like state. 

3. Light sensitivity when I go outside or into a store. It doesn’t necessarily “hurt” but it’s uncomfortable and makes me squint. I always wear sunglasses and it helps some. I feel like I can never comfortably open my eyes all the way outside or in a store. 

4. Inability to focus my eyes far away. When I go out for a walk, unless I’m looking at my phone or an object that is near me, my eyes have a hard time focusing on things in the distance. Perhaps it’s overstimulation? I also have this in stores. I have had my eyes checked so many times and everything comes back fine. It’s not necessarily blurry or staticky, more so like I have to squint my eyes to focus them (which really doesn’t do much because nothing is technically “out of focus”.) 

5. Either over eating or under eating. 

6. Feeling like I’m on an elevator, like the “drop” feeling. 

7. Not feeling lightheaded or dizzy but just feeling overall “off balance” I call it lightheaded or dizzy but it’s not necessarily that. 

8. Feeling like I’m shaky, like I haven’t eaten in a long time and my blood sugar is low however when I look at my hands/legs I’m never visibly shaking? 

These symptoms range in severity but I never go without chronic fatigue, brain fog or the vision symptoms. Those are 24/7.

twdliv,What’s the point,1,18v0m46,0,"The past few months have been so hard. Summer was great I felt healthy and happy and although there was a few bumps I felt like I was in the right head space to deal with them. The minute I started my second year at uni in September everything just seemed to go to shit. But all because of me and my mind. 

For years every now and then I’d experience “depressive” episodes. Which I usually like to reject as I don’t want to be like my mum.

This term at uni was especially bad as I got sick and needed antibiotics, then I started suffering from rly bad tooth ache so I then found out I had an infected tooth which needed a root canal or full removal. Then lectures started and that meant leaving the house and spending money, doing uni work, doing work for my dad, socialising, being placed in this new environment which I thought I understood but I really don’t. Second year was meant to be better. On top of this my childhood best friend started to distance himself from me but he is such an important person to me even if we don’t talk as much as we used to. 

I started getting anxious about leaving my house, started thinking that everybody cares about how I look, what I’m doing, what I say. I kind of thought like this previously but this was bad. This was to the point where I wasn’t leaving my room and that’s not normally like me, I usually go for walks and go the gym and spend time with my friends and laugh a lot with the occasional episode of sadness here and there but my friends were always there to support me. Especially him. 

Out of no where I just got suicidal. What’s the point of living is constantly on my mind. I hate uni I hate myself I hate everything. I was never perfectly happy but I still wanted to live and love and enjoy life but now I see no happy outcome for anything no motivation. Everything I want to attempt at being happy my thoughts just become dark again. I’m the oldest of three and I feel like I looked after them while my mum wasn’t well and I never really felt what I need to feel frowning up and I feel like it’s all hit me now, how can I only be 20 and feel so much pain and sadness. 

The depression I’ve experienced has never been this bad and I’ve felt like I’m stuck in this hole for so long, it’s been 2 months now of suffering everyday and the reason why I’m still alive is because I know I couldn’t do that to my family and my friends because they love me I know but I just don’t feel like I fit or matter enough. 

I hate this feeling of being out of control and feeling constantly sick. I feel so stuck.

,Hello,3,18unfvy,3,"Hi 

I just want to vent.

So as far as I can remember I have always been a worrier, however I never thought i had anxiety or anything like that. I remember as a teenager watching those YouTubers with anxiety and thinking how dramatic they were.

Since I’ve gotten married (8 years ago) I noticed my mental health declining. I am obsessive in my thoughts… Not over one particular thing but several things.

For instance in the past four weeks, I have obsessed over having bed bugs, obsessive that my house will suffer subsidence and no one will ever insure me again or ever help me fix the house, convincing myself that my son has autism or adhd. Convinced myself if I put him into nursery they will say he has some sort of problem and is developmentally behind. 

I will constantly look for clues to back up these obsessions. Stare at bricks for subsidence, constantly call my sons name to see if he respond and could have autism, constantly check my bed for bedbugs, worry about every spot my son gets convincing myself it’s bed bugs. 

I was obsessive when pregnant thinking my baby would have a genetic condition, he would be born stillborn, I’d get toxoplasmosis because I ate a medium steak. 

I obsess that my son has autism, adhd, that he had cerebral palsy. What if he grows up to be a drug dealer or a child that doesn’t listen. 

I just can’t stop. What hurts for me is I am known to be this happy person. I’ve even had people tell me I make it seem like I have no problems. I’m sick of pretending to be happy. So sick. I can function day to day but I can’t wait for the moment to get into bed and obsessively google things. Google is a massive problem for me. I’m just glad I didn’t have a phone growing up as I feel like my thoughts would have ruined my childhood. 

I just don’t know what to do. My husband knows I am anxious and tells me I worry to much. He is very supportive. I don’t tell my family because I don’t want to worry them. At my in laws I put on this brave front 

Im so tired. I am lucky in the sense that I don’t have thoughts about hurting myself as I’m too scared but I do sometimes wonder if my family would be better off without me, whether they’d be happier. 

Thanks",1703964360.0,
SadCranberry7010,When Anxiety is your life...,1,18uv2od,3,"I am anxious all the time.

I have a toxic boss that bends the laws to suit them. My husband is a narcissist that constantly continues to talk down to me and our children. My oldest son (16) is refusing school, his meds, and won't lift a finger in this house.

I have met my soul sister this year. Both of us are so worried we are going to hurt the others feelings, that we end our evenings saying we aren't mad at each other.

My boss - I over compensate at my job to avoid them being angry with me. I am always one step ahead of them to avoid their wrath. I am not being paid enough to put up with this, but the job itself is so rewarding. It is my boss. Every time I have an issue and I vent to my sister or bff, I fear that my boss knows or is somehow going to find out. Plus, every day I go to work, I have stress/anxiety induced vomiting. (I can not talk to a higher up about this, there is no higher up at my work that isn't scared of my boss)

My sister-in-law, an over achiever, has said to me that being in a part time minimum wage job is not stressful, and that I should be able to take care of my family, do my job, and suck it up. As in, you have nothing to be stressed about. 

My son has been refusing school for over a decade. I have gone through hoops to get him help, but he doesn't want it. My husband thinks this is all my fault. 

My doctor wants me to take stress leave, but the boss says I can't. My husband thinks that I do nothing at my job and shouldn't complain as his job is much more important then mine. 

If I quit my job and try self-care, my husband will tell me we are going broke and I need to make sure the kids are going to school, make every meal, clean the house, find a better paying job, and run all errands. Mom's never get a sick day.

All of this, combined with a health scare, that luckily was not serious, I can not relax at all. Ever. I am on call for my family all the time. Every time my phone makes a noise, I flinch. Is it work? Is it my kids? Is it the school?

I actually don't know what I want from posting this. Living like this is exhausting, but I have no choice, my kids need me. My husband guilts me into doing all the things, despite needing a break. No one else will do it. As it is not ""his"" problem, he doesn't understand it. He sees in black and white. A side note, I did not need anti-depressants until I lived with him for a few years.

Hello! I hope I will make sense. So the last couple of months were pretty bad for me: a breakup, moving (that I didn’t want) and some minor stuff, and I have been constantly on edge. I buried the pain of the breakup, and I feel like I couldn’t really process the other feelings either. I said some stuff that I deeply regret now, and overall I was just really insufferable. 
A few days ago I was supposed to travel abroad, but I got this constant feeling that I was gonna die. On the day of the travel I signed for a new job, and on the way home I kept feeling this certainty that I couldn’t escape and saw some signs (a funeral car and other de@th related stuff), so after all I cancelled the trip. But I didn’t achieve the calmness I wanted, after the decision I started to feel that this decision was the one that would get me dead. And I tried feeling positive about my new job, and imagined how nice it was gonna be, but suddenly I got the feeling that I wasn’t gonna enjoy it for long. And today I woke up and got the exact same feeling about the route to work that I got about traveling. So what if the feeling that I was gonna die wasn’t really about the trip, but about the new workplace???
So my question is could not feeling and releasing the sorrow of the breakup , the guilt of not treating my loved ones well and feeling lost in life manifest in death anxiety?",1703949697.0,

olilixoxo,Need advice on treatment,1,18u5ttx,0,"Hello everyone! ☺️

I am now 26 years old and since almost 10 years i have been suffering from anxiety and « depression »; the depression is not officially diagnosed but my doctor think this is likely the case. 

At the begginning, i would think between 16-23, i was still young and i didnt know what was wrong with me and i tought that it was maybe normal to feel like this. I was always stressed since very young but that was it; no other condition then feeling anxious. But then i started feeling bad, like depressed all the time, not capable of enjoying anything. Despite this, i finished my 3 years of college and my 5 years of university. I had this feeling that if i gave in and let go, i would only worsened my condition and stay put at home. 

Near the end of my master, i started talking about it to my friends and family; then to my doctor who had changed between the lines. He took my condition very seriously and has been helping me since then. In 2021, i had my first anxiety attack, so we are trying to help me and treat me for this too. 

For medication, i had been taking mirtazarpine and buproprion for the first treatment (not much effect) but when i started having anxiety attack, my doctor added venlafaxine and it really helped me in the begginning. I was not 100% good, but i was feeling better than ever in a long time. But then, i had the feeling that it stopped working as good has it was, and my doctor increased the dose. I honestly dont think it changed anything.

Last week, he sent me to a psychiatrist to have my case evaluated. She is supposed to send recommendations for a new treatment. I am hopeful for this, though i have a feeling she was minimizing my condition (saying that sometimes nothing works and we have to live with this…)

I am sorry for this long message, but i just really nees someone to tell me that everything will be ok and that i will not have to live with this sadness all my life pretending i feel ok. I am not suicidal; not ever. But i am tired of feeling depressed, like nothing matters and that all looks gray and with no hope. I really hope i will find treatment to help me feel like myself again.

Then, I wake up feeling really anxious and wired...aware of every single bodily sensation. I can feel the anxiety building and so I run and take my meds.

Then, I go through this body-checking ritual where I get under the light and check almost every part of me for something wrong. I always make sure to take my temp and BP too and often, repeat this whole ritual several times each day. It's maddening really.

A rash must mean cancer. A hemorrhoid must mean I have a raging infection. My stomach gurgles so that must mean that I have stomach cancer. I over-think, ruminate, obsess, catastrophize and spend hours on the ""what- ifs"".

The worst of all of this is when I've just gotten up in the mornings. The anxiety goes through me like electricity. Once I've had my coffee, taken my meds, gotten some chores done and woken up a little, I seem to be about 60% better but it's still there on some level.

I have found that on ""do nothing days"" where I'm just sitting around with nothing to do, it is really bad because thats when the dark thoughts start to creep in.

It's about my battle with PTSD, depression and anxiety a battle that's probably familiar to many of you. Imagine living in a world where everything feels muted, where every day is like trying to swim through molasses.

But this isn't just a tale of struggle. It's also about a tiny, almost missed, turning point. One of those late-night internet sessions, you know, where you're just looking for something to break the monotony of your thoughts, led me to something unexpected. It was the lma course that some of you mentioned in here by a guy called Tim Han / Success Insider – I won't go into specifics, but it was about emotional management and resilience. Kind of like a little nudge in a different direction.

What struck me the most were the stories of people just like us in here. They weren't sugarcoated or prettied up. They were raw, real, and resonated with me on a level I didn't expect. It was like finding a community within the solitude of my own room.

This wasn't a quick fix. Far from it. It was more like finding a flashlight in a dark room. It didn't light up the whole space, but it gave me enough light to start navigating. I began to understand the power of small actions, like journaling. Writing down my thoughts and fears made them tangible, something I could see and, more importantly, something I could face.

Slowly, ever so slowly, the world started to regain some color. I began to notice little things – the warmth of a cup of tea, the quiet peace of early mornings, the sound of rain against my window. Small joys, maybe, but in the depths of depression, they felt like lifelines.

It's not like everything is sunshine and rainbows now. There are still days when the shadows feel overwhelming. But now, those days are interspersed with moments of genuine happiness and a feeling that maybe, just maybe, things can get better.

I'm sharing this because I know some of you are where I was, feeling like you're stuck in an endless night. I want to tell you that it's okay to feel lost, it's okay to struggle, and it's okay to need help. There's no shame in that. And yes, there's hope, sometimes in places you least expect it.

To everyone reading this, keep fighting. Your story isn't finished yet. There's a path out of the darkness, even if it's just one step at a time. And remember, you're not walking that path alone.",1703578827.0,

Many people are facing anxiety and depression. Some are on medications. Some are seeing therapists, listening to podcasts, watching videos etc.

My niece lives with me however I allowed her to stay with her parent for the holiday. I went to visit today and left, while on my way home I get a video call from my niece who was upset. I eventually asked my sibling to sing the song from a movie I know will help calm her. I get called manipulative and disrespectful. 

I told them I don’t sing the lyrics because I don’t remember them but I do hum the beat. I get told that’s manipulation.

veryberryblue,Anyone else ever go through something similar?...really wierd!,2,18qp4jv,0,"Just before I woke up, I was having a dream about being attacked by a wild Zebra (of all things!). It had my ankle in it's mouth and was trying to drag me away and it had a very firm grip on me.

The dream ended and while I was still asleep (or maybe half-asleep) I had this sensation that my brain...or head was shaking/jerking but I don't actually know if I was dreaming or if I was having the kind of shakes a person has when they have myclonic jerks and thier arm or leg suddenly jumps up in the air while they are sleeping. Anyway, it freaked me out and my anxiety started acting up and so I finally just got up.

I took my meds, had coffee, unwrapped a few gifts and worked up a little sweat doing everything. Sat down, took my temp and it was 99 degrees. My BP/pulse was a little high too so I started to get anxious again.

About 20 minutes later and a few more presents, I noticed a rash on my right arm, a rash on my right forearm and a rash on my left forearm. I freaked out and my anxiety went through the roof!.

An hour later, I've calmed down a little bit, my temp is 98.8, my BP/pulse has come down some and the rash has almost completely disappeared but my anxiety/panic attack and racing mind has left me feeling very tired. Anyway, that was my day so far. Anyone else here ever have a similar experience?.",1703532214.0,
FreddyIncognito,“tense and release”,6,18qhcu8,3,"I thought I’d share a tip from an anti-anxiety app that I belong to because it has helped:  if you are having a panic attack a technique to force your body to relax is “Tense and Release”. Sit straight up and  clasp your hands under your chin, creating a tripod form with your arms. Tense ALL the muscles in your body as hard as you can and make the largest most obnoxious smile you can to tense your face up.  Hold this pose for 30 seconds and then “release” the tension slowly while exhaling and calmly saying “release “.  The forced tension can override some of the physical tension from panic attacks and force a relaxation response to the body when you consciously “release” your muscles.  I lean on this during massive panic attacks, but apparently if you practice this often and discipline yourself with the exercise you can train your body over time to calm down with the JUST trigger word “release” on its own.",1703505570.0,
,I'm struggling with various issues with health anxiety health issues etc,3,18qjkt3,5,"I'm so fucking done with life and I don't see the point anymore.

I've probably made some decisions lately which may have been not really the best. 

However it's so difficult when you're dealing with circumstances that cause to stress so much and feel so depressed and anxious.

I was previously diagnosed with ADHD and ASD. It just doesn't feel like it sticks whatsoever. Last time I saw the psychiatrist I tried to make it well clear that stimulants do not help me. Infact what they did is they ended up exxcaebating my manic behaviour and this lead to some extremely impulsive decision making and this has effected my health :(

I tried out diluted bleach baths to try and attempt to actually help an issue with my ezcema. I'm so sad now. I feel like somehow my mind is not the same, I'm scared. I feel like this bleach exposure has caused some sort of cognitive impairment and it feels like my reading comprehension level has reduced:/ I can't just scan read stuff anymore honestly I find it difficult. Not only that my breathing was potentially effected by it all and I deal with this shortness of breath and I feel like sometimes I have shortness of breath.

I really tried to explain the issues with my concentration to the psychiatrist they're not based on attentive matters. yes I feel so restless but I feel like this is an over simplicition of the matters at hand.

I have always felt happiness when I've been on that emotional high. It used to be running and I used to get an absolute sense of feeling invincible from it and it was amazing. I am now in a constant depression as it seems with suicidal thoughts. I've been trying microdosing recently and I must emphasis my only reason for mentioning it is that  well I don't know if it was a good idea. 

I'm really not sure I have bipolar but I am seeing a psychiatrist in march and I feel like I am missing something tbh.

I wasn't previously honest with my psychiatrist as well I was under alot of pressure from my new job at the time, I had to pass a fitness check. It was too much and I stopped taking the medication at one point it just wasn't good for me. Even though I felt like I was being gaslighted to believing that I wasn't dealing with any side effects of the ADHD medication.

It's like I feel like when I received the initial ADHD diagnosis it was like a whirlwind at the time and it just felt like it was tagged on following the ASD diagnosis honestly.

Since I haven't been able to run I've seriously struggled with my sense of self even more. Even to the point of thinking I am trans. I don't know. It's like I don't even recognise my own name sometimes I feel this constant dissociation from my sense of self and who I am. I was exploring that topic but it feels like sometimes it's my brain maladaptively latching onto something to cope to deal with the pain during the present. Gender is a weird concept and being autistic I've never fit in anyway so perhaps it's just because of that. Honestly I look in the mirror and I feel like I don't recognise myself.

It's this brain fog that gets me down so much I don't know how i am anymore. I fear for my future and i don't have confidence in my ability to perform intellectual functions. My memory doesn't feel as good. I haven't cooked properly for myself in months and I am very dependent on my parents. I do cover some shifts at a local charity shop and I volunteer there which is good. I also do have some friends. I just feel so lost without running and I need it back without it I don't have a sense of purpose. I loved the constant sense of grandiosity with it and feeling above the whole world it was so addictive. I want that back. This sense of sheer confidence superior to anything i have since or prior to that. when I run i am a different person.

I am trying to get the bottom of the issue with my breathing. Thus far I have had my respiratory system checked and I've been told it's normal. Despite this I struggle with a shortness of breath and fatigue and it's like whenever I try to run I feel like I have long COVID and can't run far. I know you do have a factor of detraining to take into account. Additionally I feel like when I am tired and fatigued I often feel like I am wheezing after exercise the day after and can't get enough of an exhale/inhale. I'm using a peak flow meter and I'm getting scores of like 450-500. For your information i am 28 6ft 1 and about 85 kg. However when I use an inhaler I get like almost 700. However it just doesn't add up there much be something else I am not factoring into this equation. My oxygen blood concentration at the doctor's is fine. I suspect too that my brain fog might be connected to my fatigue. Every day I get home I just have to sit down and i feel so tired. I am aware I could do with getting my bloods done to see if I have low iron that might be a possibility.  I am wanting to see a neurologist. I fear somehow with the bleach exposure I've caused some sort of brain damage. I just can't assess or read things to the level I did previously it's a struggle. I know this may not seem this way but it's like whenever I try to read anything my brain is so slow now. I struggle with knowing who I am as put so much value on that sense of my intellectual self and it's the lens I have always seen the world through.

I have been walking through a cemetery just now in an attempt to put my problems in perspective. I know they're not that big they're really not. It's a commonwealth cemetery, so it's those who fought and died for our freedom. Honestly my issues are nothing compared to that.",1703514143.0,

I have been throwing up or feeling extremely nauseous ever since I was a little kid. It started on my first day of school. I was feeling sick mostly before presentations and events like extreme sports or rides at parks. It later developed into going to parties or discos as well, or crowded places like airports and concerts.
I have had this problem my whole life and now I am almost 25 years old and looking for someone who has found a solution to the problem because I haven't. The only solution I have found is drinking small sips of water when being anxious and talking to myself in a very slow way so I do not throw up (of course it doesn't work every time and lend up throwing up).
I also have a fear of vomit (emetophobia) so that makes me additionally more worried and scared of throwing up which leads to more extreme anxiety.

Towards the end I found my group of friends but I still felt very depressed and unsettled. I constantly had anxiety and felt like my life had no purpose.

In 2019 I (22M) graduated high school. Shortly after I got a warehouse job that was fun and good for me. A couple of months went by and in 2020 I got fired from the job. I went into a depression after that. I couldn’t get out of bed, I would barely eat, my sleep schedule was so messed up, I would barely leave my room and I was addicted to my phone. Most of my days were spent in my room and honestly I would barely see daylight. I let that go on until 2022:/. I got another job and it was great. I loved the Job and all my coworkers and everything. I met my now amazing girlfriend there and my life went into a complete 360. Not only did I love that job but I was working out so I was also in really good shape. It was honestly one of the best times in my life. Early 2023 I decided to leave that job. Everything was okay at first but I got too comfortable. I started getting into my old habits again. Bad habits. It’s getting bad and I didn’t realize it. It’s affecting me, my relationship with my gf, and my relationship with my family. I did start going to community college and am a full time student so that’s something I got going but other than that I’m still in a rut.

Minddoesntstop,"story of a friend with crippling anxiety, depression and agoraphobia who got lost inside her own head",14,18n79b1,3,"This is the brief story of an agoraphobic friend who got lost inside her own head: why must the best people suffer? The people who deserve the most love and kindness in this world seem to be the ones who end up with the short side of the stick every time. Life is unfair to say the least. Let’s get into it:  
I woke up with a few plans to get things done today: catch up on laundry, clean the floors, go over to the parents for a coffee, do  groceries, and maybe get some writing done. I woke up at 9:30am, made my coffee, sat down at the kitchen table at 9:45 and haven't got up once yet, it's now 1pm. I scrolled, I jotted notes down about things I read online, I read a couple pages of a book, but I mostly just sat here in a daze, gazing out the window like a lost puppy. My mind can't focus on anything because it keeps bringing me back to Kate.    
  
 Kate is my girl that I hadn't seen in a while (close to two years) who gave me a surprise visit a couple days ago. I used to see her a lot more, even when she was diagnosed with agoraphobia, I was the only friend she allowed into her apartment. I brought her a coffee and a bagel almost every morning because I knew she was the kind of person who needed a routine, as well as a feeling of safety, knowing someone is always there for her. If not she would unravel it seemed.    
  
 I brought her groceries, books, clothes, the little things, anything she needed. I even made more late night liqour store runs than I can count. Her need for numbing herself seemed to increase as the years went on.    
  
 When she asked me one morning not to come I was a little worried but I let it slide, she needed alone time that day, everything was good. The next day she said the same thing and even after me insisting I stop by, she didn't allow it. She seemed angry, so I left it alone. The whole week she told me not to come, until I made my own decision to pick up a few basic supplies and go drop them off. She had to be getting low on food, and toilet paper I didn't care what she said, I was going to see her.    
  
 When I got there I heard moaning, and whining it sounded like, coming from the other side of her door. Then muffled whispers. I knocked a few times before I used my key to let myself in. Kate was on the floor in a fetal position, rocking back and forth whining and whispering to herself, her fingernails making their way from her cheeks to her neck, tearing her skin apart, drawing a unexpected amount of blood for just fingernails.    
  
 I thought maybe she had hurt herself real bad so I ran over to her. She belted out something incoherent when she lifted her head to look at me, while she continued to scratch at her face. I bent down to help her up and she scratched at me too, and almost hissed it seemed like. Then she put her hands over her ears and kept screaming ""LEAVE ME ALONE!"" repeatedly, at the top of her lungs. I told her the neighbors were going to call the cops soon. I guess she really didnt want to deal with other people so she eventually calmed down after about five minutes straight of this.    
  
 When she seems to be in a rational mindset again she looks at me so calmly and says ""Why are you still here? I don't want you here, I don't need anybody. I want to sit here and rot in my pity until this suffering ends. I need you to go and promise me you wont come back."" As her friend that has been by her side since the fifth grade, I was shocked and saddened. I thought things would get better as we got older and she realized there was a whole world out there with no reason for us to be defined by our past. For her, everything seemed to get worse with time.    
  
 I wasnt just going to walk out of that apartment and never look back. I stayed and tried to reason with her, tried to see where this sudden darkness was coming from. She told me to just let her go, there is no hope for her now and there never will be. She talked of her tortured mind, the whispers, the demons and the walking nightmares. She lived in a bubble of her past. She could not let go.    
  
 Eventually she started screaming again and clawing at her face. She threw a remote, a fork and glass my way, missing every time. I tried to calm her down but when she put a knife to her wrist threatening to kill herself if I didnt leave right then, I panicked and proceeded to leave. I asked her to promise me she wouldnt hurt herself if I did leave and I used the guilt card because I know it would make a difference when it came to Kate. Letting people down was something too hard for her to bare. So I told her I would never forgive her if she harmed herself.    
  
 I called her later that day, she seemed to be back to her normal self except the melancholy in her voice was deeper it seemed. She apologized but told me she wanted to do this on her own from now on, she had to prove to herself she is a worthy being capable of living her life without a babysitter. She needed to feel like she had some sort of purpose. At first I got a little mad at her and told her that I didn't care what she wanted because I know what she needs. She spends most of her time alone already, living with her nightmares. I couldn't imagine her being okay with being alone all the time.   
  
 Eventually she convinced me that she really was okay and she knows she needs this to be the next step in her journey. She was done with living in the past. Kate was ready to get back out there and was actually making the first step? If me stepping back helps get that done in anyway, I was all for it. I told her I'd still be calling to check up though and possibly drop off some goods and leave them outside her door. She told me not to but I did anyway.   
  
 At first I called her every day but as time went on the calls got shorter, and she answered them less. Any time I did talk to her though she seemed as if she was getting better each phone call. Almost as if she just didnt want me in her life anymore and was doing great without me. She told me she was making slow steps in leaving the house at least once a day. I took her word for her it although hard to believe.    
  
 I've stopped by her apartment with coffee, bagels, croissants, muffins, and even her favorite candies and she never let me in. Sometimes I'd get to see her eye poking through the peek hole, but she never opened the door for me. She hardly even spoke to me through the door. After a year of pleading and begging for her to let me see her, I really did step back. I gave her space. I still called but eventually she stopped answering, and soon after the number had been disconnected altogether. This was after about a year and six months of not seeing her. I got worried not knowing her situation so I went to her apartment looking for her, for the landlord to tell me she moved out five months ago now. He didn't know where she was going and couldnt tell me even if he did. Confidentiality. I tried to pay him off incase he really did know, to no avail.    
  
 I went home and spent the day trying to find her online as well as call anyone close to her to see if they had seen her. No one has seen her nor heard from her. She didn't have many people in her life, her mom died at a young age and dad left so she was put into the system. The only ""parents"" she does know were abusive emotionally, psychically and sexually. I knew she would never call them for any help so I didnt even bother. I called up her foster brother Abel and he said he hasn't heard from her in years. They had a blow up a few years back and never reconciled.    
  
 I decided I should call the police. They told me that she was a grown woman and was aloud to do whatever it was she wanted. They checked her records and seen that she was still using her credit cards, but failed to tell me where because ""confidentiality."" I guess I could be an axe murderer looking for one specific girl to kill? It pissed me off either way. Kate pissed me off more, how could she be so selfish? Until I seen her again, she knew all I would do is worry.    
  
 What the hell was she doing? She needed me, I was all she had. Like I said the only ""family"" she had was her emotionally abusive foster mother who used to degrade her everyday, embedding the words useless, ugly, disappointment, loser and more into her young mind.  Her bedtime stories were of demons and serpents taking over her mind and life because she was good for nothing, a waste of space. Stories of how she would end up a hooker or dead in a cold alleyway with the stray dogs feasting on her. At least she would be good for something, her mother would tell her: feeding the starving dogs. Stories about how no one would ever love her or miss her. Then she had her foster father who was the friendliest guy in the world but liked to make his little girl ""feel good"" he would say. But it had to be their little secret. Fucking disgusting. She never told me this until a few years ago.    
  
 She had Abel, they were close growing up but it seemed he started to feel estranged from Kate the more neurotic and angry she got as the years went on. They seemed to drift apart and then had a falling out that neither of them cared to fix.    
  
 Kate and I had our group of friends growing up but she was always indifferent to us. She was a loner and most of the time would try to stick to herself. I forced her to go out and participate in activities. I never realized until now when I look back, how much sadness Kate carried around with her. She was the kindest person I have ever met, with a heart of gold. The kind of kid who would squish herself up against the door in a 3 seater car seat, so that the other people sitting with her would be comfortable. The kind of girl who would step over an ant or release a spider instead of killing it. Any room she was in she was always trying to make sure everyone was comfortable and content. She cared so much for every living thing, to never get any good in return but she tried so hard to keep her spirits up for years. But looking back I see now, she was fighting a losing battle with herself.    
  
 After high school Kate eventually met a guy who showed all the signs of prince charming. He treated her like gold at first until the hitting started. And the emotional abuse. He was slowly grooming her and programming her mind to believe that what he was doing wasnt wrong and that she deserved it. This went on for years, and she never told anyone. She was a good actress.    
  
 She bent over backwards for this guy as he slept around on her, didnt call some nights leaving her hanging and worried she had did something to upset him and that she would lose him. He made her abort a baby convincing her she was unfit to be a mother, and that the kid would come out a devil child. He held a power over her. She felt like needed his approval in order to be looked at as a worthy woman. When he eventually left, telling her that all she was a rag doll with no spine or guts, trash and unlovable to any respected man, she retreated from the world.    
  
 That's when she stayed in her apartment most days only leaving to go to her publishing job where she sat in an office by herself until her shift ended and she headed back home. After a few months of this, she realized how much safer the world was inside these four walls. ""No one can hurt me now don't you see? And I cant hurt anyone but myself in here."" I remember her telling me all those years ago. I thought it was just a phase. A year and a half later she was diagnosed with agoraphobia. It wasnt a phase.   
  
 At twenty-three, after three years of hiding out she developed lupus, a disease that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs (autoimmune disease). She started drinking heavily. And medicating herself. She was on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety which only seemed to numb her fully. I was slowly losing my Kate. She got better one year, worse the next, good for a month, bad for five. I was used to it. Until all this happened and she cut me out of her life completely and went and did God knows what.    
  
 After trying for a couple weeks trying to figure out her whereabouts, I slowly started to come to terms with it. People come and people go, its life. If I wasnt beneficial to her journey anymore and she needed to cut me out, I get it. That was her decision and it was selfish of me to try to force myself on her. I let her go, and there was silence between us for close to two years. I only hoped she was doing good and hopefully living her best life.    
  
 Two days ago when she showed up unexpectedly, she proved the opposite. Her eyes were sunken in, her skin purple and thin. Her hair was matted in three different places, her clothes old looking and battered, and she smelt like she's been sleeping in a dumpster. I'm not sure what the look on my face portrayed to her but as quick as she came, she was trying to turn around and leave again mumbling about how shes a fuck up for coming, she should have never disturbed my life again, shes a loser, a waste of space. She started hitting herself in the head until I grabbed her and held her close.    
  
 My Kate, I missed her so much. I failed to help her and shes gotten herself into this mess, what kind of friend am I? I should have never let her do it on her own. When I was hugging her the waterworks started pouring out of me. I failed her. I wiped off my tears and brought her inside.    
  
 The look in her eyes broke my heart. She wasn't Kate anymore. She didn't have one sign of light left in her. It's as if she went to go live the life she was told she was destined to live.    
  
 People who live soft can be undone by beasts. People who live along the beasts have the advantage. Kate could never move in unsion with these monsters who called themselves human. She could never wrap her mind around how people could be so monstrous, over the years it broke her. Now more than ever it seemed. I seen no hope in her eyes.    
  
 I sat her down at the kitchen table and asked her where she had been. She wasnt ready to talk yet but I could tell she had so much to say. I didnt push her, instead I asked her if she wanted something to eat or if she wanted to take a hot bath and relax. She agreed to the bath, I offered her a glass of red which she gladly accepted and she soaked in the bath for close to an hour.    
  
 When she got out she looked a little livelier. A little bit more color in her face. I poured her another glass of merlot, knowing I didn't even have to ask. I poured myself one as well, preparing myself for the turn of events I was about to hear. I turned the voice recorder on my phone on just in case something happened. She didnt look or seem like Kate anymore and it worried me a little, I'm not gonna lie.   
  
 She shared nothing of where she has been, instead she said ""I'm done Kay, this is it. I wanted to say goodbye."" I tried to interrupt her and ask her what she meant, but she kept going before I could.    
  
 ""In a dream my instinct for survival told me to keep going, to find a place to hide. I've learned along my journey not to trust the shadows and the ghosts but it is becoming harder. And there is no where to hide. All of it is becoming increasingly harder. Everything. I'm exhausted. I sold my soul to sickness and painkillers long ago. I have become a hostile, irrational then rational, agreeable then insulting, passive aggressive, cruel, sadistic, deeply disturbed type of person. I don't know where I am or who I am anymore. Despair, agony and pain runs through every vein. I try to move on but the weight of the world gets stronger everyday. Each road marked by false signs, happiness for me, Kay, is a distant relative. I see other people able to fight off the dark and really live their lives but me,  I'm stuck and I envy the ones who aren't. Envy and resentment are terribly corrosive passions and I am destroying myself with this and everything else that kills me. I am an enemy of human happiness, a curse upon the human race and for once and for all, I'm done. I just wanted to let you know that if it wasn't for you, I'd be done long ago.""    
  
 I actually let her get all that out before speaking up. I seen that her hands were both sitting on the table in front of her, therefore I didnt expect her to do anything irrational like pull out a damn knife or gun or anything crazy. Then I said ""Okay Kate let's be rational here. Let's be smart. What are you going to do? Stop this nonsense talk, you are going to stay here with me for a bit and we will figure it out together."" Although my plan was to get her into a suicidal prevention place or a mental ward I guess you'd call it, I wasnt going to tell her that right at this moment.    
  
 ""No, I knew you would try to convince me but this is it Kay! This is it!! Stop!"" She started smashing her fists over her head harder than I've ever seen her do. She was causing damage probably internally she wasnt hitting so hard. She pulled out a razor blade attached to some sort of plastic, (looking like a shiv you would see in prison) and held it up to her neck. She was crying hysterically. ""I'm done Kay I'm sorry I dont want to do this here though, so just let me go."" She knew I wasnt going to let her go anywhere. Either she was taking her life right there in front of me or she wasnt doing it at all. I was scared to approach her.   
  
 She was shaking like a leaf and looked like she was out of her mind completely. She dropped the blade unexpectedly after about three minutes of threatening to hurt herself or me if I didnt let her leave. I ran up to the blade, put it on the counter far away from her and held her close as she leaked tears and boogers all over my sweater. I called the cops with my right hand over her shoulder and hung up right away, knowing they would come but also not wanting Kate to know I called.    
  
 Kate was at a loss for words, a little angry it seemed but submissive when they got there. She didn't say much after that. She was restrained for safety measures and put in the back of the cop car. I asked if I could follow behind they said it was fine they took her to the hospital where we all went in together and she was admitted into the mental health facility in the section D of the hospital. Just until they could figure out if she is in need of real, paid help and they would send her somewhere better.    
  
 I went out and bought her coffee and a bagel from her favorite bakery, I stopped for some goodies at the store: all her favorite snacks and treats. I grabbed some of her favorite books from my place and I also picked up a few sudoku and crossword books to distract her mind a little. Kate was heavily medicated when I got there to drop off the stuff. I gave her a kiss on the cheek and headed out.    
  
 This all happened two days ago now. I am going to try my best to visit her every day and the days I cant, I will call her. My main goal in life right now is get my girl Kate back on her feet.    
  
 Why is it that depression takes over the best people? The ones with the biggest hearts who would go to the end of the earth to make even a stranger happy. Why couldn't life even out a little bit, give us a little bit more fair times and less unfair ones? The saying goes ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" but no, how about ""what doesn't kill you makes you emotionally traumatized and damaged for years to come unless you have a strong enough mind power to overcome the bullshit.""    
  
 Life is just unfair sometimes and its unfortunate to say the least.. I just want Kate, for once in her life to find some form of her own twisted happiness is this chaotic, sometimes confusing like world.",1703111695.0,

SaintKapeie34,A story that happened to me a few years back.,1,18ngcix,0,"I just wanted to share this story if anybody sees, but this happened my 2nd year in college(Im still in college now); that year was hectic for me. I was taking my chemistry class at my downtown college and I dropped it because I had some rude colleagues in the class, neither did it help that my teacher spoken nothing about her experiences in college rather than help me with original questions I asked for her help; on top of doing my best to study, I still done poorly. Me, I’m an anxious person, I don’t like working with people in a group so being in that class made it hard to work with some rude group members (I dealt with people who didn’t want to cooperate with me when I tried to form a study group with my original group mates, and the said group mates would be rude if I misunderstood something that happened in the class; BTW, these were the ones who would question me on my decision, then turn around and ask for my help). 

I dropped the class passed the date you could get money, spending 500 at least for the class, the lab book and the chemistry book for the class; this is a community college I didn’t mention. 

As bad as I thought that was, walking downtown was worse; I remember a restaurant I order tacos plates from, the people sitting at the bar gave me a dirty look, so did the bartender. All I wanted to so was order and I told him I was new; of course he was being an ass (he was), and it hurt me because I was already upset from being stressed and sadden by the chem class. Then another encounter downtown was two workers? (I’m assuming they were because they were leaning against a building); I was blocks away walking straight their way, it was a way to get to where I was going. The woman and man, the man taunted me by leaning down with his hands on his knees, glaring at me for a long time; when I walked past them, i looked at my phone because I was nervous.

I pretty upset after all that happened; the bartender incident upset me the most because I remember I cried hard that night, it didn’t help I was so upset I stared getting angry at my family; they kinda just told me, “oh well.”

I just thought about this story and i wanted to share it; if this ever happened to you, I hope everything is better. This is my first post here, and I appreciate anyone who looks at this; thank you. I like to hear if anything similar happened to anyone else.",1703139812.0,

 I don’t want to be on medication out of fear for the baby if I go that route. My anxiety even cripples me thinking about that!!

Hi! It’s my first time posting here. Ive never been one to post my problems publicly but I can’t help it anymore… i really need some advice. In my country, mental health checkups are not covered by insurance so it can be quite expensive. I don’t have money to get checked up but recently my mental health is becoming worst and I don’t know how stop it. I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember and it has made me miss a lot of great opportunities because of it and I can’t help but mull over everything that I missed out on. Recently, my thoughts have been so hard to control and my mind keeps self sabotaging. I feel like everyone, including my friends, are pitying me or looking down on me and I know they wouldn’t think of me that way but deep down that’s what I feel.

Severe anxiety, and heart palps are the main reason honestly. Heart felt like it was skipping beats all the time, irregular rhythms, and different types as well. Thuds, random palps at night, skipped heart beats. It’s been a lot honestly

Went to a cardiologist. They said my EKG was abnormal. Said an electrical node in my heart looks off, that I had an extra beat for sure in my upper chamber of my heart, and a heart murmur. Very discouraging.

I feel like I keep pushing the people closest to me away... or maybe they are separating themselves from me. 

I have major self confidence issues. I view myself as stupid, and unable to see the world for how it actually is, or unable to figure out how to be a fun person to hang around. Last night I got high and I was talking to my friend about their situation, and I keep pushing them to make choices that I felt like would be the right choices for them, but I did so without understanding their whole situation and I ended up hurting my friend by causing them anxiety and frustration. I apologized and I was forgiven but now that I learned I upset them at all, I feel as if this is further proof of my stupidity. 

I'm wondering if I'm just like this as a person, and everyone can see me as this annoying pest that they gotta put up with... Am I overthinking this? I just need to know how to stop making mistakes that hurt other people. If all people expect from me is a person spouting nonsense they don't understand, then no wonder I'm losing my closest relationships. Maybe I'm just the problem here. 

I just wish I knew how to fix every negative trait I have so I don't hurt people or push them away. Even though I was forgiven, I feel like I ruined my friendship with this person with my mistake and now I'm freaking out because I don't want to lose another friend.

RAMENtheBESTcatEVER,Self harming for a release.,2,18lwb91,0,"Today I got a better understanding on some of my actions over the years. I self harm and admitting for the first time that I will be bringing it up to my dr and talking about it. 
I DO NOT want to hurt myself in a serious way or pass away. Do not want to hurt others. I found there is “nonsuicidalself-injury disorder” 

When I was a teenager I used a blade and cut. Small paper it depth cuts. A few times I went over the same one more then once but I don’t want them to show. I just wanted to feel so I did them on my left upper arm. When my mom started to notice I was winding down on the desire to need to feel what I did from them. As I got older and had more acess to the internet I learned there’s other self harmful behaviors people do and I noticed that I do a lot of them too. 

Picking skin till you bleed, I will pick or obsess and use nail clippers and a manicure set to get rid of all the dead skin. 

If I have an ingrown toe nail I will try and cut my nail so I can rip out some from the cuticle. 

I take showers that are all hot and leave my body red for a good few min after. I don’t know why I like the way it feels. I start with a warm shower and slowly lower the cold. It’s harder to do in a bath but easier for me in the shower. 


(I am27) I have set myself up in situations where I drank too much and knew I should have stopped and didn’t and didn’t feel good after because I liked that I was able to escape the daily life when I was drinking. There was a whole my friends and I would go out and get drinks a lot and I would drink and it felt good to escape in my head and be able to loosen up and relax more. 

I have used weed as the same thing. I was always home when i would get high and just watch a movie or giggle in a voice call with my friends and play video games and I would enjoy myself more. 

I have a lot of overwhelming constant thoughts that I feel I can’t escape. Writting a list turns into hyper fixation in the list and making a list for things on the list and then hyper fixation of the lists needing to all look uniform and match with a box or a circle and I can’t cross out words in the middle. It turns my brain on more then it shuts it up. 

I have had times I pick at scabs because they feel good to peel off. 
I have self reported my ear cartridge one night in my bedroom cause I was really wanting that earring again and didn’t feel like paying for it. That didn’t hurt but the healing process was always a constant sensitivity that reminded me of it and gave a lil release. Same with some wounds. Rubbing over a cut or a burn to put cream on or shower is a reminder of the pain and yes hurts but also helps that brain release. 

I don’t like that I do this. I don’t like feeling like I can’t talk openly to a dr about what’s going on in my head cause I’ll end up in a grippy sock vacation with people who actually are a danger of seriously hurting themselves or others or have something serious. I would need like a step down like a “ok you can take my shoe laces and phone cord but like I don’t need to be watched 24/7 and I don’t need to be doped up where I can’t function. I would only wanna be there to talk about what really is going on in my head and why I feel like these help but I don’t have words for all of it. I don’t understand it all myself. 

I understand thou what the autistic kids who hurt themselves feel like thou. They dont wanna hurt themselves but it’s a release. Its a coping mechanism but for a lot of them they don’t know when to stop and hurt too much causing it to be a cycle where they keep hurting themselves cause they need that release because they just caused an issue by hurting themselves. 

I see my primary in a few days. I’m not a danger. I was just thinking about “how hard would it be to do a stick and poke tattoo” and next thing I know I had drawn with a sharpie a small shape and had a sewing needle poking a bunch in the line. I know that’s not smart or how it’s done but I didn’t realize I was doing it till I already did. I had been hand sewing so the needle was already on my desk and my markers were out so they were both just infront of me and I was listening to music and suddenly snapped out of a fog and realized what I was doing and stopped and cleaned myself up and I got upset at myself for doing it and I looked into more of why. 

I do have a lot of stress going on in my life and yesterday something big happened. I accidentally hur a curb and caused damage to the tires and something under the car as well as air bags went off. The airbags passanger side curtain airbag and the seat side airbag going off was terrifying and I felt in a fog all day after and today. I didn’t know why I felt the haze. It was the moment the airbags went off, there was a loud bang and then that side of my face felt funny and my ear was ringing. I think the face was from the air pressure from the bags going off and my vision like went all white for a min when the airbags went off. And after what moment everything was different and a haze. I knew I was alive and not hurt. I just felt out of it and I felt like just grabbing my fav blanket and “emotional support water bottle” and crawling in a hole to listen to music or watch tv and not let anyone come near and not function and have my safe food snacks with me. I just felt so out of the norm. I have been to college. I have had a normal full time job. I can function in my own and since the accident to me realizing I tried to do a stick and poke I wasn’t me. I wasn’t able to function. I was just blank and focused only on the way it felt when the airbags went off. I couldn’t think clearly. I couldn’t function easily. I had to think hard about thi no an and often lost my train of thought. But the. I got the release I needed and I’m back to me and I’m back to feeling like I can function. It’s like when you wake up after surgery. All of a sudden I went from groggy and feeling funny and not knowing but not caring that I don’t know or can’t reach the object to being able to function and if I didn’t know, I knew how to find out and I would find out so I did then know and could move forward and do and get things done I needed. 

I know I’m not the only one who has to have felt this way. I had noticed over the past few months I was obsessing over the nail care and some things like pimples and minor things that I could do to cause pain but yet made me feel better and I wasn’t sure why I was doing them but then it recently started to click more and then this fog I just had it fully clicked in my mind that there’s a real reason I’m doing things and that I need to look into this more and figure it out and talk to a professional and I now know how to word things so I don’t end up in a grippy sick vacation drugged out of my mind strapped to a bed cause I don’t need or want that extreme of help.",1702971271.0,

She sends me like one snap a day, when I text her about plans sometimes she takes a whole day to respond. I do still see her maybe 2 times a month tho. What really has me upset is when it comes to occasions she doesn’t try much to make plans with me but instead her and her bf will join her older brothers friends. I texted her asking if she’d want to spend new years together and it took her 2 days to tell me that her and her bf r going to her brothers gfs party. Which is the same thing she told me last year. I just feel hurt that for things like that she doesn’t care to try and make plans with me and my bf. I’ve communicated this to her a little before but she always has excuses. We’re supposed to have our annual Christmas sleepover together in 3 days and I can’t even bring myself to text her back. I just feel really upset but I don’t want to overreact what should I even do:(",1702954001.0,
NAVGTR___,I have a small thang and it makes.me wanna kill myself,9,18l31yo,12,"

I am incredibly embarrassed, ashamed, and self conscious about my wiener size. I am a highschooler ATM, I am 6'1 and 220 lbs, Abt or at 5 inches (I am not fat, I am a gym rat) 

I wanna start off with saying I am just probably just blinded by either social pressure on the topic of sex,  porn, or the societal image that big penises are the shit. But I am unsure due to the lack of comfort talking about this subject, of whether I am just being hyper self critical or if I have actually lost the game of genetics. I have always been very self critical as my friends and family have told me, and always finding myself taking things personally or to literally, and feeling like I am always behind, or that everyone is better than me. That if I am not the best at something, or if I am not good enough, that I have no value. I think that this has maybe set me up for failure when it came to wieners. regardless, that is just a guess. Now having watched porn before, I couldn't but help but feel self conscious comparing myself to the male star with their appendage, or anyone else for that matter. This caused me to get curious, and politely and carefully ask my closest friends what their size was. I am abt 5 inches, probably a little less, and for my stature I immediately fell into self doubt and have been ever since. Not only am I lacking compared to male stars (obviously, they are genetic freaks) but I am lacking behind my friends (good/decent test group size). Friends who are smaller than me in size/stature. Now I am not sure if size has to do with anything with mey wiener, but I am assuming my build has a little bit of play in it. Some of my closest buddies who are sexually active were surprised and didn't believe me for a while. With these being my closest and bestest friends, I do not believe that they are lying, and as results with them and females show otherwise, congruent to their word. I now feel as if I will never be able to please any woman, and never be able to hold a relationship, as I believe is very important part of relationships and important for strong bond I feel like if I were to have a partner, relationship wise and sexually, wanting to please them would be a obvious goal in sex, and the looming thought that I will never reach that and be a disappointment and maybe even a bore in bed when the time comes is chronically depressing. I can't stop thinking about it. Being in highschool, I watch my friends get gfs left and right and lay some pipe, and can't help but feel like I'm last for a reason. I don't have any sexual experience, I've been single my whole life, so granted idk what Im really talking abt, but regardless I feel so pathetic and useless. Am I wrong? Please be brutally honest, I want the truth, as razor sharp as it may be.

HelloStephanies,"Today I had an emotional/mental breakdown. First ever. Help, PLEASE.",0,18l0p4x,0,"This is so hard for me to write. :( 

I have had anxiety for at least 8 years now. My anxiety attacks would occur when I was in back seats of cars (where I was when a serious car accident happened 12+ years ago) and sometimes closed spaces like tunnels and elevators. I began to take anti anxiety meds to help me ONLY when I'd have an attack. Years went by and with therapy, exercise and some anxiety pills here and there, my anxiety settled. I then began ketamine treatment these last 3 months and it SIGNIFICANTLY reduced even the slightest anxious thought or depressed thought. It lifted me back up to feeling like ""normal"" me that I recall myself being. No panic attacks in cars, no fear in flying, no weird anxious thoughts in elevators-- nothing. I am grateful, beyond grateful, for those ketamine treatments. My mind can stop and say: nope, nothing happening here, no need to panic. Again, so grateful.  


But now...here comes my new monster.  


It's been a month now that I have **physical** anxiety in my body. My throat tightens, my chest feels rushes like caffeine (no heartbeat issues, no feelings of air running out that normally accompany mental anxiety attacks), and yet my brain can tell me ""hey, you're cool, nothing is happening."" So while I can mentally be calm and cool, rational and logical, no mental triggers, my throat and chest feel these odd rushes/tightening moments. They come every few minutes then disappear. I feel them, wonder why the hell they're there and then they pass. The throat feeling tight (yes, I can breathe just fine so it's not an allergy or anything), has been happening for a solid month-- sudden tightness on both sides and then release. The chest rushes (and often cold feeling near the center), has been the last 3 weeks. I decided to go back to the gym and hit it hard so that my body can stop with this.  Last night, even after the gym, my chest and throat kept doing that and I had to take an anxiety pill to calm myself. I also cried and cried out of desperation for what was happening. My boyfriend was there to console me. I cried out of frustration bc I can't figure out what's wrong with me. Yes, I dislike my  part time job that's remote (3 years with them), yes I feel like I'm not doing enough in life, yes I dislike where I'm living (in another country and don't quite have a life here) and feel alienated--but I'm going to therapy, I'm going to the gym, I have my little dog of 6 years, I do things with my boyfriend, I have a functioning car and a  little home I rent -- I count my blessings. Yet I feel **purposeless** and really at a dead end, low pay job and dead end feeling in life. The job hunt overwhelms me as I prepare to ""change my life"" somehow. So today, I go to the gym with my boyfriend of 8 months who is from here, and I ask him to do a workout with me-- just one ab exercise to tag team (he holds my legs, I hold his kind of deal) and he said he didn't want to do. I replied: ""oh, come on dont be like that, let's just do one together, I need some help."" I also was tapping into the happy mood I was in at that moment bc/  1) it was for being out, 2) being with him, 3) exercising and doing something good for me/us.  So he does the exercise, with a bad mood, and I realized after his 1st set, it wasn't worth continuing so I said: ""Alright, no more...I see you don't like it."" He walked off and that was that. Later on, we had a miscommunication that led to him being really upset with me and leaving the gym (which i didn't realize until I couldn't find him at the gym anymore and called him on the phone) and my mood went south bc/ I knew it was going to be my fault. The argument was over me saying that one guy had the same type of legs as his and they looked just fine (since what I heard my boyfriend say was ""don't ever let me get calves like those"") and the guy had good legs which I didn't understand why he was saying that. I misheard the part where he said: don't let me get  (wear) socks on my calves like those. My boyfriend took my response as my checking that guy out and so he decided to call me out for an incident last weekend where I asked him if he was checking out a girl (because he was watching her over and over again at the restaurant we were at.)  He said: ""when I look at a girl, you call me out for being a perv (this was his interpretation not a word I used) and then you're over here seeing a guy and telling me his legs look good and look like mine. So, I'm a pig for looking but you're ok to do that?"" No matter was I said, guys, I was losing this battle. He was in such, SUCH, a bad and mean mood, that my happy-post workout high was steadily declining. He kept telling me that I didn't listen, that he's always the one wrong and not me, that I do nothing wrong,/it's always him, that he's the pig, etc, etc. He got so *mean* and cold, that no matter what I said, he'd shoot it down. Nothing was being accepted as a ""hey, we had a miscommunication, I wasn't checking him out. Hey, I just wanted to enjoy the workout vibe for a moment and do something together."" It was me being selfish when he said no, and me being a hypocrite and how would I like it if he said he liked a girl's legs that looked like mine. I started to feel so low and so frustrated and realizing I was getting nowhere no matter what I said that I snapped. I snapped in .0003 seconds and threw my water bottle toward the center console and just said: "" Fine! I am done! I am a piece of shit and you never have to see me again, ever. Don't call. Don't worry about me, don't look for me. You will never have me in your hair ever again. ever. I will put your stuff outside the door right now (we were in front of my house in his car and it was just his backpack I was referring to) and you won't ever have to deal with me again. Never again, Never again, ever again will you see me. You never have to deal with me again!""  I was breathing so hard, shaking like crazy, grabbing my stuff frantically, crying like I've never cried before and soon hyperventilating. I would make my way up my stairs and was crying like I have truly never cried while breathing like I was gasping for air. I was making loud noises like I was losing my mind. I cried my face totally red, was pacing around the house and didn't stop crying for an hour. I could not calm myself nor think straight.  


He came upstairs, got some tea that helps me when I'm anxious and said please drink this. I was still shaking and in some state of emotional explosion that was freakish. I snapped, guys. Full on snapped. I felt so low and so frustrated and shitty that I emotionally snapped. Never has this happened to me. I'm now crying again just thinking about how scary that was to feel.   


**What is happening to me?** What are these rushes of anxiety in my chest and throat that don't seem to go away even in calm moments and where there IS NO THREAT? What is happening to me, please?  
 Do I need to start a low dose anxiety treatment for a period of time to fix this? If it's not mental, how do you get rid of it? Is this my life telling me that I need to change everything about it and get the hell out of where I am? Is this the end of my life?

lowkeyduckk,Do you resent your mother for emotionally neglecting you?,18,18kdd6m,7,"
For the longest time, I couldn't figure out why I was constantly angry with my mother. Simple conversations triggered me, leading me to respond rudely. I felt guilty and apologized, people-pleasing to make up for it. A year ago, I realized this stemmed from my childhood, where I resented her for neglect, lack of validation, and understanding.

This unresolved anger affects my daily life, causing self-doubt, low self-esteem, and minimal confidence. I've lost touch with myself, neglecting my needs and feelings. Despite her changed behavior, I struggle to forgive, especially witnessing her different treatment with my elder sister.

I really want to move out. Though my mother's behavior improved, the scars from childhood persist, affecting work, relationships, and causing anxiety even for simple tasks. I seek approval constantly, struggle to communicate, and battle serious anxiety.

I keep testing positive and not sure if they are now false positives after the first day of obvious symptoms and a home positive result.

I paint for a hobby and that helps, but rarely do my kids call, and I have only had one son visit me twice since moving here in July. My kids have put me at arms length since the divorce.

So I talked to my mom abt my anxiety, cause it’s based around my heart. I’m scared I’m going to have a heart attack. I had a lot of palps last month due to a THC induced panic attack, and with that came severe anxiety and palpitations. My heart would constantly skip beats, one time I felt it doing that for hours so I went to urgent care to get an EKG and it came out…normal. I’ve gotten blood work and 5 EKGs done and they came out normal, except for one, that said I had a slight abnormality. So I’m going to a cardiologist to get it checked out, which is honestly scaring me even more. 


Since I started anxiety meds, I’ve felt better, less palps, which gave me less anxiety, except for at night I would get a pretty big heart thud out of the blue, which cause my anxiety to go up again and I would get smaller heart palps that I could barely feel. When my EKG came back abnormal, my anixety went up again and I keep going down the rabbit hole of not being able to stop thinking about it. I constantly feel heart palps now, like thumping heartbeats. The more anxious I am the harder they’d be.

Let’s get into it… alright, so I started Abilify about two weeks ago for my depression (I recently realized I’d fallen into a deep depression again. It had been years since being this bad). I noticed immediately that it made me quite tired. Side effects, I get it.

Well, I no longer get tired easily or stay tired early in the morning. I think that side effect is a bit gone. However, the last couple of days I’ve been wondering if alcohol and/or weed consumption cause sleepiness. EDITED TO SAY: they’re downers so of course it can cause sleepiness. I know this. I’m 38, so I know the difference in *that* type of sleepiness versus what I’m experiencing. 

If you aren’t a weed or oil person, it’s fine. I occasionally partake or have a drink in the evenings while I game with my husband. Last night I smoked for the first time in a while and could barely keep my eyes open at a time I’m normally pretty awake. This morning, we went to have brunch and ordered a mimosa service. After a flute and a half I was buzzed. By my 4th flute I was damn near intoxicated. Once we got home I was so tired that I just instantly fell asleep.

Most medications suggest to not take with alcohol, but I wonder if anyone has had similar experiences. Have you been incredibly tired or quicker to buzz while on Abilify?

Choice-Fortune7468,Sharing my story with anxiety/panic disorders and would love to hear your advice.,1,18hyw3z,0,"So I first had panic attacks back in 2020 (when I was 25), and was initially triggered by health scares. In 2020 when COVID first broke out, there were a lot of uncertainties and I was really concerned about getting it, especially in NYC you see news every day how the death tolls rise. After isolation for a few months, I went on a date with this girl who told me she had been partying in the city since COVID and had no issues, and I just kept thinking about what she told me because I thought there was a good chance she has it. Then I started to have my first panic attack, basically heart racing, and felt like it was going to explode, I felt convinced I was going to die on the spot and went to the ER like 2-3 times a week, mostly in the middle of the night. Even after I tested negative for COVID, I started to be paranoid and catastrophizing about everything, if I had stomach pain, it might be stomach cancer, if I had headaches, it might be brain tumor etc.. So the anxiety and panic attacks went on for months until I started taking Xanax+Fluvox, which stopped the panic attacks and brought me back to normal life.  
  
I was on those medications for about a year and lived a normal life, and there was one event that tapered me off medication when I ran a 5k in pouring rain and I thought I was gonna get sick for sure, but I did not. I feel like that experience gave me confidence in my health and cured me at the moment. And I was good without panic attacks for a year after that even without medication.  
  
I would like to hear your advice, if you have similar experience, what are the things that you do to overcome anxiety/panic disorders without medication? I feel like dating has been the trigger for both of my periods of anxiety, and I cannot even date anyone without thinking about diseases, it is probably related to the guilt/shame that contradicts the traditional value I grew up believing. Do you have any advice on how to overcome it? s again. Some episodes are so bad that I cannot even work the next day. I have been talking with therapist but feels reluctant to get back on medication again.",1702523150.0,

XxTeaCrimexX,What to do if a friend lives in an abusive family,1,18g86wf,10,"I have this friend, my best friend actually, who i know lives in a very abusive house. He is almost 15 and all his life both of his parents physicaly and verbaly abused him and didnt respect him nor ever hug him or shown him love in any way. 

His parents do not care about him and are only there to complain on his mistakes. My friend is so traumatised that im afraid he wont ever heal and im scared, i dont want him to live like this forever.  For example, one day he was sleeping and his dad told him to wake up and he wanted to sleep a bit more and his dad got so mad just because of that and threw his laptop out the window (He lives at like floor 9 or more). Of course the laptop broke. Now tho, his father is mostly away in other countries due to work and my friend was left home with his mother and sister (his sister is 7 and is on their parents side, her parent love her). His father may have hit him and broke his valuabe things just because he felt like it but believe me, his mother is even worse.

His mother hits him everyday and he barely eats at home. I am trying to help how much i can by bringing him food everyday at school and i trying to take him out of the house once a week so he could be happy, free and himself at least some hours. His mother is more violent physicaly and verbaly than his father and hit him countless times just because he didnt take out the trash in that moment (this happend last week or two weeks ago). She hits him so harshly that he has blood on his bed. And this happens every day when he gets home. He is beaten and screamed at every day.

Last week i had the idea that he should sleep over at my house (we live pretty close) and he agreed but he had to ask his mom and he was really scared to. I didnt think she will do something so i insisted a bit. He asked her and she screamed at him and threw a whole tantrum. His life is a total mess and because of his parents he doesnt have motivation for anything, this year we have to take exams that decide which highschool we enter to and motivation is necessary. 
Im more than sure he has depression, anxiety and autism.

He was used all his life and he grew up with 'friends' who treated him the same as his parents do, im the first person who really sees his value and cares. He is completly destroyed and im scared because i dont want him to harm himself or on general to be harmed by anyone in any way. He just doesnt deserve this horrible torture he has to go through every fucking day.

He is just a child and he never had bad intentions, he doesnt deserve a life so miserable where no one was ever by his side.

I want to help and as i said, im doing the best i can to make his life even a bit worth living. What should i do? How can i help? I have thought of calling the child protection phone number or talking to my mom or a teacher and ill happily do it anytime of the day or night but im scared of what will happen after.

Anyway, I cried on the way to the doctors, while picking up the script and then I went home and took the meds and slept for a bit. I put the tears down to the pain, unusual for me but hey, these things happen.

I wanted to try discord but there's so many servers, and I can barely keep up with a constant flow of chats in text it feels wrong to just hop into a vc.

Recently thought a watching twitch in the background might help but I really need to get separate monitors lol.

lostless-soul,Difficulty speaking at work,7,18ch55y,1,"I have struggled with my mental health over the last couple of years for a variety of reasons, and it is particularly bad at work. I have anxiety with very low self esteem and crippling self doubt.

This all makes me feel very isolated at work, and I have become more and more withdrawn from my colleagues, with this horrible feeling that I don't belong. It's become increasingly difficult for me to talk to my colleagues because I don't feel like I should be drawing attention to myself. I've always been a bit socially awkward and 'the quiet one' in groups, but now even simply saying hello when I arrive is too difficult some days. Recently there have been days when I've literally not said a word to anyone, despite forcing myself to go to the coffee breaks etc. I just sit there, trying to build up the courage to join in the conversation, but rarely manage to. On the odd occasion when I do say something, it's so quiet that nobody hears.

I am desperate to get out of this mindset of not belonging and be able to properly socialise with my colleagues, but I don't know how. I don't want people to think that I am rude or deliberately sullen by not speaking to anyone, but I am also afraid that people will wonder what's going on if I do suddenly start talking.

My sister told me that it’s my anxiety making me thing I have an extra heartbeat when I really don’t, so I put my hand to my pulse on my neck and my chest and I can literally feel the extra beat.

So nothing showed up on the EKG, but as soon as I sat up I could feel the extra heartbeat again??? 

Now I constantly am feeling this extra heartbeat. I describe it as a “thump”. A bigger than normal and more noticeable heartbeat. My sister says that anxiety can cause you to notice your heartbeat more, but I don’t even know anymore. Does anyone else go through this? Could it be PVCs??

webgruntzed,"Maternal Depravation- and Anaclitic Depression-induced isolation, depression, anxiety, maladjustment and more",1,18c9lxs,0,"So after seeing more than a dozen therapists over the past 58 years of my life, not one has given me hope.

The last one I saw did help me understand why I'm like I am.  Maternal Deprivation Disorder is when a baby gets so little affection that its brain doesn't develop properly.  The condition is irreversible.  Once past the toddler stage, that part of the brain is done growing, so it it hasn't developed by then, it never will.

The part of the brain that doesn't develop in this case is the part that lets you feel you're lovable and a valued part of society.

The therapist said the mind is elastic and can overcome, I don't buy it.  She treated me for PTSD, but the thing it it would take a long time and a lot of practice to see any improvement, and frankly it would kill me to do the amount of socializing required to practice it enough to get good at it.  Even then, treating the PTSD might make some improvement in being able to control my reactions, it's not going to make up for the brain damage.

Some of the effects of Maternal Deprivation Syndrome  include:  
  
Social maladjustment/ineptitude  
Isolation  
Anger issues  
Not getting along with other kids (as a child)  
Trust issues  
Lack of self-confidence  
Prone to being bullied and/or bullying  
Difficulty understanding how one's actions will affect others   
Lapses in empathy  
Learning disabilities  
Emotional ""coldness""  
Mood disorders  
Hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection, even if it's only imagined  
Avoidance of people  
Hyper-attention on others looking for any hints of criticism or rejection  
Getting completely exhausted after small amounts of socializing  
Depression  
Omnipresent general anxiety  
Social anxiety  
Insecurity  
Addiction issues or eating disorders (trying to fill the emotional void from not having meaningful relationships)  
Feeling apart from/outside of society  
Hopelessness  
Aggression  
Difficulty forming close relationships/attachment disorders  
  
There's not much that can be done for this.  There's no way to rebuild the part of the brain that didn't develop.  Unfortunately, knowing why I'm like this doesn't help in the slightest.  In fact, it's made it worse.  In the back of my mind I hoped there was some traumatic event that could be uncovered in therapy and I'd get better.  I never imagine I had permanent brain damage.

I unfortunately don't have any advice to offer other than if this sounds like you, focus on the things you enjoy most in life, rather than what you don't have.

goodtymesallround123,I’m so mediocre it hurts.,2,18br77j,2,"I absolutely suck at life in general.  Let me first say that I came from parents who loved me.  I have a fiancé who I love, respect and am happily faithful to (and vice versa if my guess is correct).  I was never around much money in my entire life so all I really want from life is “safety”.  I never want more than what I need. I don’t need 5 bedrooms or a mansion or a million dollars.  I want just enough to break even in life. To live and love well until I die peacefully in my sleep quietly and out of the way in my 90s. I can take nothing's with me so I just want what I need for comfort and a safe space away.

&#x200B;

The problem is that I suck at existing.  My attention span is short and I lose interest in things quickly so learning things I have no interest in is an ice skate uphill.  I had a plan when I went to college. Then that college plan fell through and I tried another and another. Now the money is gone and I’m thousands of dollars in debt with no degree. I took care of my mother until she died. Then my father passed 2 months after.  Once that root of my family tree was gone i felt relief to be done with the care but also like there was no more security net. I am the next generation to die.  I can’t go to my parents if I fall. I have to catch myself. At 39 I’m too old to even think that but I’m being transparent.

&#x200B;

To get to the point, I have had a series of jobs and not a single career.  I was in home health care off and on for 14 years. I finally escaped that and went into manufacturing and assembly. Then I was a school cleaner.  Now I am what they call a compliance coordinator. My best friend is the boss and she needed someone dependable. That’s one trait that I am proud of. I do my best at my job but its not just one job. It’s a small start up and I wear a lot of hats there.  I am also the secretary and the office manager and minor HR. I also work simultaneously part time with what is basically a copy and paste of my full time job. I get treatment plans and other document in a therapy office and I file, upload, proofread and correct them. I also have to get up and open the door for every visitor to the office since we don’t have a buzzer and I’m CONSTANTLY interrupted in my work. I mentioned a short attention span so all that up and down in and out doesn’t help with my progress in my work.

&#x200B;

Something about me, on my best day I am not social.  My fiancé and I are the kind of people who can be jist fine being alone.  Somehow we got lucky enough to find each other and now we are happy alone together. He is the light in my life.  All I need now is to actually be good at something.

&#x200B;

I can imagine the responses here but I will be 40 in a couple months. All of these years and I still have no idea what to do.  I feel so trapped in myself.  I workout very often, I have been eating better and losing weight. I have been all about self improvement and I do like myself in that way.  The issue is that I consider myself a failure.  I cannot stay with a job lately. Either the pay is too low, it’s physically taxing or I am just not smart or skilled enough to perform.

&#x200B;

I have reached a point where I feel trapped.  I can’t breathe!

&#x200B;

 My best friend and I have been friend for 25 years. I don’t collect people and I have a very small circle.  She is independent and she makes smart decisions for the most part plus she isn’t very needy so the friendship works for me.  She is the boss at my current company and I am proud of all she had achieved. Me? Well I got the job through her. She made all the right career decisions in life and I didn’t.  The issue is she wants to be my friend and my boss at the same time.  She keeps her file books in my office (which I keep). They are irrelevant to me but since she has no room in her office they are in mine.  She just walks in or she just slides open my window and starts talking. Rather than just placing a document in my basket she wants to discuss it.  Nothing I do is rocket science and all I have to do it look at a document to know what to do with it.  So I get very annoyed with the interruption regardless of its work or gossip related.  Just let me work!!

&#x200B;

I’m an imposter.  People think I am smart but I am not.  I’m more or less eloquent and I read often but I am more of a Jack of trades yet a master at none. If I were smarter things would be different.  I  feel overwhelmed and incompetent the way I do. Like nothing comes out quite right. Essentially I am doing something wrong and I don’t know how to fix it.  It’s maddening and I have no one to blame but myself.  I just cannot stay where I am.  Work just piles and piles. My friend constantly walks into my office or hands me something else to add to my to-do pile.  And then the door bell rings and I have to basically be the Walmart greeter to whomever walks in. I just want to be left alone to focus! I cannot work with so much movement, talking and interruption going on around me. Maybe I’m on the specials just don’t know it? So much sensory overload and too much interaction and I feel like I have to bail.

&#x200B;

The worst part is I don’t know if my job is really too much, if I’m completely incompetent, or if I’m just a crybaby. Could be all of the above? 

I believe that only naive people believe that life is a gift.  It’s not. It’s an ordeal.  To think that I may have to work in this way for the rest of my life makes me hysterical with dread.  If I could just walk into my office, have it be silent and not have any interruptions I think it would be better.  Even the random things that are just dropped into my lap for me to figure out might be a little better but I don’t mentally handle those well either.  I don’t like surprises and having something dropped into my lap unexpectedly sends me into a mental spiral. “I don’t know what to do with this.  I have to call people to figure out how to accomplish this.  I don’t want to be responsible for this.”  Then if something goes wrong or I overlook something I feel like a burden to my company.

That’s not to say I’m an absolute screw up.  I’ve been there for two years now and got a huge raise.  I’m a perfectionist and if I do something wrong it really really hits me hard. Even if I hate a job it is mine. My name is on it and I try to do my best and take pride. But sometimes it’s just not enough.

&#x200B;

I guess my question is am I alone in this?  Has anyone been here and broken out? Because I can’t see a way out. I am accepting that I am just a failure and it really hurts.  It drenches me in depression and I just want out.

 Thanks for your help.

Basically I've been battling with anxiety for years now and as of fairly recently its my health anxiety I am battling with. Any ache and pain I home in on. But recently, I don't know if it's coincidence or not, but a couple of times after I've eaten big ol' meals, I've had a wave of anxiety come over me almost and my heart pounds and I just feel like I'm gonna die, that horrible feeling that something isn't right. It doesn't happen on a regular basis after eating, but the last couple times it happened was after scoffing huge amounts of pizza quickly! 

Long story short, I googled these feelings when I felt them, because I'm either stupid or was just curious... I found out about Hyperglycemia and its scaring the shit out of me to be quite frank and I'm convincing myself I have it. What's annoying is that yesterday, I ate my usual and felt fine all day and also was extremely relaxed all day, after every meal I ate. To be fair, I actually ate carb heavy meals yesterday and a fair big of chocolate from the quality street tin and I was absolutely fine, so surely if I was Hyperglycemic I'd of felt something yesterday after the kind of stuff I ate. 

I dont usually eat breaky, I start with lunch. Earlier for lunch I ate a cheese and onion pasty, 2 pepperamis and a bottle of Doctor Pepper and I was FINE for literally an hour and I then had to hop on the bus, as the bus was coming to a fault and throwing me about, I suddenly had that anxious feeling, I felt off, my heart started to steadily race and I wanna say I felt dizzy, but I know I was not dizzy because I was still as anything not swaying etc. I wasn't sweating or anything, but as I was doing my inspection on this house, I just felt on edge and weak almost. I just kept thinking how ""there must be something wrong with me""

I'm basically so scared of this Hyperglycemia because I'm petrified of pancreatic cancer and have been for the past few years, even convinced myself I had it at one point and I can feel myself going back to that thought.  I've read that Hyperglycemia can be a sign of it if you don't have diabetes, but then my other thought proccess is ""even if it would turn out to be diabetes, that in itself would indicate pancreatic cancer, so either way dude, you dead and fucked"" 

Anyone got any advice for me, I'm just scared that's all. I've been trying to de stress as much as possible recently but it's a bit hard as I'm studying in college whilst working full time and I'm not used to that either. 

I think, what I'm trying to say is, has anyone else experienced any of this before? Or is there anyone that is actually Hyperglycemic who can tell me either ""yes sounds like you could be"" or ""No dude you're overthrowing shutup""",1701792961.0,

Doing the second year of a bachelor's degree in science. This period (7 weeks, in Netherlands a uni semester is divided into parts), I took an extra subject, just to check it out, because I wouldn't have another chance. I have two more subjects and a lab. But ironically, everything except for the extra subject, has a final presentation to be done for this week. One is tomorrow, next day after, and one more on Friday.

And my head just broke. I can't do any of the work, and it's all group stuff, so I'm literally hurting other people, like if I didn't have enough reasons to hate myself. So tonight I shut down and gave up, still terrified of what's next, because such a thing will bear consequences for how the rest of my uni goes. Normally I do have a support circle of good friends here, but right now they are also under a ton of pressure, so there's little they can do for me. I chatted with a suicide hotline quite a bit, because I felt so stuck with no way out, but they eventually wanted to wrap it up, I guess because it's middle of the night and many people need help.

I just need to talk. I'm disturbed to the point of confusion. I want to tell someone about all my problems. I feel like I'm dying and need someone else to save me (of course not literally possible, as well as I'm not literally dying, but that's the feeling).

sharkov63,Non-stop Anxiety about the future,11,18aqcx7,7,"I (21M) am constantly worried about the future. It's constant fear and pain: nobody gives a damn about me, I will be alone, and I will have nothing. No money, no education, no work, no food, no happiness. I am 100% certain I will suffer and die alone, unless I kill myself before that. And recently I think of suicide too often. And the reasons of why I think so are ridiculous, no problem at all for other people.

 I study Comp.Science at a university (3rd year bachelor's), and I work a software engineer at RnD part-time. I've been diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depression disorder since I moved to another city to study after school. I've been seeing a shrink once a week since March this year, it's been a great help overall about understanding myself but I just don't change. Actually I'm seeing her this Thursday, but damn, I want to die now, so I write this post now.

I've been in a relationship since the end of school, and we've been living together in a rented 1 room apartment since summer 2022. My girlfriend is a narcissist, and I am emotionally dependent on  her. I should leave her, but hey, every time I think we've resolved our problems a bit, so hey, let's continue and see how it goes. 

My father wants me to arrange a mortgage: 2 room apartment, which costs $153000 . He will pay for part of the first pay (20% which is $30600), and then will help with the  monthly payment ($ 700). Since I work 20 hours a week and not 40, my income is $875 a month, and that is too small for the mortgage. We will find a way to write additional income, so we will probably can still get the mortgage. Now I don't know what to do, I work only part time because I also study. I'm afraid to work full time because then I will dump my university and I will have no education.

I'm doing very well on my job, I like it and I want to continue my career there. I am extremely qualified, especially given my age and short work experience (18 months). But I also now feel that I am underpaid. But I don't even briefly know how much I   cost, and also I am afraid to ask for a raise. 

Now my whole reaction is ridiculous, my father does not understand my depressIon, because I'm young and I'm somewhat successful by my age. But it's just like I have no future. I don't even want to try, I want to end things right now.

Also I will now talk about my past. My father was an alcoholic, but his is clean for more than 4 years now. My older sister has paranoidal schizophrenia. She stabbed my mother to death when I was 16 years old; now she is in a psychiatric hospital by court decision.

I am seeking opinions on what you would feel if you were in my position. Sometimes I do feel he does love me but when he is stressed and his anxiety is high, he is so on edge that he explodes (verbally) on me since I am the one that is right there/closest to him. When he calms down, he feels bad about what he said (I think he does).

The situation he is dealing with now is both parents have cancer, and as of overnight, both are terminal. One parent was not the ideal parent to anyone and the other did the best they could and fiancé is close to that one.

My (38f) fiancé (40m) have been having a lot of issues since basically the beginning of this year. But starting closer to what has been going on since June. I found out I had cancer the middle of June, didn’t know how or when to tell him (he won’t go to the dr with me) because his dad has terminal cancer and I didn’t know the extent of mine. Ended up telling him around the 10th of July (he called me a liar). He ended up buying me a car around this time, not sure of exact days but sold the one in his and my name and used that as a down payment (my credit is shot from my ex so I couldn’t be added to the loan).

Then the middle of July, I caught him talking bad about me (think of the worse thing someone you love could say and times it by 100) to another female and was having her sneak over with his words of “$€x” (hasn’t been with me since New Years). I got back home quickly to her, with no clothes on but he did, in my bed, where I usually sleep at!! This wasn’t some random person I didn’t know, him and I did mess around with her 2 years prior but agreed it was done and over with and won’t ever happen (with anyone) ever again.

He ended up gaslighting me on that situation. Blamed me for “bringing her into the house” (was somewhat still friends with her before this incident) and made to feel like it was my fault she didn’t want to talk to him again. Also, when him and I were messing with her, she mostly stopped it because she said he cornered her, grabbed and kissed her, and made her feel violated and she said she never wanted to be alone with him again. I never told him this until after the July incident to save him some humiliation (she said she liked it rough and he was “taking control”).

Him and I talked about it and he said he didn’t remember us agreeing to “done and over with and never anyone else” from a few years back. I got out what I got out, we talked a whole lot. I ended up telling him we can work this out, I can eventually forgive but it will take time and I will never forget. Moving on, I found out the cancer I had was in all my reproductive organs (I also found out I had endometriosis on top of PCOS) and I would be having surgery in Sept. He also was injured and had a Sept surgery.
Before his surgery at the beginning of Sept, a “close friend” of his moved in temp to help since I was scheduled for major surgery also and to help with fiancés needs while I was at work (fiancé has medical benefits from his job, I didn’t).

Fiancé had surgery, I went with him early in the am, stayed at the hospital the whole 7 hours he was there, waiting in a waiting room. His “friend” didn’t help with anything while he was there for 2 weeks except maybe $200 in groceries that he ended up eating 90% of them. I asked his friend for 3 days in a row to do one small thing for me a day (example: dishes, trash, water animals, sweep). He didn’t do anything I asked him to do. Fiancé got mad at me thinking I was just leaving things/not cleaning house. Fiancé left for a little bit and his “friend” asked me what was wrong. I told him. He said he “forgot” to do the things I asked and apologized, saying he will help more.

Fiancé came home and the dude straight up told fiancé “I never heard her say anything”, and basically said I never said anything needed done. His “friend” ended up having a complete crazy spell and I had to drive him to a mental health facility (“friend” was acting scared of fiancé and fiancé was highly irritated so I did it to make things easier). Well for the “fun” part, “friend” ended up calling 911 while I was driving (told me it was someone else). He answered a lot of yes and no questions and I was suspicious of things and he was still panicking so I was pointing out where we were at and where we were going and how he said he wanted me to take him there multiple times.

After driving for about an hour, I get pulled over. The crazy dude ended up saying yes and no to 911 and they got it as, he was being “stolen” by someone he didn’t know and doesn’t know where he is going but heard me in the background and knew something was afoul. They ended up taking him on an involuntary crazy hold and when they got him out the passenger seat and patted him down to take him into custody, he had a huge 🔪 of mine hidden in his pocket. The guy was going to hurt me, told me and the officers (while cuffed) he was going to hurt me. Police take him, I told fiancé what happened, fiancé mad at the “friend” now and tells me that the guy was nothing like what he was this time (hasn’t seen each other in 4+ years).

Moving closer to my surgery date. Fiancé goes with me to a dr appt because he didn’t believe that I actually had cancer!! He stayed in the waiting room though so I was confused on how that made him believe me but he said he did. Surgery day, I drove to the hospital, he didn’t want to leave that early, had my surgery, woke up in a room and he was there. Said he was there for about an hour (nurse told me he was only there for 30 minutes). I believed the nurse because the dr called him when my surgery was done to tell him how it went and it takes about 30 to get to the hospital. Time line adds up to him not being there but 30 minutes. Plus since the July incident, we have cameras (had them for years) and I could see when he left the house. But he ended up leaving within 15 minutes of me waking up, saying he was tired and wanted to sleep but couldn’t get comfortable at the hospital. He ended up going him and watching p0rn (by this time only done anything with me 3 times this whole year and wouldn’t do anything with me when I tried before surgery).

He is on medication that he blames ED on, yet he only has ED when it comes to me. He can self-pleasure perfectly fine, told female from July he has wanted to have $€x for so long but hasn’t with me. He does stand at attention when I do things, but he has me stop, saying “it isnt hard”, yet I can see and feel that it is. He has now told me that it is a turn off with me wanting $€x. Has also said recently to me he can’t stand me touching him. Hell it seems he doesn’t even want me in the same room as him!!

Onto October, we talked a lot more, ended up actually having a break through moment and did mostly better. Argued a little less and him and I both got to express feelings and things. But did have some pretty bad moments. He now tells me anytime we argue that it isn’t his fault I had things ripped out of me and I am emotional and have been a b!+{h ever since. Blames my feelings on my hormones and says I always have an attitude (I don’t). Been having arguments off and on since all this and things have been said that shouldn’t have (one point it was said “go ✂️ your wrists some more”).

Well onto today, another argument. I have been told multiple times this year that he can’t stand me, hates me, multiple names (b!+{h, wh0r€), I  need to move out, he doesn’t need me, he can have another female in the house faster than I can think (hours), that I have a boyfriend/am cheating on him (never have and never would), that I am nothing to him, he doesn’t care about me or love me, and a whole lot more. My self-esteem was never that good but was getting better as I get older, but with his words, it has gone back to bad. He keeps saying I have nothing, have done nothing to contribute to the house or to him, and that he doesn’t care/thinks it is funny I would be homeless. Told me the car he bought is mine, yet says it isn’t my name on it and he will sell it before he lets me have it. Has said he would never marry me, why would someone want to marry me and has made comments about my va-jay-jay, (smelly and nasty looking), weight (fat and nasty), and other things just to hurt my feelings. I shower everyday and make sure I don’t stink and am clean. Said that is a defense mechanism he has.

Since July, I have been watching our security cameras more to reassure myself he isn’t lying or cheating. Found out by watching he lied to me everyday. He lies about things that are huge/major things down to how long he has been up for/what he was watching on tv (without me asking!!!). His parents (according to him) don’t know why I treat him badly (I don’t, I even cut his steak up in bite size pieces, make his plate, clean house and basically pamper him and treat him like a King). He lies about even talking to them!! Fiancé has the old school beliefs that women are supposed to keep the house in order and keep it clean and men work and don’t clean/do much at home. Our house is almost always clean (I may go a day being lazy but usually am on top of things). I work 40 hours a week, sometimes more. He was off work for multiple months for his injury, I went to work the day after my surgery (ended up having to go home and take another day).

For some reason, typing this out and experiencing it first hand, I will still say I love him (he doesn’t say it back much). If we do split, I have no car (he told me he made sure he had a backup plan if we split since we got together), no place to live (he said the landlord doesn’t want to deal with me and that he made sure I wouldn’t stay there), I would lose my job also (no car). He has told me he would sign a paper (notarized) that I keep car and make payments, miss one and he takes car away if something happened between us. But when asked if he would meet to get it notarized, he says he would never sign that and I will never get the car.

I am so broken down that I hope something happens to me to 🔚🎬 it all (I have severe depression and $u!{id@l tendencies/thoughts, that he knows and uses against me). I am put down so much, I feel he is stuck with me (in a little debt right now, together). I feel so bad about myself and so ugly, that I don’t know what to do. All I want is to be happy with him (and him be happy with me), but I don’t think that will ever happen. I know most will tell me to leave him but when times are good, they are good. The bad times, lately at least, have been during very stressful times (more bills than money, sick/terminal family members, outside forces).

He has never laid a finger on me in anger but does threaten it. I have told him multiple times I wish he would because physical hurts less than mental/verbal. Words damage more than actions sometimes. When I tell him that he say I need to stop being a little b!+{h and I need to grow up. He (most of the time) apologizes for how he acted then says it was me that started it. But it has gotten to the point where he thinks anytime I speak, it is to argue with him or that I have an attitude, or I made a face, or I scoffed/huffed and puffed and none of that is true!! He has said that i am conspiring against him, plotting and scheming against him and things like that.

All I have done to this man is be nothing but nice and caring and loving. Telling him I am there for him if he wants or needs anything. Offer to get him anything he wants (that I can get) and I have even stopped everything $€xu@l towards him (have now had $€x 5 times total this year with him). He says all I want is $€x, that I am a nymph0 (he knew I was a very $€xu@l person when we first got together). Anytime I touch him, he thinks/gets mad at me thinking that I am wanting/trying to do $€xu@l things even though I stopped trying.

I touched him today on his side (he is going through family issues and didn’t feel good) and he tells me he isn’t “in the mood”. I ask him what he meant by that and he got madder and told me to stop bothering him and leave and how he can’t wait until I am gone.

He says (sometimes) he does love me and if he didn’t want me there, I wouldn’t be there. But I just feel like crap because of what he says to me. Words✂️ worse than anything and I am✂️ deeper than ever. I feel he is only with me just to have someone there when he wants/is ready. And I have told him I felt more like a roommate than a partner. I don’t feel like he actually does love me anymore even though he says if he didn’t I wouldn’t be there (in the house with him). But we never go anywhere together (he says it is a financial reason and it isn’t), don’t really do anything $€xu@l (unless he wants to with me, rarely does).

He says he isn’t the “lovey-dovey” type yet he is sometimes and was for the first few years we were together. We can’t even cuddle and watch a movie because he doesn’t want to, ever. It feels like he only wants a relationship when it is convenient for him and that our relationship is on roommate status until he want a fiancé relationship. I don’t think he ever wanted to marry me but also ask myself if he didn’t he wouldn’t have gone with me dress shopping (I asked him to). And he does want/cares about me because he did buy me a car and does other things here and there for me. But I also feel that the “relationship” is one sided mostly, I put in 100% and he puts in maybe 3% (when convenient for him). He doesn’t even really go out in public with me anymore.

I have even written a letter (around end of Sept) to him in regards to how I feel and how I just want him to be happy and his happiness is obviously not with me, type of letter/breakup letter. I never have it to him but I still have it. I have never actually put it all together like I did here and don’t really have anyone to talk to about things so I keep it all in mostly. I am on meds now for depression and other things.

I just think that I will never have the happy relationship/happily ever after that every girl dreams of and that I don’t deserve it. I haven’t done anything wrong that would make me think “I deserve to be sad and alone the rest of my life”. I love helping people and would do pretty much anything to make a person smile/brighten someone’s day. I am a people pleaser so badly that I sacrifice my own needs/wants for others all the time, every day. I have been physically, mentally/verbally @bu$€d by my ex for many years and most of my childhood (was also abused in the worst possible way). That abuse has caused a lot of problems as it always does. But I am still here and standing. I just wish that I made people as happy as I could. I can’t stand the idea that someone is miserable just because I am around them. 

If you made it all the way through, thank you. I appreciate your time to read my post. But I will also say, I won’t leave him. I won’t give up on his and my relationship because I do think it is worth it. Like I did say before, the good times are good. Stress has caused most of the recent issues and him thinking I am against him comes from being mistreated by his mother and issues with her which are ongoing.

Most of the time, I am confused about why he is angry towards me because I didn’t do anything. I am not here saying I am the most innocent person ever, I do have my flaws but most of the time, I am the easiest person to get along with. I am mostly a push-over but hold everything in until I explode which usually happens by the time he calls me the 3 derogatory name. I now will tell him “fu(k yo0” while walking about (usually by this time I yell it over and over again). Because he says such bad things to/about me, that I would rather scream that over his words now.

And his best defense is to always attack my past intimate partners and my weight (I am over 250 but have lost some weight where he is over 300 and has gained a significant amount where his clothes do not fit him anymore). He expects most things to be instantaneous (order something and it should be there by the next day, get him something, or fix something that is out of my control) and gets mad when it isn’t or if I can’t do it/answer/solve the problem.

He has mental issues (bi-polar, anxiety, PTSD, ect) and uses it as an excuse for his behavior/actions/words. When he is upset/mad/frustrated over anything/anyone, he takes it out on me even when I didn’t cause the issue. He doesn’t really “talk things out” with me, he just gets mad and angry. I am not making excuses for his behavior but I do know he is going through a lot (parents both have cancer and one is terminal and the other is up in the air on and is selfish and was not a good parent).

But to me, you don’t punish the one who is next to you for someone else’s actions. You don’t treat someone you love the way he is treating me, and I have said this to him too. I don’t think anyone should be treated the way he treats me but at the end of the day, I still and always will love him. He has actually helped me stand up for myself (usually against him and his words) and has shown me actual love but I don’t feel like he still loves me. Or it is the saying “I still love you but I am not in love with you” on his part.

Obligatory TL;DR: fiancé is mean/verbally @bu$I’ve then apologizes later and says he needs me. Also seems more like a roommate than partner but according to him, I am wrong. I am lost and confused on if he truly loves me or doesn’t care about me/us.",1701721955.0,

but afterwards I realised that it was weak of me to just back off and I should have responded in equal or more tone. sometimes I think it was mature of me to not push it further because it was just a few cents and I really didn't want an altercation with a salesperson over that. and at the same time I feel that I was disrespected and I didn't do anything. 
and everyone I share this with fail to recognise the problem, they say why are you losing it over a few cents and that's true. but the fact is it's not a few cents but rather the manner in which he responded and I didn't expect him to respond in such a way. 
this happens alot and I get fixated on small stupid altercations that my friends say are frankly not to be bothered about.

hi all, hope everyone is okay!!

im just coming on here because recently i’ve been struggling to keep my anxiety under control. i think i’ve been struggling especially the last 2 months but it’s been really bad the past few days. and unfortunately i just kept on breaking down during my shift at work the other day.

now i’m writing this post because i can tell the reactions of people when i go into work next week, of people asking me if i’m ok, trying to baby me, trying to make me feel better and in actuality not helping me feel better. i can feel people will just be constantly checking up on me which i appreciate but it’s not what i want, i just want to feel capable and that i’m good enough not comforted and treated like a kid. how do i communicate this with people without coming across harsh and not sounding ungrateful for their help.",1701686627.0,

I feel my head empty, like there is absolutely nothing in there, just spiderwebs and tumbleweeds rolling around. I don’t understand how I’m functioning  
  
I used to be able to communicate with people, now I just want to be swallowed up by the ground whenever I see one, let alone when I have to interact with someone. It’s not fun when you have to say something and your brain just throws random words really fast, but my mouth can’t keep up with them, so I’m just stuttering and mumbling whatever I can and that leads to awkward situations. Even now, writing this is so difficult, finding those lost words in the dark ocean feels impossible.   
I truly don’t know what I’m good at, what to do to be a useful member of society. I feel so stupid, I feel so much fear, anxiety, numbness, cold, it’s like I am drowning in a cold and dark lake, being held by some weird entity that no matter how much I struggle, it just won’t let me go.   
  
I see all these people who have it so much harder than me, struggling at work, struggling because of lack of work, abuse at home, at work, financial problems, family problems, and then, there’s me. I have so much to be grateful for, I have so many loved ones that support and love me to be grateful for, I have a roof over my head, financially I am struggling a bit, it’s true (but don’t we all these days), I have a job, I travel once a year, but here I am constantly whining and struggling for some reason.

Does anyone else have so much crippling anxiety that it just keeps you from getting out of bed or leaving the house? 

I'm in my 30's, and I've been trying so hard to handle a regular 9-5 for many years. My first boss understood my trouble and accommodated me by letting me have a flexible start time. At the time I was the keyholder, but she quickly made the conclusion to include another staff to open shop with me. While that sort of worked well, the hours were no good for my depression  and I basically would spend my off hours in bed.

After that, I moved back to my hometown and I haven't been as lucky since. After the initial honeymoon period at a workplace, I always seem to have one thing or another not work right with me - lack of motivation, physical discomforts and panic attacks. I can find a job fine, but my only flaw is not being able to be present or show up. I am in therapy and taking medication, but I'm struggling with time management? Being on time? I don't know what it is. Eventually, this pattern ends with me doing no shows because my system is just so overwhelmed.

Things that have helped so far is disclosing the fact that I have trouble with mornings, trying to communicate when I'm late, and just minimizing my work hours. But even then, it's just not enough. When I go through the smallest transition, it's like I have to fight through this cycle again.

Begged my dr to please just give me the lorazepam so I could avoid withdrawal. She refused. I found another doctor who was willing to refill it but in that week period my anxiety has resurfaced so badly. I now have severe agoraphobia which I haven’t experienced in 8 years. I made myself leave yesterday and everything was ok but everyday I just dread leaving. I lost my job. My relationship is suffering, they are so supportive but the financial stress is getting to them. I have no family here. How do I overcome this again? Last time it took nearly 2 months for me to be okay again. I don’t have that luxury. Any tips or tricks on what helped you?

Glorythewizard1485,Diagnose me,1,187ym1h,1,"I want to talk about something and take advice, psychologically, behaviorally, whatever, what is it? So, about 3 months ago I tried to commit suicide. A year ago, I went to a doctor to get psychological advice after my situation got very bad. I always tried to ignore it, I always had suicidal thoughts, nightmares about suicide, and in the dreams my father always shouted at me after the suicide. He blames me for distracting them with my triviality. This is in my dreams. Before that, when a knife was pointed at me, that was my only fear, that I would not die. And my life gets worse. These were nightmares and thoughts from childhood. And with many other details about depression. And actual self-harm to various parts of my body, especially the invisible ones. I didn't really care about all of that. I went through many bouts of madness that almost made my head explode. I went to counseling at the age of 20 after my eating disorder reached its limits. I tried to hide it a lot, but every time I forced myself to eat, I would vomit. I lost a lot of weight. I used to hide it with clothes until people near and far around me began to notice, despite my attempts not to show it. I started taking medication only without psychological treatment, general medication, S.O.S medication for panic cases and severe relapses, and medication for sleep disorders. I reached the maximum dose until my condition began to stabilize and the effect of the S.OS medication began to diminish. I don't know how I reached suicide, but I did. I took about 70 pills that I had. Before that, I had a heated argument with my family. It seemed that they felt something was wrong when my mother came to continue the fight with me. I don't remember much, but I vomited and was put in the shower. I just remember that I wanted to sleep, I was very tired. My whole body was burning from the medicine. My throat, my nose. He did not allow me to sleep. I was subjected to severe violence when my father found out. I don't know what their logic is, but when abused, the attacker is the one who benefits. This was always their way of taking advantage when they did not know how to deal with situations. Human punching bag. The point is, I ended up getting the exact same bruises I was getting in my nightmares from my father after the suicide attempt. I was not admitted to the hospital. I have been recovering for two months. I had severe mood swings last month. The thing is, I don't cry. I do not feel. I didn't think the topic was important. Even when I was being crushed and beaten half to death, the effects were still there. I didn't cry. In fact, I stopped crying at some point in my life while I was being beaten. I feel empty. Empty. Empty. Trivial. Rusted. I do not feel. I don't cry enough. I never received proper medical advice. The doctor you went to didn't care about the medication or the external symptoms. My first and only consultation, I was not allowed to say more than my physical symptoms and it ended quickly. I don't know the average consultation time, but it was less than half an hour. I want to understand what this is?",1701392295.0,
MrNeverEverKnew,Give me reasons to not worry about daily Pregabalin,1,187wvog,0,"I got Pregabalin prescribed at 150mg for if needed.

I’m struggling so so so hard due to severe treatment-resistant depression and social anxiety and ADD-symptoms in my life. Life is hell and everyday a new fight of just surviving the day for itself - for years - since I‘m 13 - now 23.

As Pregabalin works very well on days when I take it (at least until it wears off) I know Pregabalin helps my situation in almost most aspects but I have SO much anxiety about taking it daily knowing about its possible tolerance, dependance and withdrawal issues.

Right now, I, dumb as I was, got back to Kratom again and take it daily for almost 2 weeks now. I lost and lose a lot of weight as Kratom makes my appetite and hunger disappear completely (not exaggerating) for hours. I probably eat 500cal a day in average when using Kratom but some days itself it might be less or almost nothing due to Kratom‘s incredible appetize-killing effects and me thinking to always keep an empty stomach for dosing Kratom (as it will work best on empty stomach, dumb I know - but here you can see how desperate I truly am for a at least a tiny little bit good or stable mood - offering the filling of my stomach when hungry and by that my physical health in payment for).

I now see that Kratom is ofc giving me relief of my mental illness and symptoms (depression, anxiety, ADD), but in contrast only way too short for its high costs: 20 minutes of depression relief and high motivation/focus but takes too much of my mental health (dependance, causing depression and strong anhedonia, finally feeling okay but also feeling 24/7 okay with straight just doing nothing than laying in bed bingeing on smartphone) as well as physical health (not eating for days, drinking very little and extremely increasing physical anxiety symptoms).

Why I still take kratom is because as the typical „it‘s just a natural plant“ always brings me to the thought that using that for days in a row is just less harming than using Pregabalin which „hey it‘s bad it‘s a chemical“. 

But in fact not regarding chemical or natural I truly live a MUCH more healthier life on Pregabalin: I get out of bed, wake up, get out of my room, shower, cook for myself, eat, brush teeth, get out of my apartment into fresh air, meet friends, get to know new people, experience new things, have feelings of joy, enjoying life and thankfulness. I do live. I DONT do all these things (no joke) on Kratom.

Looking at this way you would say CLEAR THING if you have to pick a poison of one of these two it definitely 2.000.000% is Pregabalin. But for me Kratom still seems as the „oh it‘s just a plant and natural and by that just harmless thing“ (even if I had very bad withdrawals from Kratom while never from Pregabalin) so I always pick Kratom most days hoping to keep Pregabalin low in use as only if needed while I keep my Kratom dose on a regular mid which (as I already know) brings me into dependance and withdrawal.

Now I‘ve been on 4 days Kratom (5-10gpd) again since last Pregabalin use and think about just giving up Kratom and only use Pregabalin so I can finally eat again and gain weight, get outside, meet people and enjoy and live at least a little bit of this thing called life. Still I always this voice in myself talks to me very loud BETTER TAKE KRATOM THAN PREGABALIN ITS SAFER. But I very clearly see Kratom brings me a lot of harm physical as well as mental while Pregabalin never does or did (while I‘m still ofc very very very anxious about dependance and withdrawal when I should decide to be using it daily).

Please tell me what to do. Even on days when I take Pregabalin my addicted brain gets myself to use a little bit of Kratom because my addiction to it is so harf as it seems but then only 2 to max 5gpd instead of the usual 10-15gpd. 

My aim really is to get the hell out off of kratom. But even if I not do much on and with Kratom without it I wouldn’t do anything for my university courses and seminars and exams. I wouldn‘t have got to my second last semester of Master without the help of kratom. University obligations might even be one of the most biggest arguments for me always continue on using Kratom.

I also got prescribed Wellbutrin (Bupropion) 150mg now by my doc who also prescribed me the  pregabalin 150mg as needed. Ofc she doesn’t know about my kratom use. I don‘t know what to do.

Any suggestions, experience stories or assumptions very welcome. 

I guess the main is about rather continue Kratom or Pregabalin for the next few days in my situation and regarding my experiences of effects and experiences with each ones.

I just know on Pregabalin instead of Kratom I would eat again (and not lose weight until being skinny as a dead stick), get out of bed, move my body, do sports, meet friends and have some feelings of joy, future appreciation and plans and bliss in my life. Only thing always kept me away from it is NEVER TAKE PREGABALIN DAILY and PREGABALIN WAY DANGEROUS THAN KRATOM.",1701387639.0,
TheDalaiDrama,From physical to mental stress - am I going crazy,3,187jgeh,3,"From physical to mental anxiety - am I going crazy?

I find myself in a strange place. Initially, my anxiety was predominantly physical – the racing heart, shallow breaths, and tense muscles. But lately, it seems like my anxiety has evolved into something more insidious, a constant mental presence that I can't shake off.

 I still feel those heart palpitations and sometimes it seems to me they reach my brain and make me feel in a constant mental stress.

It's like living in a state of perpetual anxiety, where my mind is constantly racing and I wonder many times if I am going crazy or mentally unstable. The constant barrage of anxious thoughts makes me question my sanity.

In that time, l've:  
• Been physically active  
• Worked with a therapist weekly  
• Received an extension on medical leave
• Talked to a psychiatrist  
• Been prescribed Lexapro (5mg), the side effects kicked my butt for 3 weeks (varied degrees of symptoms)  
• Scheduled a meet with a Psychologist to do Neuropsychiatric Testing to determine if i have ADHD (January 19th)  
• Been told to taper off of Lexapro and prescription switched to Zoloft (25mg)  

I am supposed to return to work this coming Wednesday (11/29), but considering how i responded to the Lexapro, my anxiety is building a lot as i am about to begin taking Zoloft. With the side effects i was encountering while on Lexapro, i definitely would not have been able to perform work tasks.  

There's no denying that I've been making the effort to take care of my mental health in order to return to work, it's not as if I'm just milking my medical leave.  

I meet with my psychiatrist tomorrow and I'm thinking of asking for an extension on my leave for another month and a half (i was given a 30-day supply of Zoloft) or two months to deal with potential side effects and have the medication kick into full-effect... I was teeter-tottering on whether or not i was ready to return to work, but i can now say that i am not ready.  

Would it be wrong for me to ask for another extension on my leave? Do i have a valid reason to?

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Crazy everywhere;  
Wrestling through the crowd, getting knocked to the ground  
All to find the gift that shows you care.  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Packed in every store  
But the scariest sight to see is the people that will be  
At your own front door.

  
They’ll be coming to visit and soon you will fidget  
You can’t stand any of them;  
You’re tired of talk and go for a walk  
In the hope of buying some Gin;  
And Mom and Dad can’t find you and they wonder where you’ve been.

  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go;  
Can’t find a cheap Hotel, parking is really hell,  
The shopping crowds, yeah, they really blow.  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;  
Soon the headaches start.  
And the thing that will make it throb is the panic as you sob  
Right within your heart!

EERMA,Are You an Introvert with Anxiety?,8,184heaj,0,"Anxiety. That emotion warning us something threatening is just about to happen. Life-saving when we are genuinely threatened, damaging when we become constantly anxious: anxiety is tiring – it is meant to be. We are only meant to be anxious for very short periods. When prolonged, it isn’t just tiring – it is exhausting. Sound familiar?   
  
Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We prefer to re-charge on our own. We often enjoy losing ourselves in our own thoughts. We tend to have small, close-knit, social lives. That doesn’t mean we’re anti-social!  
  
Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. Many introverts deal with anxiety, though, so this is quite common.  
  
Here are the key signs you’re an introvert with anxiety:  
  
•	You’re more prepared than most others because you’ve already thought through the worst-case scenarios.  
•	You have a tendency to over-think things and pay too much attention to your negative self-talk.  
•	You feel you always have to be doing something – being busy (which is often different from being effective) may be a means of trying to cope with the anxiety.  
•	You tend to prefer routines to novel situations. While this can be fine for periods, boredom and unexpected issues arising can easily throw you in to a spin.  
•	You’re often nervous without showing it – many become very effective at masking their emotions as a defence mechanism.     
•	You are more likely to perceive situations as being more dangerous than they really are - anxiety primes us for the fight, flight, freeze response making us more likely to over-react to a low-risk situation.  
•	You have tendencies towards perfectionism. This is often allied to beliefs such as ‘I need to please everyone’, ‘I need everyone to like me to be a worthy person’.  
•	Nervousness can throw your chatter in to over-drive: while you normally only speak when you have something significant to say (and you’re normally sure of your facts before speaking), nerves can have you chattering away in an attempt to over-compensate.  
•	You often have trouble sleeping – either getting to sleep a-tall, waking through the night or waking way too early   
  
Being an introvert with anxiety can be hard. Thankfully there is help at hand. Anxiety in its many guises is one of the most common issues Solution Focused Hypnotherapy therapists help people with.

It seems to have improved my depression tremendously, but with that gone I’ve been an anxious wreck. Since i started my meds I’ve frequently upset people through my high strung mindset, as i’m unable to reign in delusions brought on by the anxiety.

I am presently on 40mg of fluoxetine and 150mg of bupropion per day. I’m going to talk to my therapist and doctor about these issues, and ask about finding some sort of relaxant that will make me less anxious. But I want to be prepared and well-informed before i go into these conversations, so here is what i want insight with:

is there medication that anyone has found to work well/not work well with fluoxetine and bupropion for anxiety? I’d like to read up on meds my doctor may suggest so the conversation can be more productive in narrowing down what might work for me.

thank you!!",1701030329.0,

I’ve taken steps to help treat my anxiety but I’m finding I’m really starting to struggle in customer facing roles and feel like I need a job much better suited to introverts. 
I was fired from my last role in a call centre due my anxiety having a huge factor and now I’m a receptionist for an industry I’ve never worked in before. 
My issue is all my relevant experience is customer facing jobs and I have no relevant qualifications that could help me get a “less customer interactive role” if that makes sense.

,Did I permanently damage my relationship with my coworker?,1,184kemt,0,"To start off, I started this job October. This is my first job after graduating, and I really like it. It's a small company with 40 people and everyone is friends with each other (owners own words). I wanted to be a part of that too, but I ended up trying too hard and pushed people away. First, I felt insecure and anxious by asking if ""everyone hates me"" and I kept asking for feedback on ""how am I fitting in socially and culturally."" This got back to the owner (who is also HR), and he was concerned about me. He felt like I was causing a distraction to others, preventing others from becoming successful, and caused others not to enjoy working with me. In a nutshell, people were becoming uncomfortable and distracted about my constant need for reassurance. It was truly not my intention to do any of that, I just saw how everyone else was fitting in and I wanted to be a part of that too. After a little while, the owner forced me to go on leave. First, he told me to take 2 weeks off, but he is now telling me until January 2nd.  
What pushed him to put me on leave is that I said an inappropriate joke to a co-worker named L. I was talking to my sister on the phone a few weeks ago and she was asking me about work and everyone who works there and I told her ""well there's these 4 guys who went to high school and college together...."" and she was like ""are they gay?"" (have nothing against gay people, we just thought it was funny that those 4 guys who have been schooling together their whole life are now working together) and I told this joke to one of those 4 guys. I didn't think through the repercussions or how it would make him feel, but from what I heard, he felt uncomfortable. He told the owner, the owner talked to me, and he even though he knows it wasn't my intention to be hurtful, he felt like I was trying to hard. He felt like my anxiety of wanting to fit in and be liked caused me to not be aware of what I was saying. What I think also pushed him to put me on leave is when i asked the owner those same questions for reassurance such as if everyone hates me.   
Again, it wasn't my intention to hurt his feelings or be offensive. I didn't think it through and I made a mistake and I regret it deeply. I even tried apologizing, but I got no response. Before hand, I would also ask him for reassurance as well. I would also message him just for social talk and he would be nice to me and responsive. But after I said that joke, I can tell he was upset because he stopped responding. From what I learned when L told the owner about what's going on, the owner told me that L felt like I was coming on too strong and that I shared too many personal details with him. I tried apologizing, but no response to that either. Did I ruin my chances for friendship with this person? Do you think I can fix this once I come back?  
I started anti-anxiety medication and therapy as well.  
Lastly, should I go back to work for the same company in January if the owner says I can? Or did I cause too much damage? Do you think these next weeks are enough time to give people space and forget about this? I just feel worried if I come back, everyone will not want me there or want anything to do with me because of the things that happened, despite my improvement in fixing them.",1701031672.0,
ConJack93,Is loneliness really so bad?,7,183ur2h,2,"Here I am typing this as a 30 year old lad, in a packed bar having a few drinks. No problem right? Only thing is though that I’m sitting drinking by myself. 

People keep telling me that I must get out there and live my life. That’s exactly what I’m doing - the thing is that I’m living it by myself, which fills me with dread, despair, depression, sadness and anger. 

Hundreds of people in this bar, of all ages, all in groups having a great time with each other. Then there’s me. I should enjoy my own company apparently, but it’s hard when I crave human connection and companionship.  

I realise I’m just feeling sorry for myself and I know life could be worse, however 30 years of simply just being myself has resulted in having one good friend and limited family connections. I can go weeks without any contact from anyone. 

I just want to know if life can get any better from here. I’m 30. I don’t want to be 40 and alone. I’ve heard it becomes more difficult to meet people as you get older… but it was already impossible in my 20s. I just want to know there is hope, otherwise there is no point anymore.

EERMA,What If You’re Doing Better Than You Think?,2,1830s40,1,"It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.  
  
  
Consider these positive signs:  
  
•	You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors. You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes  
  
•	You’re clear on what you want – and why. Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.  
  
•	You use time wisely. We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now.    
  
•	You’re making consistent progress. Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.  
  
•	You’re not alone. There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.  
  
•	You’re committed. You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.  
  
•	You consider other’s opinions. You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs.   
  
•	You are grateful. You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.  
  
•	You’re authentic. You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.  
  
  
When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

Regular_Prize1587,Anxiety? Someone help me understand what’s going on.,1,180xsr0,0,"This is going to be a long story, if you read all the way through bless you. 

To begin, I’m a 24 year old female living with my boyfriend. I have had anxiety my entire life. I was diagnosed around 16 and was put on celexa to manage.

 About three months into taking celexa I had a horrible anaphylactic reaction that caused my airway to close and I was rushed to the ER and basically couldn’t breathe for about 3 minutes in total. This may not seem like a huge deal but looking back now I feel like it started my huge spiral into where I am now. 

Fast forward about 8 years and here I am now. I’ve been managing my anxiety completely alone without medication or therapy and I’ve been ok. Of course I have anxious days but nothing I couldn’t handle and I still had joy in doing things. 

About a month ago I found out I was finally accepted into nursing school and as happy I was, I feel like it caused my entire mental health to collapse. I’m not sure if it is because of anticipation/nervousness/ afraid to fail but ever since then, I have not been the same.

I have never been the best sleeper in the world but I never felt it was an “issue”. Over the past few weeks I have hardly slept. To the point where my eyelids felt heavy the next day. On top of that, I have the strangest feeling that I can’t begin to explain…it’s like anxiety but it weighs 30lbs more and it makes me feel like  life isn’t real? Like what I’m experiencing is fake.. it’s like I start thinking about how things don’t feel right and then I start spiraling and I get this sinking feeling in my chest in heart and it won’t stop. It used to only be at night but now it hits me out of nowhere in the middle of my workday and it feels debilitating. I know that sounds crazy but whenever I can’t distract myself it just creeps on me and consumes me whole. I sit in bed at night and feel just hopeless. It feels like I’ll never be myself again and I’ll just keep getting worse and worse until I finally go into full blown psychosis. (I know that’s an overreaction but genuinely that’s how I feel). My voice in my head feels loud and overwhelming and like I can’t control it and it’s a scary feeling. 

On top of that, because of my history with anaphylaxis, every night when I try to go to bed and lay down, I’m struck with this feeling of not being about to breathe. I know deep down it’s my anxiety but it’s completely taking over my life. It feels like I’m going to die at any minute all the time and it’s so scary and terrifying but I sound so dumb when I try to say how I’m feeling out loud. 

With everything going on in my head, I knew it was finally time to seek out medical help. About 2 weeks ago I went to the doctor and they prescribed me trazadone for sleep and Xanax as an intermittent medication until my genesight testing came in and they can put me on something long term. 

The trazadone helps a bit with my sleep but doesn’t help me when I feel like I can’t breathe and the Xanax I haven’t really used beside one time when I split it in half and it did help me to calm down and sleep. 

My doctor called me today and told me they got my genesight back and want me to take bupropion XL 150mg everyday. 

I guess I have three questions if anyone out there can help. I’m sorry this message was all over the place but that’s just how my mind has been feeling. 

1. Does anyone know if the bupropion will truly help me? Because of my past experience with medications I am terrified beyond believe to try anything new. The trazadone took me a week to start taking and about 16 google searches on the safety of the medication. 

2. Has anyone felt like this and gotten out? I feel like this is never going to end. I wake up everyday hopeless. I just want to be me again. Is this anxiety? Is it depression? I feel like I have like some undiagnosed mental disorder that is just going to keep getting worse until there’s nothing left of me. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. How did you make it stop can I get back to being me? I know it’s only been a month but it feels like it’s been going on forever. 

3. How do I get over my fear of dying. I don’t know why I’m so afraid. I never used to think about death like I have the past month and I really don’t understand what’s triggered me. I’ve tried to think and sort through my emotions but nothing really has changed in my life besides getting into nursing school which is such a good thing, I don’t know why I feel like it’s causing all of this.

My grandmother's passing was more complicated, i wont really get into it but she succumbed to an infection last year. the woman was warm and gentle and funny and i wasn't with her towards the end and she would call and ask when i was coming home and i would just brush it off. and i will probably never forget i did that to her. i moved in with my mom and that was that.

,Not leaving room when other house guests are here.,5,17zc0iu,1,"So I have had a place of my own once, I'm 22. Growing up I always stayed in my room, it's always been a safe space for me, and when there were other guests or family over, I would NOT leave my room. I got to a point of being so uncomfortable in my home, I kept food in my room and didn't leave it until I had to use the restroom which was easy because It was right in the hallway next to my room. Everywhere I've been, it's been like this. No matter how friendly or how welcomed I feel. 
Well tonight, there's people here, I'm rooming with my friend and I like everyone...my clothes are in the drier, I'm having a horrible mental health moment, and part of my plan of coping is to take a nice hot shower, then watch some anime...and guess what...my towel is in the drier...the door is extremely loud when I open it and for some reason the anticipation of opening this door to do what I need to do is making me feel helpless and so out of control. 
I just want a nice shower, with my amazing shampoo, my favorite pj's and to get into bed and just continue my business. It's just so frustrating feeling unsafe. 
Like the only thing bad that can really happen is that I have to put on a mask when I just don't want to interact right now.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety-depression disorder, although I am high functioning and not taking medicine. Before taking drugs, I would feel so much the need to try with these.

,Will I go back to work? Is it too late to fix my relationships with my coworkers? Should I go back to work at the same place?,1,17xtxb6,1,"Hi everyone,  
To start off, I started this job October 2nd. This is my first job after graduating, and I really like it. It's a small company with 40 people and everyone is friends with each other. I wanted to be a part of that too, but I ended up trying too hard and pushed people away. First, I felt insecure and anxious by asking if ""everyone hates me"" and I kept asking for feedback on ""how am I fitting in socially and culturally."" This got back to the owner (who is also HR), and he was concerned about me. He felt like I was causing a distraction to others, preventing others from becoming successful, and caused others not to enjoy working with me. In a nutshell, people were becoming uncomfortable and distracted about my constant need for reassurance. It was truly not my intention to do any of that, I just saw how everyone else was fitting in and I wanted to be a part of that too. After a little while, the owner forced me to go on leave. First, he told me to take 2 weeks off, but he is telling me until January 2nd.  
What pushed him to put me on leave is that I said an inappropriate joke to a co-worker. I was talking to my sister on the phone a few weeks ago and she was asking me about work and everyone who works there and I told her ""well there's these 4 guys who went to high school and college together...."" and she was like ""are they gay?"" ( have nothing against gay people, we just thought it was funny that those 4 guys who have been schooling together their whole life are now working together) and I told this joke to one of those 4 guys. I didn't think through the repercussions or how it would make him feel, but from what I heard, he felt uncomfortable. He told the owner, the owner talked to me, and he even though he knows it wasn't my intention to be hurtful, he felt like I was trying to hard. He felt like my anxiety of wanting to fit in and be liked caused me to not be aware of what I was saying. What I think also pushed him to put me on leave is when i asked the owner those same questions for reassurance such as if everyone hates me. I feel like if it were just about the joke, he just would've warned me not to do it again, but he saw my anxiety and intense desire to fit in was causing a problem. He told me I should seek some therapy and professional help so I can build a better foundation for myself, and that we will talk again January 2nd about the possibility of me coming back to work. I begged for him to keep me there because I really needed the money and I liked the job, but he said he didn't want to risk me causing any more distractions.  
To give more background, I was bullied and excluded a lot during my childhood. I never fit in or had any friends. Even in middle school, high school, and college. This is why I keep questioning if everyone hates me or not. This is also why I kept pushing for friendships so eagerly and so soon. I wanted that social interaction so bad. It sucks that I'm on leave too because I feel like I cut off my only opportunity for socializing and connecting with others, since I don't have any friends and don't go anywhere. I was always so happy in the morning to get up and go to work. I never felt that happiness before, but I can't for a while.  
I was also starting to make some friends there, but I shared too much too soon. There are a few people in particular: A, K, and L.  
With A, we were starting to be friends because we shared similar values. Before I was put on leave, I would ask her for reassurance if everyone hates me and would ask her for that feedback on how I'm fitting in. But ever since I was put on leave, I texted her constantly about the situation and was worried she wouldn't reply so it fueled my anxiety and I kept texting. I was scared if everyone was talking about me, if everyone hated me, etc. From what A told me, she felt uncomfortable about the multiple texts and felt like I threw a lot at her even though she has her own problems. She said she felt uncomfortable having these conversations because she reassured me enough and that she lost a lot of trust in me, and then she blocked me. It hurt me a lot. It fuels the feeling that she hates me. In everyones opinion, do you think I ruined this friendship? Does this person hate me? If I come back to work in January, do you think this can be fixed and I can rebuild that relationship and trust with them?  
With K, it's a little similar to A. We shared similar values, and was also talking to her constantly after my leave about the same things I mentioned to A. K is still supportive on me, but I can tell she is tired of it as well. Again, can this friendship be fixed once I come back?  
L was the one I told the inappropriate joke to. Again, it wasn't my intention to hurt his feelings or be offensive. I didn't think it through and I made a mistake and I regret it deeply. I even tried apologizing, but I got no response. Before hand, I would also ask him for reassurance as well. I would also message him just for social talk and he would be nice to me and responsive. But after I said that joke, I can tell he was upset because he stopped responding. From what I learned when L told the owner about what's going on, the owner told me that L felt like I was coming on too strong and that I shared too many personal details with him. The owner said L could see us being friends, but I was pushing it too hard. Did I ruin my chances for friendship with this person? Do you think I can fix this once I come back?  
Yesterday, I started weekly therapy sessions. Today, I started anti-anxiety medications. I am hoping and praying that it helps me.  
Lastly, should I go back to work for the same company in January if the owner says I can? Or did I cause too much damage? Do you think these next 7 weeks are enough time to give people space and forget about this? I just feel worried if I come back, everyone will not want me there or want anything to do with me because of the things that happened, despite my improvement in fixing them.  
This was also the email I got from the owner about my leave to give more people clarification and context:  
Hi,  
Thanks for talking with me on the phone today. I want you to know that I care about you, and want only the best for you. You have asked me repeatedly if everyone (teammates) hates you, and if everyone (teammates) doesn't want you here. I have tried to reassure you that I and everyone (here at the company) care about you, want you to be successful, and want you to help us all be successful.  
It seems like your fears combined with your intense desire to fit in and succeed have resulted in frequent email, slack and in person interactions with people at our company that have become counter productive for you and for our company to succeed. I (and several others) have attempted to talk with you and be helpful. Unfortunately, we do not have the skill or ability within our company to properly help you. You mentioned that you spoke with your sister about getting therapy. I also suggested that you ask a doctor about what kind of help may be available. You told me that you've had similar things happen to you in high school and in college. There is no doubt in my mind that you have the drive and determination to make changes, and I hope you can find professional guidance and feedback to show you the way.  
I sincerely hope that you can get the help that you need.  
Next steps. As I described on the phone,  
Company will pay you for the next two weeks, but we will not expect you to work for the company during that time. We hope that you will use this time to focus on finding and getting help for yourself.  
Company will pay for your health insurance premium through December 2023.  
Company will put you on unpaid leave through January 2.  
Let's meet on Tuesday, January 2 to discuss your progress and improvement plan, and evaluate the possibility of having your return to work at our company. The key will be if you can avoid the interactions that negatively impact our workplace.  
Thank you very much, and I wish you the very best. I look forward to talking with you soon.

I have a boyfriend, but he's also busy all the time and is going through health problems at the moment causing him to not be around as much. We're also long distance.

It seems like your fears combined with your intense desire to fit in and succeed have resulted in frequent email, slack and in person interactions with people at our company that have become counter productive for you and for our company to succeed. I (and several others) have attempted to talk with you and be helpful. Unfortunately, we do not have the skill or ability within our company to properly help you. You mentioned that you spoke with your sister about getting therapy. I also suggested that you ask a doctor about what kind of help may be available. You told me that you've had similar things happen to you in high school and in college. There is no doubt in my mind that you have the drive and determination to make changes, and I hope you can find professional guidance and feedback to show you the way.  
I sincerely hope that you can get the help that you need.  
Next steps. As I described on the phone,  
Company will pay you for the next two weeks, but we will not expect you to work for the company during that time. We hope that you will use this time to focus on finding and getting help for yourself.  
Company will pay for your health insurance premium through December 2023.  
Company will put you on unpaid leave through January 2.  
Let's meet on Tuesday, January 2 to discuss your progress and improvement plan, and evaluate the possibility of having your return to work at our company. The key will be if you can avoid the interactions that negatively impact our workplace.  
Thank you very much, and I wish you the very best. I look forward to talking with you soon.",1700164925.0,

Maybe you can help me-

I have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. It’s an autoimmune disease that can cause a wide variety of issues.

I’ve had it for about 15 years. For many of those years, I had few bothersome symptoms. I was a bit overweight and always tired. That was annoying but about it.

However, after contracting C-19, I developed mental health issues.

I now have been suffering from debilitating health anxiety. My days, experiences and joy are ruined just waiting for the bomb to drop that I’m dying from cancer or some other debilitating disease.

I think C-19 mixed with an inflammatory autoimmune condition messed some things up. I now have occasion headaches I never used to have, tinnitus(ringing in my ears) joint and muscle pain and the worst…the anxiety and depression. I had never experienced ongoing anxiety before. Just random bouts of normal anxiety like going into a job interview.

But now…every single pain, ache, scrape, bump, lump, dizzy spell, headache, twitch….I google myself into the grave.

I know it sounds crazy. But it’s like an obsession now. I get so anxious. I get sick over an imagined diagnosis.

I had blood work for my annual tomorrow and went into a complete spiral over one value being off. Everything else looked great. I googled it and convinced myself I am not long for this world. I’ve been to an ENT, audiologist, have fairly regular blood work (at least once a year if not more), annual check ups…I am at this crazy point of wishing I could ask for tons of scans, MRI, x-ray…and then again, I’m afraid to know!

It is EXHAUSTING. I’m at the end of my rope.

I am doing CBT, trying to practice techniques like journaling or breathing.

It’s helping minimally.

I am not on medication for anxiety.

But I am absolutely exhausted. This past year and a half has been the most joyless, hopeless, miserable and painful time.

I want to enjoy my kids and husband again.

I have days or weeks where I feel great and normal and then my brain goes “but you’re not worrying about your health and that means you’re missing something and you should be on high alert” and then there’s all the good…sucked right out of me.

Has anyone healed from this horrendous affliction? Are meds the answer?

Is there hope for healing and finding joy again?

For the past few months, I feel like I don't observe things at work, or disregard things that I do notice. I feel pretty insecure when I see other people take notice of issues and take action. I just never take the initiative. When I do push myself to be more present, I feel like I'm in a race, I'm hyper activated. Then, I feel like I'm overthinking, so I compensate for it by being lazy about it. Because of this, I feel like I'm stuck in a rut, that I'm not growing and evolving as a professional.

Miserable-Republic29,I almost didn't take my life during my mandatory service in IDF.,1,17vosg1,0,"Everything began when my parents divorced in NY when I moved back to Israel to be with my mum family. My mum took us both after the finalization of the divorce because she needed help from her family.  
  
I had to go to school, and then my true problems began. My older siblings (half-brothers on her side) were all 18+ and had to enlist for their mandatory service. My mum was constantly working. Nobody was home except for my aunt. She got a deferral from the reserve in order to take care of me. My other problems began when I discovered problems with my socialization with the other kids in school. Those problems were because we were culturally different and had different viewpoints. The school principal assigned a teacher who was helping kids with special needs. The teacher consulted my family - I probably had mental health and emotional issues. We didn’t take it seriously.  
  
Not everything was bad. When I was in middle school, I met this cool kid we became best buds. After I finished high school, I had to enlist. I went to the Medical Commission office and proceeded. Everything was alright with my mental and physical health. I’ve been stationed in a base close to my home. Fortunately, my best friend was stationed beside me. Due to our schedule at the base, our time together was limited. I could not take it anymore. One evening. The base commander called me, and I rushed into his office. He asked what I wanted to do with my life. I did not answer, and he sent me back to the dorms. I took a bath and held a razor sharp. The only thing I recall was the darkness.  
  
After this, I woke up in a room in a hospital with signs in English. It has been 7th March. I was in the bath on 28 Friday, Oct. 2021. That means I was in a coma for several months. My aunt, my mum sister, and my dad were in the room beside me. I could not feel my legs. The doctors stated I was transported from my base to NY because my medical insurance covered it.

These past month I started seeing a new therapist and I've been feeling so, so much better and as if I just woken up from a very long sleep. I'm truly starting to feel hope for the future. I know that the journey to healing will be long but I've been wondering about others experience with this: I'm feeling better so failing a class is not such a big deal anymore in the sense that it's not a harrowing thought so even though I have finals I can't seem to be able to sit down and study. it's frustrating because, before, I would study and then give up before the exam because I felt as if I was going to fail anyway, there's not point in trying, etc. I was terrified of failing. And now it's frustrating because even though I feel well I can't seem to manage with this. Am I just a lazy person? Has anyone felt like this? I've been going out and actually enjoying it, I'm taking care of myself, going outside has stopped being so scary and I want to keep enjoying that.

Keepontyping,Here's my next plan.,1,17vhiqy,1,"I don't want to type a super long post.

I've dealt with anxiety / depression for 4 years now. I've had both to a degree, but I had a huge nervous breakdown  4 years ago.

Every 3-6 months I reassess and make a plan. I needed major help in the beginning, counselling, etc. I was in chronic pain. Lots of panic attacks. No meds though

These days things are much much better. I'm doing pretty ok. I've made great progress. Mostly suffer from headaches still / somatic feelings and racing thoughts. Some fogginess at times. 

But today I made a new plan to help me over the next 6 months. Particularly the headaches

1. Hydration - got some electrolyte powder
2. 3 different kinds of magnesium to use and L theanine (Using Huberman as a resource)
3. Going to high dose fish oil with Tumeric  (Again Huberman)
4. Taking Creatine (Huberman) 
5. Continue reducing social media
6. Haven't been to a counselor in 6 months. Found a new psychologist to help me process stress.
7. Continue my daily walks, though now without listening to podcasts that ""rev"" me up. 
8. Morning sun lamp exposure.
9. December i see an ENT doctor. 

I did Keto for 9 months. I've lost 40 some pounds. Which is great. Going to eat more normally again for awhile. I've earned the change. 

I think tonight it's important for me to recognize how far I've come and that I have a plan for my future. While i'm focusing on myself, I'm not going to do it obsessively. It's better just to have the plan, and then let go and focus on others. If I obsess on myself it backfires. 

I've got a plan, there's always hope, and in the meantime, I'm a useful person.

A little bit of history. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in 2021 after trying quite a few meds I found that Effexor and Wellbutrin seem to be the pills that help me. Stay stable. I have been completely stable with no big episodes in over a year. I even got married and didn’t freak out once about my own wedding and the planning process, which shows how far I’ve come with my mental health journey.

 I have a few questions and concerns about pregnancy and antidepressants/mental health that I am hoping to get a little bit more insight on.  

1. I have a phobia of vomit to the point where if I end up feeling sick or getting sick, I have a panic attack and can’t control myself. My friends have told me that their morning sickness has been the worst thing for their pregnancies., and after joining this page all I’ve seen is people being sick for months on end to the point where if I end up feeling sick or getting sick, I have a panic attack and can’t control myself. My friends have told me that their morning sickness has been one of the worst parts of their pregnancies and happened during their entire journey. I don’t want to be sick the entire time I am pregnant that will be the worst thing I can imagine.

2. I had a really bad mental health, so two years ago and after trial and error I have finally found a concoction that is keeping me stable. I’m currently on Wellbutrin antifactor, and I know that I will have to stop by Wellbutrin if I am to carry a child.

I started these to manage my anxiety and depression, and the thought of stopping or adjusting any of it is giving me really bad anxiety but I know it’s something that would need to happen. I just don’t want to take a giant step back after I’ve made all this progress. 

3. I am terrified of having a miscarriage. I don’t think I would be able to handle it mentally, especially if I have to stop taking my meds. Which also leads me to one of my biggest fears, which is having postpartum and not being able to connect with my own kid. 

My husband and I want to start a family more than anything in the world and my preference would be adoption or surrogacy however, in this economy that does not seem to be a feasible way to start the process.

I don’t why I’ve posted here. Maybe releasing my worries out here might help a bit more. So here they are:

Worries that are keeping me awake tonight:

1. WORK

What triggered this:

Work email I sent out to everyone including the manager who told me they won’t accept handover of project due to the system in question being down. 
Asked if we can handover anyway as business happy, sign off received, and pass rate was 97%. Did not run email past internally with Ops Manager before sending when emotions are high.

Worse case scenario:

Complaint against me for escalating from said manager that said no.
Director calls to reprimand me
Relationship damage with said manager. Relationship damage with others included in email.

What can I do about it right now:

Recall email however, no idea if the email has been read by anyone. If successful they may ask what was the email. Nothing else I can do.

What can I do tomorrow:

Apologise for sending email and apologise to manager publicly.
Acted out of frustration against better judgement.
Frustration due to two other projects are not ready due to one had build issues out of my control and the other will not be accepted into support due to element of it being an app they do not know about. This project was the only one that went really well and confidence is high.


2. GOOD DOG NEEDS A GROOM

What triggered this:

Sent groomer a message this morning asking if they can fit good dog in next week apart from Wednesday.
Realised I may have missed a previous appointment.

Worse case scenario:

They do not reply back
Will no longer take good boy

What can I do about it right now:

Nothing. It’s nearly 1am and there would be no appreciation at all if send message right now.

What can I do tomorrow:

Send message again to apologise and realise I had missed previous appointments.

The main reason of the bullying nowadays is because I like Disneyland and going to there, since I live not far. I’m on the autism spectrum and people say untrue stuff about me, even some who work there, and I believe it because it makes me less of a man, which I also believe.

Jimmy244,"I work from home now and love the benefits of it, but being stuck home all day is really getting to me and making me a bit insane, anyone else feel like this?",2,17qukz5,2,"I'm a guy in my mid 20s and had been working at my current job for a bit over a year at first in office, but recently been offered the opportunity to work remotely, and since my job is far from home, I jumped at the chance and things have been great work wise the past several months, plus saving lots of money and time not having to do Lyft and Train or Bus rides both to & from work, not having to get dressed up or anything, etc.

As much as I prefer being home and after work having more free time to just do what I want instead of waiting for Trains and such, I kinda miss the ability to travel on my own on a Train or Bus and being out. I don't miss the office much itself and didn't really speak to anyone there anyway. But right now for example, I haven't left my house in almost a month (not counting trips to get the mail or something). For one, I have a disability which prevents me from being able to drive so anytime I go out it's because my parents are going out and I volunteer to come, or if I HAVE to go out so I ask for a ride if my family isn't busy. To make matters worse, I live in an area where public transportation is very limited and doesn't even run on weekends close to the area I live. You need a car to survive where I live unfortunately. These Buses and Trains require me to be driven to them in the first place. I can't afford at the moment to move now on my own. 

I also don't have any irl friends, girlfriend, etc. I do have good online friends and groups online I talk in but that's it as far as social life so I can't go out with anyone. I'm typically conent with being alone and keeping to myself, hobbies, projects, etc. But every now and then I feel the longing for real life friends and or maybe even a girlfriend so I could hang out with or something, working from home REALLY limits the ability to find these things since I never leave home. All of my interests are the geeky type so that doesn't help much and I'm really shy and introverted and never found it easy to have real friends. Had very few but things end when they move or we lose touch.

 Sometimes I feel like leaving the social medias so I don't have to look at what people in online groups are doing cause they can drive and or live in areas with some places I would like to go to but my area doesn't have in a reasonable distance for my family to drive me to. I also feel envious of my siblings who have friends they see, significant others, can drive and do whatever they want, and every now and then it's been eating at me, Right now feeling like this again for example and it's been aggrivating me, hadn't been sleeping well either.

Old-Satisfaction-538,I’ve identified the (rational) causes of my depression,3,17qhavh,0,"This is my first Reddit post and it’s gonna be quite lengthy.
I’m about to schedule my first appointment with a therapist in the United States since I moved here 8 years ago and this prompted me to create a list of all my issues so that I don’t go there unprepared. 

English is not my native language which makes me a bit anxious about the upcoming appointment. Here are the outcomes of my self-analysis:

I am 34, my parents separated when I was 7 after my dad attempted to beat my mom up to death in front of me. My mom and I moved to another city but our hardships didn't end there.. 
I still had to visit my dad every two weeks. Instead of spending quality time with me, he would just bad-mouth my mom for the whole duration of my visits.
He once showed up late at night at our new home, destroyed my mom’s car with his bare hands and wrote “*my mom’s name* is a wh0re” with his blood on the wall in front of my building. I would have to see that every day before going to school. 
My mom and I had to change 4/5 apartments before finding some stability and financial security. 
We ended up living in the projects. During the initial weeks there we slept on a mattress on the floor. The police would occasionally show up before we finalized the paperwork to stay there, and we lived in constant fear of eviction, so we often pretended we weren't home.

My mom had a couple of new relationships after leaving my dad, and I had to witness her having sex with these new partners, which was emotionally distressing to say the least. When I turned 12, she became pregnant, and this news made me sob. 

At the age of 12, I went on a vacation with my dad's sister, who, along with her partner, struggled with heroin addiction. They would often fall asleep standing up in the middle of the hotel room, and even while driving.

I lived from age 9 till age 20 in a tiny apartment with my mom and an ignorant man (and later on, also with my brother) and I didn’t have my own bedroom. So I couldn’t sleep whenever I wanted to and I didn’t have any privacy. 

I am gay. Don’t get me started on all the stressors involved in the life of a gay teenager who - back then - was in the closet. 

 To this day my both my mom’s family and my dad’s family are toxic. 

My mom is still in a relationship with the father of her second child, a man I’ve always hated, even though she doesn't love him or hold him in high esteem.
My mom has metastatic cancer, currently with no significant symptoms. I don’t know how much time she has left, and I live in another continent, unable to provide her with the care I wish I could.
My depression, social anxiety and habits to procrastinate have already made me waste a lot of time (career wise) and her illness further complicates matters as I want to change jobs, but my current job would allow me to go to Italy and stay with her for an extended period when her condition worsens.

My dad hasn’t been cleaning the house in a decade and when I visit him I have to sit on a couch covered in breadcrumbs. There’s glass on the floor from a broken jar that fell 5 years ago. 
He’s now facing jail time for the way he ended a relationship 10 years ago, and for what he did to my mom 27 years ago (including the fact that he has never paid child support for me).
His sister (the heroin addict) lives in his same apartment building and refuses to acknowledge her son's autism.

As for my romantic life, I’ll try to be brief: when I was 23 I was in a relationship with a 46 year old man who would tell me he was 33. He could get away with it because he looked great for his age. He cheated on me multiple times and then I found out I wasn’t even the official boyfriend: he had someone else who was more important than me. 
In order to forget about him I took a vacation to South Florida where I met my ex husband. 
I was so in love and I thought I had finally found the right one. I even wanted to adopt kids. 
After a one-year long-distance relationship (during which I managed to visit him 4 times) I finally moved to America, after turning down career-changing offers and a lot of money, only to find out that he had cheated on me multiple times, too. We tried to make it work for a while, regardless of the betrayals, we even got married, but we failed. We started living together as friends but then he started doing meth, started borrowing money from me and he became paranoid about non-existent parasites in the house’s furniture so we had a huge fight and we both moved out.

I have been single for 4 years now and I have zero interest in getting to know people. 
I don’t think I would be able to trust another man in the future, I wouldn’t even trust myself. I’m afraid I would get bored and that I would wanna cheat because I invested so much on my ex to no avail.

I’m dissatisfied with my career and I lack motivation to start something more meaningful, despite believing I deserve more. I don’t make a lot of money working at a pizza place, there is no table service so we make few tips. 
I’m not motivated to go back to school because all I wanted in my life was to become a famous singer and at age 34 I think it’s too late for that. 

I have body image issues and a constant feeling of being judged and closely observed.
I have these particular issues because I also judge men and their desirability from their physical appearance. I’m out of shape and I’m sad. At the same time I really have a hard time getting into a fitness routine because I feel extremely lazy and fatigued.

As for my current sex life, I’m afraid to bottom because a few years ago I had to have surgery for an anal fistula (a condition that might occur to anybody. In my case it was caused by forcing myself to poop) but I have a hard time topping, too, because it’s difficult for me to maintain an erection. I have performance anxiety, I start noticing physical flaws on the other person and it kills the mood. 
When I manage to stay hard, I really don’t last long, because I’m super sensitive down there. 

Finally, I should mention a feeling of lingering embarrassment and humiliation that occur after  awkward interactions (with customers at work, with vendors at the gas station, with strangers at the club etc.) in everyday life. 

But what I feel the most is a sense of aimlessly drifting through life.

She is a good hearted person who works with elders in a nursing home. She received her CNA when she was a junior and starts nursing school next fall. This is the issue: Every friend she’s ever had has deserted her so she’s gone through her high school years basically alone. She has a hard time keeping friends because they don’t understand her struggles with panic attacks and depression. This started in 7th Grade. She had a friend named Alex .. I used to be his teacher in the daycare , he was only 1. Madi was the same age and basically grew up together in the daycare . She was Invited to every Birthday party etc. they were inseparable. Fast fwd to 7th Grade. He text her one day and told her he no longer wanted to be with her . (He called her is gf ) At that time her mental health problems started. She sat on my couch and basically had a nervous breakdown. As a mother it was heartbreaking to watch . She’s gained weight, she doesn’t care about the way she looks, and there was a time I honestly thought I’d lose her. Now when she gets home she gets on the couch, covers up with a blanket , sleeps and closes the world out. Her second friend (which by this point is all she had left) left her, her sophomore year and replaced her by girls in show choir . (Another breakdown) I wish I knew how to help her.

AccordingBeyond2985,My hypochondria and fears of death are killing me.,1,17p62zv,1,"**The main points and question will be in bold context and will be** normal**. Questions at the bottom. The reason the flow/train of thoughts or whatever might be inconsistent its cause i spend like 5 days writing this. Any advice about ocd, anxiety and fear is welcome. Help me.**

  
I will be getting therapy but i need help right now. **I have been struggling with ocd and anxiety for about 4 years now and ive had enough.** I will try to explain as much as I can as short as I can. **I fear death like most of us but the overbearing fear of death and fear of my own health and the way i respond to it has been inadvertently killing me physically and mentally.** The fears and worries peaked in 2021 and they arent as bad now but ive realized the up and down cycle of fear and put it off until now. **These past 2 weeks Ive been washing my hands a lot and this resulted in getting cuts and breaks in my hands from over washing them starting last week and its not getting better, in fact this is probably the worst it has ever been or second worst**(I started trying to write this about 4 days ago and it started annoying and now its really bad)**.** Now ever since i got the cuts i cant exactly wrap my entire hand so i keep it open but i put ointments and such to help it heal, but im constantly worried about infections and possibly die or lose my hand because i fear i have touched something ive considered dirty. And when im washing my hands i have a weird number system that i think might be a common symptom of ocd. What is it is when i am first wetting my hands i switch which hand i put in the water 1 at a time cause im afraid ill touch my sink which is a little small and i consider it dirty and if i think i touched the sink i have to rinse that hand in the water again until im 100% sure that they are properly wet. **The thing is like 99% of the time when i think i touched the sink i never did and since i think the sink is dirty i worry about getting an infection like all the time now. And also I cant put my hands each in either 3 times each or 6 times each cause devil number.** Even though i barely believe in god. Then I lather with soap same thing cant touch anything dirty and cant lather for 6 seconds or 12. Then I have to rinse and cant do 3 times or 6. Lots of room to fail or think i failed at these stupid rules. Then when my hands are clean and i go to turn off the light in the bathroom i think i somehow think i touched the toilet seat even though im tall and keep my hands at chest length and it nags me until i give up and just go back to wash my hands. **Its the same with other things like another example.** I was making tacos 2 days ago and i consider the stove top dirty(which this time it actually is) and when i am trying to put the tortillas on the pan i fear they may have touched it somehow and throw away those tortillas and get new ones and the cycle repeats until i am 100% sure or I force myself to do it. **Basically my brain tries to trick me into thinking ive touched something dirty when i know i didnt but the feeling persists until i give up and try whatever i was doing again fresh. Then it was just always dirty in the first place to my brain reinforcing the belief and snowballing. And I keep washing and washing and washing and its literal hell. This has put me off from doing anything that requires me to wash my hands after like cooking or cleaning. And i especially cant do it now cause of the open wounds.** **Ive been trying to fight it but that nagging feeling can be too much most of the time its gotten to the point where ive had 2 mental breakdowns and im losing my shit. At this point as im writing this ive pretty much surrendered. And when i do fight back the feeling never goes away. Im just so fucking tired at this point. Logic only helps a little but it would mostly depend on physical feeling to know i never touched anything but im tricking the air and water on my hands for physically touching something i consider dirty or my mind is just making it up. The best way i can describe this feeling is like all the what ifs about dying and my health in one annoying feeling. The second problem is part of the first which is thinking that washing my hands once isnt enough.** **I know that sometimes it isnt enough but most of the time it is.** For example after i take a number dos i dont wash my hands once. I wash my hands then wash my forearm then wash my hands again. 1 to ensure my hands are cleaner than before for my forearm and then washing my hands again last to get rid of the germs that may have gotten on my hands from my forearms. I wash my forearms because i know that my wrist touch my ass. I know no one else does this and i wonder why, either they are just naive or there is no point. I dont believe that if i wash my hands once that they are clean and i need help with that. **Explaining the science of soap and handwashing would be great for me. Third problem is the intrusive thoughts. With the tag team of the nagging feeling of what if my wounds or hands touched something dirty and these intrusive thoughts they are amazing at making my life hell. After i get past the nagging feeling of what if i touched something dirty the intrusive thoughts then jump in telling me im gonna get an infection and die or something bad is gonna happen. This happens with other shit too not just this instance of the wounds on my hands.** For example a week ago i found about the west nile virus because i saw a video of a dude who was in a wheelchair because he sat on a bench and couldnt stand up ever again because of west nile. The what i assume is the mosquito came out of nowhere and ruined his life and he had no clue and it gets added onto the giant ass list of things i gotta worry about. Or Sepsis how it shows barely any signs and how 1 minute your fine and the next your in the er on the verge of death. Those are just 2 examples and i have probably at least 80 more on the how the fuck are we still alive list, just a few are sepsis, parasites, Naegleria fowleri, cancer, kidney stones, diabetes, war, random attacks/crime on others, serial killers, drunk drivers, just hitting your head on the pavement a little too hard and i have much more that will pop up to ruin my day sooner or later. **Its terrifying knowing how much can ruin your life or end it. The intrusive thoughts have definitely been here the longest and logic helps more with making it go away sometimes. Pretty much everyday im fearing death cause of some bullshit i know is probably not true or not going to kill me but the fear still persists and its hard to ignore. And sometimes it gets so bad the fear paralyzes me to a point where i cant do what i need to do and i regress into searching for short moments of escape from the dread like games or videos ect. Fourth problem is that when i clean something like my phone or a table i use all purpose cleaner for way too long and was wondering the science behind them so i dont have to use so much.** Mine is a lysol all purpose cleaner and is says 10 sec sanitization. Like does it matter how much i wipe or if say i sprayed the spray on a microfiber cloth would that make it less effective shit like that. My mind at this point is a cage of fear that is closing in on me. Please help me.

deepbiz,In few hours my brother will move abroad and I'm terrified of loneliness,1,17p4r0y,0,"It's just a very bad period of my life, probably the worst one. Depression is back in full power, and overall feeling very unwell, physically and mentally.
I don't have good friends and my family is my only support. My parents are getting older and now my brother is moving abroad again.

I always had the phobia of them dying or abandoning me.

Once, a person told me that while they were depressed, their world got little and little. I feel this way. I wake up every day already tired, I don't want to face the world outside. Every day is the same shit.

Now my terror of remaining alone and in pain is intensifying. I wish my brother the best, he has to go to find a better life, but I will miss having him nearby, being able to count on him in case of crisis. Staying with him an afternoon or over dinner was comforting and the thought of this was always uplifting me, allowing me to keep going.

I will move to live on my own soon, as I did in the past. And I'm terrified that I will fail, that I won't be able to face loneliness and stay all the time with myself and my thoughts only.

I often tend to isolate from everyone and everything. I don't go out much, events and parties are a no no lately. Anxiety, fatigue and derealization make socializing extremely difficult. But at the same time I feel so lonely. And I'm terrified of loneliness and the fact that taking care of myself would become too much.

I'm playing scenarios in my head, of when I used to have dinner alone while crying, or too tired to buy groceries, to face problems with the house and neighbours.

Hopefully I will be able to start living again, to have a job and take care of myself. And stop hating and destroying myself. I really hope so.",1699283080.0,
,Cut off half of my family,2,17oqesw,0,"I recently made the choice to cut off half of my biological family from Social Media, Phone Calls and any type of messaging service

&#x200B;

A little about me: 30 Years Old, Assistant General Manager for a Airport Transportation Company. Make well over 100K a year

&#x200B;

They have always treated me like the black sheep of the family because I moved 1 1/2 Hour away when I was young to move in with my new step father at the time (Now My Dad)

&#x200B;

A bit of a background regarding this family: They treat my cousin who is a few months young then me like he is the *KING OF THE HOLY WORLD* and that the Pope doesn't amount to him.

&#x200B;

Back in 2018 I got married to my now ex wife  (another Story for another time) and we invited my Aunts, Uncles, Biological Dad, his spouse, Cousins and Grandparents.

The only people to show were my biological dad cause my Mom told him his !@# better be there and my grandparents. Everyone else made up the most lame excuse on why them couldn't come. One went as far to reply the Hamster died! (Sorry Fluffy)

My aunt who is unable to walk due to spinal injuries and is wheel chair bound, that we made sure there was special accommodations at the hotel and banquet hall for (Oh and by the way is my Godmother) basically said she didn't want to go. but was able to attend a Local Hockey Game that same day.

Now fast forward to recent the cousin who is god in their eyes is now in a stable relationship (good for him) is now having a child with his GF. everyone is making a huge deal of the fact that he's having a kid. Basically treating the expected little one as the Next Jesus. Me and my ex tried to get pregnant several times, unfortunately it just wasn't working. Not one person in the family gave a rats @#\^ that we miscarried.

&#x200B;

Me and my wife split in 2020 due to some issues that is a story for another time. To say I was heart broken was an understatement. My Mom let my biological father know he they split. he called passed on his apologies and made sure i was ok. Keep checking on me for a few weeks. (Only Time I ever felt like he cared) But not one other person in the family passed on apologies or even reached out. My one uncle basically told my brother I deserved it. Not sure how.

&#x200B;

Recently, I made a post on Facebook how children were running around the dining area at IKEA screaming and hollaring and how it was kind of annoying to see the parents literally shrug it off, Even tho the Manager came over and requested they quiet them down as it was literally ear piercing screams. and the godly cousin basically told me that i shouldn't attend restaurants and to stay home from now on! Normally I usually would fire back to him to cram his cake hole. But I realized I have stayed home for 5 Years and that is part of the depression. That I'm extremely Lonely

&#x200B;

I feel like all my anxiety and depression come from how they treated me from when I was younger. At christmas/Thanksgiving. the kids were banished to an unfurnished basement with out even a TV. Literally cement floors and an open pit for the Sump pump. Walls that were never finished so the wood beams were just exposed. Pretty sure we got tetanus from the nails. and 1 window. If we even attempted to go upstairs. we were yelled at. Like sorry we don't want to be in a cold ass dungy basement. I was always told I'd never amount to nothing.

&#x200B;

Recently I was diagnosed with a Really bad Liver Disease that is also affecting my Spleen and Galbladder. Not one of them has taken the time to see how I'm doing. I have to make weekly hospital visits for procedures. 

There is more but  I feel like I've written enough for now and can elaborate further if need be

**Am I wrong in doing this?** I know that once they realize that they can't contact me. Ill get the dreaded phone call from my grandmother. (I still talk to her as she and my grandfather are not like the rest of the family. They are humble and kind), But I've already got my rebuttle for my grandmother. Basically in the sweetest way tell her they don't love or appreciate me grandma. I know she won't buy that and will come back with *oh they love you Blah blah blah*. I just can't be bothered to show them I'm a better person

 Almost 30.  Been sober from alc since 24.  Sobriety is totally not the point.  Or maybe it is idk theres voices in my head.  I vape herb and take perscrptions.  Im self diagnosed autism few months ago, perception and biases now consume me.  They consume you too.  They always have.

Fuck the ego low key.  always sabotaging.  Its our parents fault right? wrong.  Someone out there has it worse.  The one truth life is making me realize admits this confusion is that life is about making the most in spite of circumstance.   Almost 30 years ive played the victim card and i was gonna do it again when i realized the reasion ive been struggling my entire life is austim.

I Mean how could I not.   How many therapists have I scene?  How many perceptions?  How has everyone failed me.  Forget that we cant do that anymore.  Recovery taught me a very important lesson.

We can only control how we react to that we cannot cantrol.  some shit like that

The Food.   The PLastic Water.  The convience Stores.  The Food is poison there is no healthy food.  The food causes these symptoms.  my years of struggling in school.   The confusion.

The Pills they give you.  I ask you who do you know started on a med and got better?  I dont know but my personal expierince which is not factual suggests the pills are doing harm.

Im an addict I love my stimilant adhd meds it truely level the playing field

Untill I realize I havent enjoyed video games in years.  That I dont care im losing contact with friends that care about me.  That I know what I need to do but am simply just not ready.  but now i am its these pills.  but thats just a small layer

theres so may gay and trans people.  thats great but why.  Women have been opperessed for years so it makes sense many of them want to appear as mascline.  and idk sometimes when i eat a lot of sugar i feel fruity low key but im dead fucking serious when i say i think the food is making us gay.  theres nothing wrong with this but from a legit health point of view it seems like high powers are trying to make people more confused and weak.  im at  a healthy weight my diet is shit but lately they tell me im looking skinny but its because the food is making me confused.  not in a gay way but in a mentally fucking cofnused and depressed way.

Recently more people I know adults who are getting older are getting anxious.  Maybe it post covid maybe its stimuli overload fromstupiud fuckiong phones we cant use the bathroom without.

IM losing my shit Khols is charging like 300 dollars for shit, i never should have signed up.  Got played cant blame anyone but myself.  gonna pay it have the money.   It was wild cuz i felt a surge of anger but i couldnt find where to put it.  what was i gonna do drive to khols and yell at employess?  Of course not, they arnt they genius who wrote the khols contract.  These invisbile people i want to let my anger out on but all you get is an endless abyss of outsourced calls and wait times.  you never see these faces.  Im going to pay the 300 maybe right after i post this maybe.  i have the money.  The money is not the issue at least the main issue.  What got me is that those contracts and any subscriptions do that and of course its undisputable. and deliberate and this is nothing new.  Im pushing 30 but am still naive AF.   theres so much risidual anger.  everything is bad.  I work for jeff bezos im physically a beast but by brain is rotting im a creative person and im just killing my body mind slowly but it feels like every hwere i look invible men are toying with me like its been rigged from the start.   which it kinda is.  but i gootta keep moving foward you have to.

No2BroadsideFan,Counseling Tomorrow.,2,17nfrsc,1,"11/04/2023 12:44 am

I am 18M, and I've struggled with anxiety for maybe 10 years now. Not until the pandemic was there any attempt to help me with my struggles, during which my social and general anxiety worsened, as did signs of ADHD and possibly depression, though that last one is only a hunch on my part. 

Tomorrow I have another counseling session scheduled, and around this time I get terrified. Every Friday before a session something will pop up. It can sound really small and inconsequential, but I get torn up inside. Today, it was in automotive class. I was left alone from a group of three, and I worked on a car by myself. I am not an expert, and I didn't grow up working with cars so I'm was very apprehensive about even touching a car. I've come a long way, but I'm afraid of mistakes. 

For as long as I've remembered, I could never handle mistakes. I lock up at the thought of messing up, and resist asking for help. I struggled throughout all of elementary, middle, and high school because I never asked for help, and I never asked for tutoring. I had already made a mistake a few weeks ago, and I thought that would help free me. I guess not. I stood there for an hour, checking online specifications for what to do and not being able to do it. At the same time, I knew if I just brought a hammer and hit the drum I could start working. I waited, like I always do, for the best time to ask for help from my teacher. That time never comes. 

After another student came to my rescue, I tried to do what I could, measuring and inspecting diameters and such. When the time came for cleaning up I for the life of me could not roll back a stupid wheel on the stupid brake design and asked the teacher for help. He shows me how to fix it, I try to fix it on the other side, my team members frustrate me with their lack of communication before my teacher comes back to show me it's completed. At this point I was feeling better about myself, but still needed to put the wheels back on. I put them on, just to forget one step. 

I forgot to put the center cap on. Now we, my team who finished work on the instructors vehicle, have to undo the lug nuts, put the cover on first, then tighten and torque them down. I stood there like an idiot when he, Member 1, told me to raise the vehicle back up. When Member 2 came back I could hear him say, ""Why do I have to do all the work?"" under his breath. I hated myself, because he was right. I took too long, didn't get everything I needed done, and they had to help speed things up. I wanted to tell him he could leave, both of them, but I needed M1 to drive the car away. I'm not the fastest, but I wish I had my license so no one else needed to wait on me. It's the worst feeling, being relied on and not being there to help. Being late, I hate it because I would wait 30 minutes for my family to pick me up thinking they died in a car accident. Because I was a dramatic 8 year old, and my house was only 8 minutes to walk to, and because I feel like a burden. I don't want to be a burden. 

The car was driven away, I put my things up and waited outside the room, trying to listen to what they had to say, like I would hear them talking behind my back. I left the shop, and yet still waited because my ride was running late, again. M1 said goodbye, despite my efforts to hide away. 

The car ride home I thought about what happened, and I wanted to kill myself. I think about suicide almost every day, in passing moments. On my worse days I think about grabbing something sharp, and I almost want to go downstairs and open the drawer. There was some of that today. I don't know how else to end this or what I can write, just that I've yet to tell my parents the full extent. Part of me wants to be locked up, but life moves on. Another part of me wants to sleep, which is what I'll do. ",1699079997.0,

I've been staying in your house for two days now, and I've told you several times how much I enjoy being here. However, being here doesn't feel the same without you. If you recall our conversation in the car, you asked if I felt happy because of the small wins we've had this year, like suddenly finding work and being able to go around places. I can't say I'm unhappy, but I'm not exactly happy either. Nonetheless, when I'm with you, I feel more than okay – I feel like I have no worries at all.
    
I'm alone and feeling lonely right now, and everything seems different in your absence. I hesitate to admit it, as I don't want to seem dependent on you. It's more about being alone in your house with extra time and space to think. November is here, and it's a month I despise for reasons you're well aware of. I've been shedding tears for days, not knowing why the hell am I feeling that way. Sleep scares me as I fear the nightmares that may haunt me, leaving me screaming or crying for help, something I would loathe myself for.
    
I miss you so bad. I want you here, always. I may come across as selfish for saying this, but I long for your presence, or even being around you. Knowing that you're in the house, either at work or at play, is what I need right now. While I understand you're having a good time, I truly appreciate your updates about what's happening there.

If I do, my father will get loans in his name and I’ll have to pay him back later. But in total, I’ll have about 80,000 dollars in student debt.

Dizziness and lightheaded was followed till the 28th of December when I nearly fainted again and had really high heart rate: went to hospital. They did blood work and ecg couldn’t find a probable cause. Went to hospital again 3 days later and no findings were evident. Upon my 3rd visit to hospital X-ray was done off my chest and nothing was found. I was bedridden for 6 weeks, everyday was a battle for life, I felt like I was in septic shock everyday. I had to get iv fluids about 10 times because of dehydration, I sweated constantly with no appetite for water or food.

Let’s go back to my childhood, my earliest memory is probably when I was around 10. If I would focus on my breathing it felt like I couldn’t breath anymore. I also had these unexplained spinning and dizziness at a young age during sleep time. Doctors couldn’t find anything. I was always a scared kid thinking about the worse case scenario that might kill me but in reality it was overthinking. In highschool a few times I nearly fainted out of the blue. Sometimes during sports I’ll hit a point where out of no where my heart would start racing and my breathing would become laboured. Sometimes over excitement caused this as well.

Now medications 

Lexapro 40mg for 6 months, no benefits. Made me really bad during the first 2 weeks and kinda of settled after that, dumbed the depressive symptoms but that’s about it. Felt much better after coming off, it definitely made my condition worse. Derealisation, fatigue, tiredness, forgetfulness. All of it.

Zoloft 50mg for 18 days and 100mg for 3 days, had a panic attack on day 3 I thought it was Zoloft but found it to be thc later on. Discontinued Zoloft then. No benefits during the 18 days on 50mg and made my condition way worse.

Paxil 20mg for 2 months, probably one of the strongest reactions to any ssri, daily panic attacks losing my mind, as if there’s a laughter in my head but it’s my internal monologue creating it but still I was losing it. Pushed on for 2 months and it just made me worse as the days went on.

Agomelatine 20mg no benefits, daily panic attacks, took it for about 36 days.

Pristiq, I’m on day 54 and I’ve stopped taking it, my last dose was on Wednesday not sure how to stop. It’s making me worse, mood is swinging, brain fog and all other symptoms are reappearing on this medication.

Clonidine didn’t do much except relax my body alittle

Lyrica, knocked me out at 25mg and made me tired. No benefits.

Valium 5mg, very small relief, short benefits 3-5 hours, more of a muscle relaxant, addictive in nature.

Clonezapam 1mg, small amount of relief, short relief 3-5 hours. 

Xanax 2mg, haven’t tried 

Ativan 1mg only have tried 0.5mg and it didn’t do much.

Seroquel 25mg, good for sleep, couldn’t sleep for more then 4 hours for the last 5 years or so, now I get a solid 8 hours, it’s not a 100% good quality sleep but it gets the job done, I don’t feel tired through the day as before I got sick.

Epilim haven’t tried chickenend out

Lamictal discontinued on day 3 after developing rash

Lithium 500mg, 37 days. Left like losing my mind not sure if adverse reaction to the lithium or it was some kind of discontinuation I was getting from the lexapro. 

Prozac 4 days to bridge off lexapro

She told me I might have another underlying mental condition that is causing the anxiety, she floated the idea of bipolar, thought she wasn’t too sure and said I’m an unusual case. 

Thc/cbd oil, made me go full panic mode for 4 hours each time I tried it. Very similar to what I was feeling with the Paxil minus the laughter side effect.

Currently my biggest challenges are

I think I’m developing schizophrenia all the time, and I’m going to lose my mind.

I’m hyper vigilant and see things in the corners of my eye.

My physical symptoms cycle throughout the weeks and I’m never symptomsless. Physical or cognitive I always feel something.

My mind always feels like as if something is off,

As my overall condition gets worse my brain fogs becomes really bad and my hands and feet become so cold to the touch, 

I become very forgetful

I can never stop thinking about my condition, my mind is occupied by it 24/7

When I go into crowded areas my physical symptoms become much worse, such as brain fog heart rate and jelly legs.

My internal monologue never shuts up and it’s always active.

Racing thoughts

When I’m on medications l as ssri’s I get irrational fears such as being allergic to nuts or something crazy. But seems to go away after a month when discontinuing  the medication,

Lightheaded, feel like my neck muscles are so tense that my brain isn’t getting enough blood.

I’m hyper focused on all bodily functions physical or Cognitive, if I suspect something that is schizophrenic or damaging I get a mini panic attack. But panic attack do occur for no reason as well most of the times.

I’m in this state constantly let’s say chronically,",1698851133.0,
