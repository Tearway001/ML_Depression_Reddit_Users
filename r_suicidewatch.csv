SQLwitch,"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement",1781,cz6nfd,248,"We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",1567525791.0,moderator
SQLwitch,Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,716,pl9suy,43,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",1631232110.0,moderator
eiura,I am so unattractive that I want to kill myself,102,1c6aj1f,24,"I am a severely unattractive person. It hurts me so much to live with this face. Seeing myself in the mirror or photos kills my self-confidence. I do not only have to deal with the dread of seeing my own horrifying reflection, but also the treatment that I receive from others. I have had people move places when I sat next to them. When I talk to people they have this look in their eyes that signals disgust. I have been made fun in front of my face on several occasions. I have been told I am ugly both online and in real life. 

It’s not an issue of weight. I have a healthy and normal body weight. I dress well. I keep my hygiene. The issue is my face. I have facial features and a facial structure that can not be improved through plastic surgery. 

I get so jealous of women my age. I keep constantly seeing beautiful women all around me. They have everything I don’t. I feel like an ogre next to them. 

I hate writing this as it makes me feel weak. I want to be able to deal with my emotions without having to spew them out to strangers online. But I feel that I can’t take this anymore.

Holiday-Yam-7810,I sexually assaulted my cousin and I deserve to die.,7,1c6fl5h,3,"Hello! M23 its been 7 years since I last saw my cousins and my uncle (My dads brother) and his wife. The reason is I sexually assaulted my little cousin 7 years ago. the story is and ill try to compress it. My uncles maid was the one who told on me, and the next day my father woke me up dragging me outside of my room and beating me up. I was confused at the time to why was he doing this to me then he shouted at me “What did you do to your cousin” so fast forward a year later my uncle and his family moved out of the house (since we all lived in my families ancestral home) My uncle wanted to have me arrested at first but they just asked to bring me to therapy but damn it really didn’t fucking help I use to think my therapist wasn’t the right fit for me but I realized in the I didn’t need therapy I knew what I did, I tried to bury it in my mind to act innocent but late at night when the voices start getting louder, you just can’t help but to break down and doubt your whole life. For the past 7 years I’ve tried to live a normal life like nothing happened maybe this is the reason why my dad says im not remorseful with what I did but fuck. There is no day that I never regretted what I’ve done. Ive tried killing myself thinking my family will be fixed if I was out of the picture but Im too much of a coward to do it. I resorted to hurting myself and doing drugs just so someone would ask me if I was alright. I wanted someone to listen to me and not crucify me because I know what I did was wrong I fucking know you don’t need to remind me. I’ve been thinking how to apologize to my uncle and his family but I dont know what to say and I think its too late. My heart hurts whenever I remember that day. I would give up anything just to fix this. Last month I was riding the train and I saw my other cousin (The older brother) I saw him and he was all grown up. I wanted to go to him and hug him but I stopped. I cried quietly the whole train ride. I’ve always think about killing myself and as time goes by my courage to do it is almost there. To people that dont know what I did they would describe me as happy go lucky, talkative, loud, funny and the most one that I hate they tell me im a good person. Im not I dont deserve this life that I was given. I’m not who I show I am. Its all a mask to cover up how fucking terrible I am and how sad my life is. I know I deserve to die. All I want is to see my cousins and bring back everything to what it was before. I hate seeing my parents having to defend me when Im really the bad person here. I miss my whole family. I should leave. How can I live with a mistake I cant undo?",1713374423.0,

Complete-Opposite217,I irredeemably fucked up and I feel like I have to kill myself because of it,205,1c5sqm7,67,"I am 20M. When I was 17 or 18? I found a video on reddit of a girl undressing, I liked the video so I bookmarked it and returned to watch it every now and then. I didn't open the comments on the video initially but one day I did, and I saw a comment that read something along the lines of ""isn't she 15?"". Reading that comment made me feel distressed and worried, but I continued to return to watch and get off to that video up until I was 19, even with that comment present in my mind.

I know FOR CERTAIN that if it was blatantly obvious or made explicitly clear that the girl in the video was underage, I definitely would have stopped watching it, but I kept watching the video after reading that one comment, and I struggle with an enormous amount of uncertainty and guilt when it comes to me trying to remember what I thought about it. A lot of times, I can't stop feeling convinced that I committed an act that would be seen as an irredeemable evil - I feel like if that comment bothered me that much, I should have stopped watching it, and the only reason I didn't was because I was secretly okay with or into the idea of getting off to a 15 year old. Other times, I try to tell myself that fearing and worrying over one comment I read doesn't mean I thought it was true, and there's no way I could consider my thoughts to be a legitimate desire or belief that the girl was 15 - I felt bad and uneasy about it, after all. I just feel so incredibly terrible that I would choose to keep getting off to that video even after seeing that comment and feeling distressed by it - even if I didn't *want* her to be underage, I still chose to keep watching the video with doubt in my mind.

The really, really fucking horrible thing is that last April (I had stopped watching porn entirely before this point), when this event really started hitting me, I tried to find the video on Reddit again, hoping that maybe I could find some sort of proof in the comment section or on the account that posted it that the girl was of age and it was all okay. Instead, I found the same video on another subreddit with more than one comment either questioning or proclaiming that the girl was indeed underage. I also saw another person who posted the link to the video's supposed ""source"" on Pornhub, and I clicked on it, hoping that the account which posted it could be that of the girl, and there'd be some sort of verification associated with the account of an age 18+ or something - I instead discovered that the video had been taken down for ""violating Pornhub's terms of service"". All of this has me pretty convinced that the girl was indeed underage, meaning I had been getting off to a video of an underage girl even after reading and constantly worrying about a comment saying she was underage.

I have been struggling with obsession and rumination relating to various things i've done in past for the longest time now, but this event has certainly been the one I've obsessed over the most. Over the last year, I have lost so much of what made me myself. The people that used to make me happy are now people I will fear, because I convince myself they would hate me if they knew what I have done. I sleep for hours and hours and don't wake up until I can't sleep anymore because I dread being awake. I have tried different medications and lots of therapy, but I am still struggling horribly. I cannot tell myself I am redeemable, that I deserve to live life the way everyone else does when I have done these things in my past. I live as a husk of my former self, unable to feel genuine happiness or connection with anyone or anything else. I do not want to kill myself, but the urge I feel to end it all is becoming unbearable. I can't see myself living like this for much longer.",1713304940.0,

belitville,My loneliness has consumed me. ,5,1c6fpfh,4,"I’m 25, F, UK based. I grew up in a rather 
unconventional household which I guess set me up for failure from the start. I moved school a lot and always struggled to make friends. I’ve never really had any. I was bullied constantly, slipped into depression at 12 when I first tried to kill myself. This has stayed with me my entire life. Despite being told it would get better. It’s 13 years on and it never did. I built this hard dislikable shell around me. I started uni at 16 and did pretty well academically in my undergrad and subsequent postgrads. I still struggled to make friends or talk to people. Possibly because i was younger than everyone. I spent these years isolated, drinking and taking drugs alone. I was never fond of alcohol but it was the only thing that helped me through my loneliness. Of the few friends I had, I cut them off after uni. I was and still am toxic and aggressive. I’d spend hours a day talking to myself, I still do this. On the outside though, life was easy. I came from a wealthy family, I’m attractive, connected and educated.   
I’ve always known what I wanted from life, it’s the same as everyone - to meet a man I love and adore to give me lots of children. I learned quickly that I’m not the type of person people want to be in a relationship with. I think people like the idea of me but the reality is different. I’m quite rude, self-entitled, I have alcohol/ drug problems, and I’m unemployed. I’ve never had much motivation to get a job and have never been told I had to.  I tried a few times but even the thought of being interviewed filled me with this gut wrenching fear. Of the few I did go to I didn’t get the job, this just reinforced the fact that I’m not good enough so I stopped trying. 
In the years after uni I did try to better myself. I quit the drugs, drink and smoking. I found a sport I love and dedicated myself to it. For the first time in my life I was passionate about something, it made me happy, I was good at it too. On the baseline everything was still the same though. No matter how hard I tried to better myself, people still didn’t like me. After an injury I slipped back into my old ways. 13 years on from my first attempt and I’m exactly the same, things never got better. I was promised they would but they didn’t.

I've attempted suicide multiple times, and I've learned from my mistakes and know what will work now. I've tried all the coping skills and grounding techniques, I'm in therapy, I've been to mental hospitals, I've been on countless different medications. Nothing works.

We were ""together"" for about 3 months and technically he was my first kiss and my first time but I didn't want to count it as that. He had major anger issues and is part of the reason I have major anger issues now as well, I am in therapy for it but constantly think about hurting him, sometimes even killing him. He ended raping me multiple times and for months after it happened I said I was fine even though I wasn't. I told myself and everyone that I didn't blame myself but one day while I was having a panic attack I was crying my eyes out and said ""If only I hadn't fucking trusted him!"" My friend who was comforting me looked at me confused and kept asking what was wrong, I freaked out when I realized that I blamed myself and cried more. That same friend (who we will call Sara) is the one who told the school counselor about him pushing me to the ground and she called my mom which led to my mom calling the police. At the time I blamed my friend for reporting Luke and I wish I hadn't told her I even said to her ""I hope you die"" But a few months ago my other friend told me how she was in a similar situation with a guy and I realized that she loved him as much as I loved Luke and wasn't going to let go of him. I realized in that moment how Sara had felt and how I was wrong to blame her. Sadly I never got to apologize to Sara as she died in a shooting the next year. I forever hold the guilt of blaming her and cry so much because the day she died in the shooting we were supposed to be together and I refused to go because I hated her and she died alone. I hate myself and constantly think about hurting myself or doing something worse for blaming her now that I have been in her position and just hope she rests peacefully now.",1713374718.0,

chandanritvik,A logical argument for NOT committing suicide when death makes more sense than living,6,1c6c49s,11,"One of my best friend recently committed suicide & I couldn't help but contemplate these things.  
A normal person easily accepts the fact without thought that suicide is a foolish decision. ""What kind of fool will end this (sometimes) wonderful life?""  
But for some people life sucks so much that quitting is a logical decision.  
WHO states there is 1 sucide every 40 seconds. 700,000 people dying every year. This is just scratching the surface. Because 20x (14 million) times people, have been contemplating suicide but couldn't act/die as planned.  
X represents things a person likes in life. Y represents those he doesn't like in life. When Y >> X, suicide is a logical option for them. Of course they have strived to change, but unfortunately they couldn't bring down Y.  
But, recently something struck. What if, you change your mind into living solely for others' sake? Hear me out, this is powerful  
There is not much you can do when you can't change YOUR life. But, just consider that your life has already ended. Spend each hour & day for the benifit of other people you love. This maynot be any single person at all. Just have a bunch of people in your mind (friends & family), whom you would like to serve. Perform every action in life assuming that they are the people who are going to benifit from the act. Also make real endeavours to uplift & beautify their lives.  
Living purely for others' sake is beautiful & also logical. Why? Putting hard efforts for one day may not decrease 'Y' \[your problems\] as much as you would like. But you can easily act in a positive additive way for others. It also gives a much higher satisfaction & purpose for living.

Unfortunately for me, everywhere I've been won't sell it and I quickly leave in case they report me to the authorities.

This has led me to resort to my backup plan which involves a strap, plastic bottle caps and rolled up towels - I have already tested this and it does work but getting the placement right is extremely challenging and almost makes me want to stop.

I would have completed this 2 days ago, however I met someone at the start of this trip and things had been going well but they've made a hard decision for their family which I understand, but am also heartbroken over. They know how I feel about them and we've spoken in depth about this but this just compounds my original feelings and cemented my plans.

I wasn’t even there for five seconds before a man tried to hit on me at the shelter. I have one cat and she’s the only family I have left she’s everything to me and I love her to death. Any of the options other than living here would take my cat from me she is an emotional support animal and I would be unhappy in life without her. My dad isn’t reliable and I don’t talk to my mother. I do chores I go to work I keep clean but she is still trying to get rid of me and last night my cat had babies right after I came back to my friends house from meeting with a creepy man to be a potential roommate just so I don’t have to sleep on the street.

I can't talk to my fiance about this anymore because I'm always too negative and it upsets her. My friends don't want to do anything with me. I barely talk to my family. 

 I am so alone, trapped in my own head, spiralling. I want to wake her up and tell her what's going on. I should have her drive me to the crisis center near here. But then what? Even if they can somehow ""fix"" me, it will *never* last. My depression never leaves. It's always here, always telling me I'm worthless. Telling me I'm better off dead. Telling me to just fucking do it already. If I had a gun, I'd take a fucking Uber or Lyft and go somewhere no one will find me and blow my fucking brains out. 

 I can't keep going on like this. I'm only hurting the people I am supposed to love. I don't even know if I feel love. I've always doubted, always thought I'm deluding myself into thinking I have the same feelings as everyone else. But I don't think I do. I am an empty, hollow shell of a person and all I do is ruin things.

 I have to admit something. The main thing stopping me from doing it right here, right now, with the knife in my lap, is my cat. He would never understand, it would hurt him more than I could ever fathom. His mother, the one who raised him, who cuddles with him every night, holding him in her arms, would be abandoning him in his eyes. One day I'm there, the next I'm not. He would never understand. 

 Every day I get closer and closer to committing. To finally pulling the metaphorical trigger. I wish I could just stop existing. I wish I could press a button and just be erased completely from existence, as if I never was born. I hate myself. I hate myself. I fucking hate myself. I deserve this, I'm a selfish, evil monster and I fucking hate myself.

 I'm so fucking alone. Every single fucking time I think I am getting better, this fucking happens. Why? Why does life feel like torture? I don't even want to be happy, I just want to be fucking okay for once in my worthless fucking life. Fuck. I don't even know why I'm typing this. Nothing anyone can say will help me, all I'm doing right now is forcing my pain onto those reading. I'm a fucking awful person. Why am I like this?

my final exam is on the 24.04.24 (next week), i have my final test project going, not doing anything on it, and a final presentation im also not ready for.  


my parents are trying to help but in the worst way possible, screaming, and the usual.  
i recently got cheated on, wont go into details, too many details to that story  
\^ gave me professionally confirmed ptsd, heavy trust issues  
im getting addicted to weed, its my only ""pleasure"" which helps me forget about my current situation atm. kinda helps me alot but its addicting already.  
my depression is winning more and more each day  


  
im loosing friends (especially online, you might think this isnt that bad but ive just recently lost a friend ive known for 8 years due to me being pushy about getting a face reveal. (im sorry if youre reading this?)  
\^ this made me get a heavy fucking fear of loosing more people, ive become overly careful with what i say and always add a ""you dont need to if you dont want to"" / ""you can also just say no"" to everything i ask for.  


  
work is going awful, my contract is not getting extended after my apprenticeship, so to add the cherry ontop of all the studying i need to do, i need to apply for jobs...  
Im also always late atm, i used to arrive at 8AM each day, now i arrive at like 8:50-9:30, my boss already sent me messages because of this.  
i cannot sleep, no matter how hard i try;  


  
i dont want medication, neither a therapist or psychologist. I have had ""help"" from a psychologist before but she only listened and  just prescribted Zoloft (also known as Sertraline, antidepressant)  
I dont wanna ""relapse"" into telling my parents how im feeling, theyre not giving the support i need, telling me i have everything i need, a roof, ""a stable job"" (which i dont have lol). Thus screaming at me each day, controlling where i am at, not wanting me to play games at all atm, idk.  
Recently got scammed for 40€ online for trying to buy heavier drugs, this shit fucked me up heavily.  


Suicidal Thoughts are really bad atm, used to have passive ones, now active and passive ones.  
Idk, if youre gonna comment, dont tell me to get professional help, its gonna make things worse especially atm, since id probably need to quit my job and end my apprenticeship which are gonna be 3 years wasted then. My parents would be dissapointed and theres no way in hell id be able to keep it a secret from them, they even sometimes follow me around when i go out.  


  
and ik its gonna get better, dont need to say that. theres good and bad but so far my life has been bad, filled with alot of joyful moments, just currently all the worst events are being thrown at me which i cannot handle anymore  


  
i dont do self harm unless my psychological pain is too heavy (usually turns into chest pain and then i get a ""panic attack""?) (only happened thrice, so probably dont worry about this, i dont even cut deep, no scars)  


if ive had a painless way to commit, i wouldve done it already

I don’t doubt that I could eventually get dates but all of that will have to come out eventually because relationships are based on honesty and if I put myself in a good woman’s shoes all of that is going to be a deal breaker because even if a man is the perfect partner now I would never be able to know if he’d relapse and abuse and cheat on me too. The fact that I cheated a second time after having been a good partner for years makes me worried I’d relapse too and I don’t want to hurt anybody else.

Future-Brief-3642,The only time people validate me is when I say I'm suicidal,4,1c66r2v,1,"Title.   


It really sucks because I know that under normal circumstances, they would never agree with what I said. They'd ask me to ""man up"" and take charge of my life.  To ""stop moping and whining about your problems all the fucking time and do something about it for once"".   


Yet here I am on a sub-reddit dedicated to suicidal people. I just.....can't sit around doing nothing and watch myself fall into a bigger hole. I either want to have a good enough life for myself or die. That's why I'm here. To make that choice.  


I am a 19 y/o male doing a double major in a prestigious university. Both my degrees are in STEM. I don't want to elaborate further to preserve my anonymity. I got into this university because the academic calendar in 2022 was fucked up due to COVID. Major exams were delayed as were university admissions. This resulted in fewer applications to my uni and hence I got in with a profile that traditionally would not be considered good enough.   


After coming here, I struggled a lot to compete with the geniuses here (about 70% of my batch can be considered to be part of the ""traditional intake"" of my uni where as the remaining 30% of us got in like I did). Fast forward two years and now I'm at the end of my 4th semester. I have a GPA of 6 out of 10 (The median GPA here is 7.5 and anything below 7 is considered bad). I feel too dumb to do anything with my life. I am unable to grasp the concepts being taught no matter how hard I struggle. It's like I'm watching my life spiral downwards and there's nothing I can do. about it.   


I also have an addiction to porn and masturbation. I use it as an escape from reality. Excessive masturbation has made me weak and very thin. I am easy to defeat in a fight. I barely have the stamina to run more than 500m without getting breathless.  


I have no friends or a social life of any kind because of my inability to keep a consistent schedule owing to certain health issues and also because I can't relate to people in general anymore. Like I don't get how talking bout sex, gossiping about everyone else, joking with dark humour all the time and being pessimistic about everything is fun for everyone. Like I want to talk about our issues in life, our futures and the possibility of doing things that seem magical or unattainable but people just laugh it off or label it ""cringey"".  


I think I'm stuck in a downward spiral and I'll eventually become a financial burden to my parents and friends because if I'm too dumb for college, there ain't no way I'm going to make it out there in the real world where people including your co-workers and bosses can be out to get you.  


That's why I'm slowly getting convinced suicide is the right option. I'm not just saying this after hitting a rough phase for the first time in my life. I'm saying this after struggling for 8 years with an addiction to porn and masturbation. After having been a horrible under-achiever and failure in my academics all my life. After having lost the few skills I had as a child. After having no friends over the last 4 years. After almost 2 years of sleep-less nights spent crying alone in my room or walking alone in the woods desperately praying for a solution to my problems and only ending up in a worse situation.  


I used to say I'll kill myself quite a lot a couple of years back but I didn't have the balls to do it. Now I have a plan and the means and to a certain extent, I also have the courage.    


I am not sure what to do right now.

From 18-20 I was in and out of two relationships, one was for about a year and a half and one was for about 6 months. I definitely jumped into the second one way too fast as a way to get over the feelings of the first girl, hence why it lasted only 6 months.
I was working at Jimmy Johns during these two years, and even though looking back 18-20 isn’t too old to be working in fast food at all, I still felt like a bum.

Anyways when I turned 21 my life changed for the better. One thing I valued in myself is that I can talk to anyone about anything, and I got a sales job selling phone lines starting in December 2022 (now realizing it’s an MLM pyramid scheme) however during the first 6 months I was absolutely loving life. Just being able to put myself out there made me strengthen my social skills so much, and I became the top salesman in the company (out of like 30-35 people) and was consistently one of the best, if not the best. I was building my team of salespeople, building leaders, conducting in-person interviews, and bringing home over $1000 after tax every week.

So May 2022 rolls around and this really pretty girl joins the company, long story short we start dating even though we are coworkers. After we started dating I got hella complacent. A huge red flag that for some reason I completely ignored is in between the first two months of us dating, she tried to overdose TWICE, and her mental health and our relationship as a whole really started to affect me at work. Sales went down, my commitment to the business as a whole went down, and I ended up wanting to break up with her so I could refocus myself on the business but I knew it would be awkward as hell because we were coworkers, and she had no intention of wanting to be my friend after she fell in love with me. So I ended up quitting and going back to fast food. 

During around this time I opened up a credit card and got a new car with a loan of $6000 (now about $5400) and to this day the credit card is still maxed out to this day ($2500) and it’s been hard to pay it off fully but I do have a plan, as I have been delivery driving for the same fast food company and making decent money ($20-25 an hour) while working 45-50 hours a week. I’ve been trying to pay it off as fast as possible except the same car I got a loan for ended up having an insane amount of underlying issues (coolant leak repair, brake pads, transmission mount, new tires) all totaling over $3000 the last 6 months or so.

So now I’m 22 turning 23 next month, have about $7000 in total debt from my car to my credit card and I still owe my dad a couple thousand because thankfully he’s been able to help with some of my car issues. I feel like most of the people my age have their shit together and I’m starting to get suicidal idealtions again because I feel like I’m so behind and I don’t have the drive anymore to pick up the pieces.",1713377366.0,

Slideitinhoney,I’m positive I’m a fuck up and am ready to go.,3,1c67fx3,1,"All my life I’ve been nothing but a fuck up. My sister was perfect, had amazing grades, never got in trouble, was always good at home, went to college has a good job.

I’ve been the opposite, in middle school I barely made graduation at the last minute because I ran around begging teachers to boost my grades, and some reluctantly did. One teacher said he would as long as we promised him that we would graduate high school and I let him down. In high school I was in a illegal business and failed my classes, got into fights and got kicked out. I went to an alternative school and still didn’t try. 

As an adult I was working whatever jobs I could get and I got addicted to oxycodone and xanax. I crashed my car when I blacked out off of Xanax and got a DUI. I was strung out infront of my family and I probably traumatized them. I’m sober now but I’ve already ruined everything. 

I’ve asked my dad if I could go to work with him just to learn how it is and he said all I’ll do is stress him out and ruin his day. My mom has distanced herself and only really shows love to my little sister which I completely understand. My siblings don’t want to talk to me much and treat me like I’m still addicted. 

The only person who still shows me unconditional love is my grandpa. I’ve somehow managed to land a relationship with a woman who makes my days so much better and I love her with everything I have but because of my past trauma from past relationships I always let my insecurities and irrational thoughts get the better of me and I often cause fights. Tonight I caused another dumb one and this time she got really upset and told me she was on the brink of crying.

That was my last straw. I’ve realized that all I do is ruin things and hurt the people that I love. I’m just a carrier of destruction with only one way to be stopped. The thought of removing myself from this world and finally letting the people I love and have hurt, heal and move on with their lives without being held back by me is comforting and makes me confident in the choice to remove myself.

I’ve thought about it and I don’t want to shoot myself and cause a mess for my family to clean up. I hear hanging yourself is extremely painful, I already tried offing myself by cutting my arms open but it was extremely painful and unsuccessful. I’ve decided on ODing. I know someone who sells fentanyl pills and ima take 10 and go to sleep. I’ll wipe my phone before I do so the person who will supply me with the pills doesn’t get in trouble.

p-body-,Being paranoid makes me want to hurt myself,1,1c6fhjt,0,"I am paranoid and I feel like I'm being watched every second. This makes me lose sleep and also always stay in the dark although I still feel paranoid thinking if I'm still being watched Amidst the darkness somehow. I used to feel this way at times but not like this, I'm a continuous manner. I also used to feel like I'm being talked about or made fun of or something like I'm a useless person and nobody wants me and everyone wants to get rid of me. And I still feel that way. I don't know if this comes under bedding paranoid or not. I also feel like someone's heading what I'm saying too and keeping an eye. I know that no one really cares about me and watching me is not worth their time. But I think there's something. My phone's battery is also getting drained pretty soon these days. It happened thrice where I see the battery percentage reducing every second although I'm not using it. My flashlight gets on without anything and sometimes the message I send on WhatsApp is like as if I sent it twice. I don't know if all these things are connected or if it's just me. I'm going crazier each day and I'm not able to stay sane. I am staying with my partner right now but I cannot tell my partner all this. I feel all this to a completely heightened level when I'm here. I wanted to go back to my place where I wouldn't feel all this but overthink. It's not a good feeling but at least I won't feel like I'm being watched or maybe I would now, I don't know. I don't trust anyone or anything. I don't even trust myself. I just feel bad for myself and I'm angry. I don't have any reason. But I want to hurt myself so bad. I just want to jump off the window or cut myself and get it over with all these feelings and thoughts. I just want to feel the pain. I want people to be honest to my face and tell me if there's anything even it'd hurt me or anyone else. At least then the person would be free and also wouldn't be wasting time. Just out of courtesy and respect and because I deserve to know the truth.

Because of my depression and other health conditions, I'm now in my mid 20s with nothing to live for and a future that seems unsalvageable. My biggest problem is I know there's things I can do to better my situation, but I can't get myself to care anymore. I've been trying to fix myself and not fail out of life for years now with trying to pass school, do therapy, take medication etc. but there's nothing that can get me to do anything to help myself. I can't even get myself to apply for a job without feeling like it's impossible. I believe this is because of beliefs I made when I first got depressed that life is meaningless, and whatever I want out of life (girlfriend, good job, friends etc.), I won't get. I've had close friends and therapists tell me over and over that my beliefs aren't true but I can't seem to think otherwise. Yes, I'm not able to predict the future but I'm the one living this life and know damn well what my circumstances are. Even through the times I was to go into remission and not be plagued by anxiety/depression, I wasn't able to achieve anything and just failed over and over and over.

They have another kid, and they barely act like they love me anyway. What about your best friends? They seem to have plenty of other friends, and they get along fine without me now. They’ll be fine if I’m gone. What about your cats? I have a friend who says she’ll take them if it comes down to it. Car? Piece of shit anyway. Apartment?

I have a good life, filled with many success, but everything i care is love. I have not any purpose to live, all my life was just ok until i met a girl, we staid together 7 years before she breaks up. After that i was pretty sure to commit it, but was put in hospital by my family, to be helped. 
The only thing that helped me was a relationship i started with a colleague. I was not into it and was still thinking about my ex fiancee. She had mental troubles and i was not here for her, we had difficulties to make it work and she obviously was not the perfect person to me. I met another girl when i was with her, so i broke up. 

To be short, i am still thinking about my ex, the colleague, we stayed together 2 years. 
I dont know why i am so attached to this girl, i mean, why am i still thinking about her while i left her. I know she's starting a new life, i realised that i'll never see her again and it kills me from the inside. I hurt her a lot, she doesn't want to hear from me anymore. 
My whole life only had meaning through the girls I loved idk why.
Anyway, i lost the last girl i really loved Just because i thought it was better for me to be with a more ''stable'' girl, wich is probably right. But i don't care anymore, i Just never care about life and i know it has to be stopped

I’ve accomplished some stuff in my life and I’m sure my life isn’t that terrible, I’ve got a full ride medical scholarship, I’ve got a house, my parents are well off, I have loads of friends, I get women I’ve had a couple of gfs my life is great by all metrics but none of it ever meant anything. It was always what was expected the norm why would it be any different. Everything changed when I met this girl, now by far she probably wouldn’t be considered the best girl I’ve dated or even the prettiest but something with her was different. I know cliche. We talked for two months and she said she loved me she told her mother and grandmother about me. I met her mother, I’m great friend with her sister, she wanted to go to my uni this coming semester, we wanted to get married (I know it’s fast but in my culture it’s kinda normal) and for the two months we talked I genuinely enjoyed my life. I had something to look forward too. Something to live for. Then I fucked it up, we were still talking as she wanted to wait before we dated but she wasn’t talking to anyone else and neither was I. Until this girl slid into my DMs, now this girl is a 10/10 I’ll be honest but honestly I just can’t be attracted to anyone else and I can’t see anyone else in that way. So I have no idea  why I responded but I did. We chatted a bit and she made it clear she liked me, I told her I was talking to someone but since we weren’t dating I thought it was fine and so new girl. That same night I told the girl I wanted to marry let’s call her T, about new girl let’s call her F. T flipped out and started crying and by the end of the night she had me remove F of everything and then said she needed space but still loved me and still wanted to be with me eventually. Now here’s where I really fucked up, I couldn’t stand the thought of being alone so I reached out to F and for a week we talked and I was honest when T asked about this. Then T told me she needed time and asked if I’d wait. Now the last week without her in my life was the absolute worst of my life and told her this and eventually I told her I’d wait but I would rather I didn’t have to. She told she wasn’t sure about me anymore and didn’t want me to wait when did wasn’t sure I told her that I didn’t care and I’d wait regardless and I blocked F because as great as she is I can’t see myself loving anyone else. (Some context I’ve never loved anyone in my life and I’m the type of person to not even say the words I love you but with T I would want to). Anyways she texted me and she said it’s over between us I essentially begged her to not make that decision now and that id wait as long as it took. That was 2 hours ago, waiting and not knowing is killing me I’ve been sat on the roof about 4 stories up for the last 90 mins. I can’t see myself living without her she means too much to me and it hurt too much. Reading that message put me in physical pain and I havnt stopped thinking about her since I met her but now all I can I think about is how much I fucked how and how stupid I was. I’m genuinely considering just putting an end to it because I can’t keep living like this. I’ve never seen the point in life until I met her and without her I know my life will just be misery. I’m only waiting to talk to her sister and her sisters bf both my freinds to see if maybe there’s a genuine chance. I honestly don’t know what I hope to accomplish by writing this or even if anyone will read it but I can’t tell my friends I’m suicidal and I need to get my emotions and thoughts out there.

nine_tailed_rat,There's no point of my life and everything feels like its over,1,1c6doa4,0,"Already posted about this situation in another subreddit, but I actually am contemplating ending my life. 

I'm currently writing this in some shitty motel. I'm not allowed back in my home as required by the police, and I feel absolutely lost.  
  
To describe the situation, CPS was called on my family as they were teachers in a boarding school so we were residents inside the school. My mother got into an argument with me that ended up physical as per always and someone had overheard. I decided to take it further and file a police report as I had been lacking in food, and proper treatment and constant physical abuse and attempts to kick me out, food was especially an issue on month long breaks for spring, Christmas, and summer breaks since the school provides food for staff and families on school day.  
  
I resorted to selling certain substances in order to sustain my own wellbeing and literally just to be able to fucking afford food. The system f\*cking failed me. CPS came to my parents residential that I live at and the admin who was an ex police detective also came in for questioning but my parents were already at the police station which meant they were only talking to my brother. Admin said that CPS saw a lighter which forced her to check my whole entire fucking room for whatever damn reason when the lighter could've easily been for the candles I have around the room. They found absolutely everything, which I needed to make money for food. But I can't explain that to the cops as selling is still a crime. I have been reported for a class B felony and am not allowed campus so I have nowhere to stay, no family in america, no nothing. My dad is not willing to pay for more than 1 week of some shitty motel so I am contemplating selling my body. I can't make a normal income at a job because I'm 17 which means my parents get access, and they will take almost every damn penny of what I make (which is why I was selling in the first place). I have to sort to illegal business.  
  
To make matters worse, I was considering going to foster care but have been denied all my requests as I was charged with a crime. The cops' only reason for not arresting me is because of my dad's military nepotism. And, the admin told CPS and the cops to ""believe everything this man says"" (referring to my father) which means that everything I told them about the abuse is absolutely meaningless and they're saying that it probably didn't happen because I had ""clouded judgement from all the dr\*\*s"". I have absolutely nowhere to stay, I need to somehow make rent money for my area in 3 days as my parents still have to have access to me as required by cps. The system in the United States is a f\*cking failure, and failed me. I don't know what else I can do to make that money in 3 days (almost 2,000) so if selling my body doesn't work, I'll just end my life at this point. I have only $15 in cash to my name as my parents won't give me a single penny even after selling almost half of my stuff. To make matters worse my parents are trying to convince the cops I stole 5,000 in cash from them, which I doubt they even have or could have afforded since they always blow all their money on themselves.  
  
It sucks too because despite everything going on in my life, I had straight A's, never had disciplinary issues at school, was constantly praised for being a ""fine young lady"" and so this is absolutely horrific. I literally spent two years of my life making prosthetics for impoverished children to out of recycled plastic, helped a school in Kenya called the International school of kenya (which I was attending but faced even more issues with my family, I was also still selling there as they still weren't feeding me) to create tiles and bricks out of recycled waste for residents in the slums to build their houses in sustainable ways at no cost since I raised money for all equipment, and figured out how to build it all cheaper. I had been accepted into college for engineering, but can't even pay for it. I'm literally at such a loss and don't know what to do. If I had extra money laying around and could afford one months rent here then I would have time to figure something out, but no I have only three days. At this point when those 3 days are over I will consider ending my life.",1713369856.0,

I've realised it's gonna be easier to kms than ti actually get help from the NHS. I've begged for well over a year. I can't keep going. Every time they reject me it's just a reminder that I'm worthless and my life isn't worth anything. People say stuff like it gets better and if your younger self could see you now but it's all bullcrap. I've veen lonely and suicidal for over a decade. Im tired of watching everyone else get help knowing that isn't an option for me no matter how much I try, no matter how much I beg, they've decided my life isn't worth saving. It's so hard getting up each day knowing that. I wish I could get better like other people, I'd give anything to get help but they refuse and it kills me.

Unusual-Cow-7163,"Wife told me to kill myself 
",6,1c635t5,6,"

I have been struggling with my mental health the past couple years. Last year took a turn for the worse. My wife lost our baby early in her pregnancy.  Was struggling to make sense of my life in a dead end job. And then in December of last year, 3 days before Christmas,  I was fired, and then my dad dies two weeks after that.
I start wallowing in self pity. My wife, who's very headstrong and Type A , tells me to snap out of it.
I  enrolled into online courses for school to keep me occupied. This way I can keep my depression  at bay.
Then one day my wife and I start arguing for no apparent reason, and she tells me it was ""my fault"" our family is the way it is, and that God didn't give us a baby is because I didn't do my job  as the man of the house. You should just kill yourself.""

I told her I would go to therapy and try to fix myself, even take medication to help my mental illness.
To be honest, I've contemplated just ending my life the past several months, but the thought of leaving my young daughter behind keeps me from doing it.
Even now I'm balling out as I write this. Feeling lost and hopeless. 
I don't know what to do.
Been going day to day, and not knowing if the next day is my last one or not.

UglyGirl83,"I want to end it all… (17, MtF, partially closeted)",1,1c6cav7,2,"So I have 3 friends and unsupportive family. 

First one which I consider my best friend, at least considered. We know each other for 10 years. I had a crush on him last summer and I still have. He came out to me as mtf trans in summer and I used she/ her pronouns on him. But now he still calls himself man, even tho I feel like he’s lying. On his twitter it says she/ her lesbian so I don’t think he is man. But he is probably really scared. I would like to talk to him, but he’s been distancing from me since I came out. I badly want to talk to him, but I don’t know how should I start, and I don’t want to lose this person. He also doesn’t use my new name and pronouns. 

Second one is using my new name and pronouns. He is really perfect friend. I had deep talk with him, and he made me feel really safe and better. He wants us four to go somewhere together, but it is always hard. Because I think we 4 won’t be great friend group. And of course I will be the problem, because every one of them sees me differently. 

Third one is from really conservative family. When I started presenting feminine he used to call me manageress or girl sometimes. He did it for fun, but I liked it. Now as he knows I’m trans, he always calls me ugly girl, for fun of course, but it is so often that it hurts. Today he texted me to play Minecraft, he changed my sign with name over my bed with my “deadname”. I built trans flag and he burnt it. I left and I don’t talk to him, on discord server I told him to fuck off, and we haven’t talked since. And I actually don’t want to, fuck him.

Fuck everything, everyone and I really am at the edge. I have one person who supports me. But he also has his life so I don’t want to bother him too much. I feel like I never be good for anybody. 

I was posting pics on my main acc, and people were actually calling me pretty and passing. So people are the biggest problem now. Dysphoria too, but people make it worse. 

I want to die now.

PrettyComment4079,No more reason to go on,1,1c6c92x,2,"Most of my family is dead or in prison. I'm not in contact with any family members anymore. I couldn't stand being used for all I've got and with nothing in return except having my trust betrayed and my heart ripped out and stomped on over and over again. Favoring the rapists and the drug addicts in the family for reasons I can never comprehend. 

I have zero friends. I sabotaged all of my closest friendships and eventually cut everyone else out to avoid the spiral of self destruction again. I hate doing it and I hate hurting other people. I thought isolating myself would bring peace and make me happy. It didn't. I don't even know how to make new friends. I try but I can't get it out of my head that everyone hates me. I can't relate to anyone anyway. I feel like I don't even live on the same planet as the rest of the world. I know I'm the problem but I don't know how to fix it. 

I can't stay in my relationship anymore. He's not the same person, he's so mean, he's completely irrational, he's going out of his way to hurt me. His dad went to prison for raping his step daughter and since then he completely changed and it is terrifying. I put years of my life into this relationship. I believed that this time was really the one I was gonna build up a peaceful little life for myself. It's like I live with a stranger now that gets off on seeing me upset. I can't handle it. I just can't do this anymore.

It is so scary and I have nowhere else to go. I don't have a car anymore. I don't have any money. I have nobody to talk to. I can't go to therapy. I can't get on medication. I'm trapped in a hell hole with no way out.

I've spent years bettering myself and learning to manage my BPD. To be a better daughter and a better partner. I stopped lashing out, stopped abusing hallucinogens and alcohol, stopped mutilating my skin, stopped crying everyday, I have done everything that was ever asked of me. I have worked to fix everything about myself that caused pain to other people. I wanted to be good enough for somebody. But no matter how much I give, I can't get even a fraction of that back. It really hurts. I've never been self absorbed, I used to pride myself on my loyalty and patience and forgiveness. Now I feel like a fool for letting myself be used by everyone and a terrible person for wanting to be loved by someone.

I've made some horrible mistakes that it looks like I won't be able to move on from. People have been telling me since I was 7 years old that it gets better. It hasn't. I'm almost 25 now. I've given it my honest best effort. It wasn't enough for anyone. I can't do this anymore. I can't stay here and there's no where to go.

There's only one option left. I'm so afraid. But I know if I back out now, I'll only end up regretting it later. If you have a loved on with Borderline personality disorder, I hope you'll reach out to them. A selfish request to the void from someone that's never asked for anything. ",1713366437.0,

Nostalgic_Carrot,Troubled Marriage - Feel like suicide is my only way out,1,1c6a358,6,"In advance - forgive me for my poor description. I am not in any state to be writing in great detail.

TLDR I have been in an abusive (in every possible way, including physically) marriage for about 6 years. My wife beats me without remorse for any mistake that I make. (In fairness, sometimes she exercises restraint, but I never know when it will come, and the violence occurs at least half of the time). When I tell her it is not okay to respond that way she says that I deserve it for making her angry, or for doing something that she has told me she doesn't like. Maybe I am crazy but part of me believes I deserve it. Maybe I do deserve this for always managing to annoy her and ruin her mood. I think there is something inherently wrong with me if I can anger someone to this point on an almost daily basis just by being myself.

&#x200B;

Greedy-Board619,Severity of my mental state is invisible to everyone,1,1c67zdo,0,"(Sorry for the shitty censoring, idk what Reddit allows yet)

Throwaway. M20. I’ve dealt with clinical depression many years now since I was a kid. Some childhood/environmental factors and a couple personality-shifting events but ultimately it’s genetic. Anxiety has gotten absolutely debilitating over the last couple years though. 

I’ve voluntarily admitted myself to inpatient psychiatric care twice after a couple scary incidents involving some bad s ideation. I’ll have periods of time where I’m doing really well for a short amount of time only for me to fall right back down to the bottom.

Part of my issue is my inability to speak up for myself and communicate my needs. Blah blah abusive childhood etc blah blah. It’s almost impossible for me to ask for help or let people know I’m hurting, mostly because I don’t wanna be seen as the person always drowning and always needing a life preserver. I hate the thought of being that kind of person. 

But no one sees how deeply this shit runs. Im not honest with anybody. I’ve never been fully honest with anybody. Not with my therapist. I think about hvrting myself all the time. All the time. In so many ways. Viciously. I think about other people hvrting me. All the ways I could go. In the car, on the street. Recently I’ve realized I may by definition have h0m1c1dal thoughts even though I’d never hurt someone intentionally. Idk how to explain. 

I’m slipping pretty close to addiction and need to be careful. There’s even been a few episodes of intense paranoia too. 

There’s a lot of shame and self loathing. Got a lot of hatred for myself. So that’s another reason it’s hard for me to reach out. 

Idk. Anyone else? Any advice? I don’t know what to do because I feel like I am this close to coming undone and no one even notices.",1713355144.0,

It took me losing the only one I care about and the only person I had to come to my senses. 

I fought against moving with them to a new city where they got a new job. I was hesitant but I supported them going.

When I was 7 my mother abandoned me at my grandmas house and I lived there until I was 11. I am currently 12 years old btw. Last year was the best days of my entire life because I became popular and hang out with friends every week. I slowly started developing a crush for a boy. Before I liked the boy let's name him""O"" I liked another guy let's name him ""J"" I also hanged out with J and O and another girl named ""K"" and a boy named ""W"" sometimes some of us will usually hang out. I remember clearly one time we were at the movies and we were watching Barbie and I was sitting next to O I don't know but I think he actually liked me but at the time I found him weird and just a friend and I also remember him holding my hand on that day.

CormorantTribe,Afraid to talk about my situation ,2,1c63bdr,3,"I've been suicidally depressed since probably sixth grade. I developed crippling anxiety and a lot of sensory issues during my senior year of high school. I think it might be related to a trauma response to some shitty things happening in my family. The anxiety has stayed, and it has grown unbearable.

I can't ask anyone for help. My college roommate is so sweet and caring but I could never trouble her with my problem. She'd never look at me the same. And besides, she has her own family issues and doesn't need to deal with my stuff on top. I don't think she could even help me really, she's never struggled with a mental disorder.

I have an amazing partner that I love to death. He's everything to me. We've been together for about 10 months and I have never felt so alive or at peace as I do when I'm with him. But it's long distance for the time being, since my college is an 8 hour drive away. 

I haven't even told him I'm suicidal. He knew about my anxiety pretty early on, as that's something I'm actually comfortable sharing with people for some weird reason. I've definitely hinted at the depression but never had a super serious talk about it. And I can't even think about telling him I want to end my life sometimes. I don't even know how he'd react.

Honestly, he's the only reason I made it through last summer. I had plans to kill myself after I graduated high school, but then I met him. He changed things. But I'm so afraid of losing him or him breaking up with me, because then I won't have any reason to stay alive.

I know it's not good to prop your entire life up against a person, but it's either that or I have nothing to live for and thus won't. 

Tonight I had a panic attack and an awful breakdown. I cried and hyperventilated and shook in a shower stall for a long time. I had told my partner earlier that I was having a tough time lately (I was super vague, just mentioned I felt like crying), but he didn't really offer help and I don't want to be a burden and ask.

My mind was swarming with bad thoughts and I could not control them. I'm so afraid of these thoughts because I know they could lead to action. I want to die, I suffer so much. But I just can't do it because I'll hurt people. Many people love me.

How do I fix my head? I fundamentally think and interact with the world different than almost everyone. It feels like I wasn't made to live in this world, like all the systems don't fit with me. I've been in college for almost a year and have no friends. My old friends from high school aren't there for me anymore. I've got no one I feel like I can reach out to.

suicide_questioning,Is this actually bad?,0,1c66fd3,9,"Is it actually bad if I give myself a timeline for when to commit suicide?

As it currently stands: I'm 36, no kids, no partner, poor social skills, and no-one interested in me. I've just had my 36th birthday so I've made the decision that if nothing has changed in 2 years, then I'm going to end my life then.

Because I don't want to try and have children without someone whom I can consider a life partner and it will take at least 2-3 years to determine that with anyone. So if I'm 38 and not in a relationship, and with no relationship available, then I'll be over 40 by the time I might be able to have a family which will make me far too old.

So there's no point in worrying at that point about having one. But me giving up on that means giving up on a fundamental life goal, then I don't want to see the following 30-40 years, even if I did have a partner.

On the surface I have it together - graduate degree with no debt, good job, money in the bank, physically fit, close to my grandparents and sibling, friends, hobbies, plans to travel. I have worked so hard to get here.

And I am still so tired.

My mom died when I was 10. My dad became abusive immediately after and spiraled into drugs and alcohol and women. He spent all of the money my mom left my sibling and I and then some. I stayed quiet about the abuse for years under threat of what he’d do to my younger brother, but we wound up in foster care for the next five years anyway. Too little too late for me, I think it saved my brother.

My boyfriend of 5 years recently broke up with me, in part because of how much I was relying on him for my own self worth. I knew I was doing this, esecially toward the end, but I couldn’t stop. There is something fundamentally wrong and twisted in me. The breakup still stings, but the bigger problem is it has sent me right back to being 15 years old in a group home regaling yet another court ordered professional of the assaults and abuse and not knowing whether I’d be sent right back to my dad (again) or to another home (again). 

I can’t live with this. I have tried. I have tried so hard. My brother doesn’t need me anymore. My grandparents would be okay without me. I am so, so tired of waking up and feeling him. It never goes away. I’m always back to being this unwanted, twisted child that ruins everything around me. It’s always there, crippling me even after everything I have fought for.

Please let me go.

slurpeestar,Poverty & disability are going to make me do it,16,1c5ntwl,3,"My husband and I were forced to move out from his parent's house a little over a month ago. I understand they wanted their space, but with the current financial & housing market it's a struggle to find anything affordable. We found one, but honestly it's just barely out of our budget, we didn't have much of a choice though, we couldn't move too far, and we'd rather not be homeless. We're now living paycheck to paycheck and we don't even turn on the lights in the house or use the AC units often. I don't know what we're going to do once summer rolls around, it gets bad here.

The place isn't great. Middle of nowhere, no central AC or heat, there were gas heaters, but they had to be taken out because of multiple gas leaks, we now only have space heaters. None of the windows open, they've been painted shut, and both our neighbors are hoarders, we're surrounded by filth. There's no fence, and wild dogs come and go through it. I even had a pitbull charge at me, had to get my mace. There's no space to cook in the kitchen, and no matter how much we clean there's a constant layer of dust on everything. I hate it.

I'm disabled too, got sick 3 years ago and never got better, now I'm in a wheelchair and doctors never figured it out. I had to stop going to them because I lost my insurance. I haven't been to a dentist in ages too, I have chronic tooth pain as well as pain in the rest of my body 24/7. I got Covid back in January and it damaged my lungs, hospital bills have been a nightmare. I had to go back again last month because I'm STILL having complications from it, I tried to push it back as long as I could, but I got emaciated and started blacking out everywhere. I can't work, and I feel like such a burden to my husband, who's been nothing but good to me.

I'm terrified and don't leave our room anymore. Everything costs money from using the washing machine to taking showers. Cooking to turning on a light to look for something in the dark. I stopped talking to friends and family, I just sit here alone all day everyday now.

I've struggled with my mental health since I was a child, I'm now in my 20s and I genuinely feel like I shouldn't have made it past 18. It's all been downhill since then. Nothing feels worth it, and by next year we probably won't have a place to live and there's nothing I can do about it.

I've tried Medicare and all the free insurance options in our area, I don't qualify because I don't have a diagnosis. I've tried filing for disability, same issue. We don't qualify for food stamps or low income housing either. We don't pay for anything extra, we don't eat out. We stopped going on dates and other than work, my husband doesn't leave the house.

My husband's job is most likely going to go under too, they're underperforming and starting to let people go even though he was just hired a few months ago as a supervisor.

I was doing okay for a while, my mental health was getting better and things were looking up. Then we moved, and now I want to die again. It's not looking up from here, I keep trying to tell myself that it'll get better, but every waking second here is a nightmare. I only want to drink and sleep, but I know I can't do that, it's too expensive anyways.

I don't know how to tell myself to keep going, poverty and disability are going to be the death of me, I can just feel it. I've already plotted out how I wanted to go, I've tried pills in the past but they didn't work, I'm too scared to cut... But there's a train just on the other side of the road, it blares it's horn so loud every hour when it passes. I think about it every time it goes. Only reason I haven't tried yet is because I'm afraid if I somehow survive I'll be an even bigger burden on my family.

Cute-Emu7483,I don't have any fight left.,4,1c5xapm,2,"Life has been an uphill battle for me. So much has happened, and so much is going on at once. Quickly, My mom had me young. She married my ""dad"" when I was in utero. They were divorced when I was 6 months old. Mom started dating my step dad immediately after and my brother came shortly too. Since I was 3, my mom had me competitively swimming. Getting into elementary school I had practice before and after school through high school. When I was 7, my mom got mad at my ""dad"" and told me he wasn't my biological father. It crushed me. From 7-12 I was molested by a family member and nobody ever listened. This person ended up going to prison for SA'ing a minor when they became of age. When I was 8, I watched my 3rd brother be born. Fast forward to the day after my 10th birthday, and that same brother (21 months old) fell in the pool. May 5th he passed, and it was my fault. I was in school when he fell in the pool but I always have carried that guilt, since I had a pool party. That was the first time I saw a dead body, and I held my baby brother when I went into the room with my priest and my ""dad"". This same year in 5th grade, I got ""Disney Dreamer and DOer"" as well as valedictorian. At 11, I tried to commit suicide the first time. I was begging God to let me switch with my brother, he should still be here. Middle school was hell. I was a popular kid, but regardless, it was still rough. I've never been one for drama, and thats all it was. Going into high school I started rebelling. My mom went on family vacas without me, and my ""dad"" got a new girlfriend. My ""dad"" also got married to this gf (+ 3 stepbrothers) where they were expecting my youngest brother. I tried a suicide attempt again because In my mind, my dad wouldn't love me anymore. Kinda goes together because he didn't always make it to my swim meets or extra curricular activities, and for my brother he never misses anything. Also at 15, my mom put me in a childrens home because she didn't want to deal with my depressive/rebellious behavior anymore. I spent Thanksgiving alone with the cook at the Childrens' home. Nobody came to visit me. While I was there, my dog that I had since I was 3-4 years old died. Wild. My mom switched me high schools, and thats when shit really hit the fan. I was introduced to drugs/alcohol and fighting. When I transferred schools, I also lost my virginity just because. It was nothing special. Met my baby daddy at 16, and I was arrested for fighting my mom and had to go live with my dad. Went back to my moms house and back to the high school I started out in. Dropped out the day I turned 18, and my mom also had my bags packed when I got home. I lived back and forth with friends and then I was hit in the head with a tree. I died, broke my C7, 7 skull fractures and an orbital fracture. I was in a coma for about a month. Sever TBI and nothing much was expected from it. However, a few months after I turned 19, I got my HS diploma, started college and got my CNA. Started working at the hospital. When I was 20, I got pregnant with my oldest. Apparently the money I was supposed to get from my brain injury (homeowners insurance) disappeared. Nobody knows where it went. So keep in mind, I'm still poverty poor. Baby daddy left me when I was about 6 months pregnant. No help, nothing. Got an IUD after he was born (can't have BC or anything with hormones). My body rejected the IUD. So now I'm 23. Tore my ACL and have it repaired (Cadaver). Little did I know I was pregnant with baby #2. Found out when I was 3 months along and I couldn't bring myself to an abortion. This pregnancy almost killed me, mentally and physically. The things going through my head were out of control. After my youngest' birth, they tied my tubes. I was super hard on myself because this is baby daddy #2, also. At 24, had two more surgeries. Medical Meniscus, back to back. Between losing my job (ER) to losing my fiance, and getting behind in college, I saved up my seroquel and OD'd. At this time, I had moved in with my grandma. She was out of town watching one of my brothers play college football. She came home and found me, about 16 hours after and I inhaled my vomit. EMS was called and my coworkers picked me up and took me to the ER where I worked at and they said I wasn't going to make it. Was intubated for almost 2 weeks. This wasn't documented as a suicide because I was doing army things. Later that year, I bailed and went to Fort Drum NY. Didn't tell anyone. My family didn't really care, if anything they antagonized my feelings of hopelessness and being alone. Keep in mind I live in a ""small town"" and I'm related to a lot of people. Right after I left. my mother got a hold of baby daddy number 2, and he came and got my youngest. He wasn't on the BC and never knew the kid. He somehow ended up on the BC without my knowledge, Thats when I decided to stay at Fort Drum. I was only supposed to be gone for a short time. Over all this, my grandma was the only one who cared and knew anything. When I was doing army hood rat things (reserves), I was finally over 21 (25 at this time) and without any obligations so I drank. Heavily. All the time. Resulting in two DUIS. I tried to bring my oldest up a few times, but without a support system it was beyond hard. My kids weren't around me when I was drinking. Thanksgiving 2018 was the last time I saw or spoke to my youngest and my grandma. My grandma passed Dec 23, and I haven't been able to cope since. She was my biggest and only supporter. My youngest' dad just doesn't want me to have contact at all. I did a county bullet to get out of a felony. When I was in there, I met the dude I eventually married. I was 29. Nobody called me in the jail, or visited. My family and friends were all in FL. I don't even think anybody knew I was in jail for the longest time. So everybody in the jail thought I was a cop. Undercover. Wondering why I had a southern accent, nobody knew me, I was always being pulled out in the middle of the day (army), and I had privileges. Oh and all my teeth. There was a college class offered there, and I was the TA for the inmates. Thats where I met my now ex-husband. He was the safety blanket because he was the worst one in the jail and was well known. I also was able to see him in person 5x's a week. I got out and he gout out a month after me. We dated and were fine for about 6 months after that, so having been together a little over a year. We got married in June of 2020 when Covid hit. I also started a graduate program. I went home (back to FL) a couple days after we were married and when I got back to NY, he overdosed in front of me. This is when my life started sinking fast. I tried to help him. I had no idea about those kinds of drugs or the lifestyle. He was an IV heroin user. My money started missing, my belongings, the physical abuse and the lies. I moved back to FL, and got my own place. He followed. He was doing alright when he first got here was able to get him a job with my family. However, he started using again. I got him Marchmans acted and that just fueled the fire because then he was able to meet dealers/heroin users. At this time I had my oldest full time (2021) and I filed a custody case for my youngest. I was my oldest' baseball coach, and we were always together. We never were at my house because of my (ex) husband always being high. I was in crossfit pretty heavy and also was finishing my Masters (May 2022). In June of 2022, I filed for divorce and shit hit the fan. My ex husband did whatever he could to sabotage me. My oldest went to stay with my step dad because the abuse was out of control. I was arrested a few different times, for kicking him off my porch (ex husband) and I was arrested for his drugs.--- I'm the only one on the lease and I called the sheriff to get him out of my house because of his drugs. They couldn't verify who's drugs they were but since it was my home I was arrested.--- Sheriffs couldn't remove him from my home, or wouldn't. A few days before this arrest for the POC, my ex husband OD'd me. He put something in my drink and next thing you know he couldn't narcan me back. He called EMS and again, people I knew came. These people knew I was trying to get away from him, and one of them is my good friend. This good friend was trying to figure out what happened especially since my ex husband was pacing while saying ""I didn't mean to do it, I didn't mean to do it"". Was taken to the ER I used to work at years before, and they released me. I wasn't marchmans acted because they all know I don't do drugs. During all this, I had a job as a substitute as well as worked at another facility (Advent). I resigned from both jobs. DCF now is involved because of the arrest. Oh, I'm also in a PhD program. CJ/Behavioral health. The poss. charge ended up being dropped. DCF required me to do all the evaluations without finding anything mentally wrong. Also did SA evals as well as random drug screens for a year and a half. Passed every one, and no SA issues. I also was arrested a few more times for driving on a suspended license, regardless of the paperwork I had to say otherwise. Had insurance, tag, title and registration all only in my name (through USAA). Last November after all this, I had a mini stroke. I've taken off from school. DCF placed my oldest with my parents, and they couldn't follow court orders so they placed him in foster care. I got an injunction and a divorce in 2023. Ex husband just got out of jail for violating the injunction twice. DCF also got my oldest' father involved, who was absent for 10+ years, and reversed the order where he signed over his rights. I asked for family therapy because of the trauma the both of us went through and witnessed. Because I challenegd the DCF workers and cursed them to no end, they went to an emergency hearing where instead of unsupervised visits, they ordered therapeutic visits for one hour, once a month. The last time I talked to my oldest was last May (2023). So with all this, heres the issues I'm facing now.....

&#x200B;

I had court for my oldest last Thursday. His dad wants child support from me, and I have never received a dime. My oldest went to him over the summer. They moved him two counties away. I still can't drive. I told my mom to never speak to me again, given she doesn't do a thing to help but always tells me ""Not my problem"", ""I'm not discussing this with you"",etc etc. I can't get a job to save my life, granted I'm related to the whole damn town and my resume is too extensive. Plus, with this suspended license charge over my head, I won't pass a background. My youngest' dad has dragged this out too and both baby daddies are doing the same thing to me in courts. I'm not taken classes again because I can't afford it, let alone barely pay my necessity bills. I have no friends. A lot of the friends I had, had kids also. Without kids, I have nothing. People my age single without kids go to bars, and I don't care to drink or hang out there. My family is all around me, and I don't get invited to anything. Holidays, birthdays, etc. Shit, my brother got married in November and it was apparently made to me that I was not allowed. I'm the only sister. I honestly have nobody. My self sabotage is through the roof. I don't enjoy anything anymore. Music, I turn off because I shouldn't be allowed to enjoy that. TV, same. My whole family is wealthy. Like, stupid wealthy. Won't even lift a finger to take me to the store. They live right around the corner. I've come to the conclusion, I am an awful person. I must have done something so asinine that nobody is willing to be in my corner. I never abused, neglected or abandoned anyone. (My kids were with my grandma when I went to NY, my mom showed up one day and decided to pull the plug). There is no making anything right. I can't deal with this life anymore. There is no purpose, promise or silver lining. In any direction. I've tried to fight. This isn't mental illness either. This is circumstantial. I'm not willing to wait years for this to ""get better"" where I will have a young adult come to my door asking me ""why?"" and they've developed mental issues on their own. On a side note, my animals love me and thats whats hurting the most. I have a mustang who was abused and didn't like any human until he came to me. My dog won't leave my side.  1) nobody will miss me when I'm gone 2) it will be a relief of a burden to many 3) I will be at peace for the first time in my life 4) I don't want to get old and decrepit, and be stuck on a bench 5) I wont hear ""You aren't my problem"" or ""You aren't my kid"" anymore.

This isn't a cry for help, but a paper trail. Good night

There are people in my life who love me (which is more then I can ask) so I can’t talk to anyone in my real life about this I’m not really sure why I’m typing this now maybe I just need to someone to know I was here, that I tried.

I’m 23F at the age of 7-9 I was molested and raped by my biological father. (no longer in contact haven’t been since I was 9) the first few times it happened I made sure my mom knew because as ‘normal’ as my father tried to convince me the acts were it still always felt wrong, she either didn’t believe me or maybe was just too young to know what to do either way I’ve forgiven her and we’ve moved on from it 

At the age of 16 I met a man who was 25( he was a lier but we’ll get into that) at first he was perfect gentle and caring with me. in the moment I didn’t realize how mean he got but looking back on it I know where I should’ve walked away (the beginning) he’d take care of me, feed me, spend money on me, then he’d beat me and when I’d pass out he’d rape me . I didn’t know what a dom/sub relationship was at the time but that’s what he made us (he wasn’t a real dom just a man who enjoyed hurting the people who love him) we were together longer then I’m proud to admit but during the relationship I got pregnant, when I told him he panicked and flipped on me blaming it on me cheating (really he was scared of going to jail) he beat me again hoping to force a miscarriage it didn’t work but that was the one that put things into perspective for me, I didn’t feel worth the breath that filled my lungs but now I was making life, I was doing something beautiful and wonderful and sinless I thought I’d done something so good and still he put his hands on me. After that I left it wasn’t that simple though he would never leave me alone, about a week later I ended up miscarrying 

At 17 after suffering my first misscarge I tried to take my own life obviously failed my family found me and I was put on suicide watch 24/7 and therapy three times a week I slowly got better I graduated highschool and went to college it wasn’t easy and I ended up leaving that program for another where i graduated and at 19 I start a career in healthcare making the most of my friend group with my own apartment and car debt free at 21 

At 22 I met my fiancé(25 at the time) I didn’t pay much attention to men until I realized just how lonely having peace was is gotten so used to being alone that the quiet stopped bothering me but still like anyone else I wanted my person Que my fiancé, we met in that time When I didn’t want anyone but he never missed an opportunity to ask me out I’d turned him down multiple times until finally we met, we spent hours together talking and laughing hours and hours having a good time by the time we parted ways that night he’d asked me to be his girlfriend and I went with it, we spent everyday after that one together enjoying each other, we got engaged after our 6 month anniversary (fast Ik) and we were madly in love we decided to wait to get married just because I wasn’t ready. November 23 2023 he left home with his bestfriend ‘S’ (28M) to meet another bestfriend ‘A’(28M) to preform and party at a club downtown  (all three grew up together) and never returned, he was shot in the back of the head by ‘A’ over a fight they’d had three months prior paramedics said he was dead before his body hit the ground, that it all happened so fast he just dropped. Another friend ‘R’  tried to give him CPR but said his eyes where already rolling back in his head. He was gone 

It’s now been 4 months since he died and I’m tired, I’ve picked myself up and dusted myself off before but now many more times can I hurt in this life time before I’ve hurt enough.

So tonight’s the night Ive got about 12oz of antifreeze and a couple energy drinks(no real reason just better flavors then soda) that take the bitterness away a bit hopefully that’ll be enough 

I don’t need anyone to tell me there are people who love me, believe me I know and I hope they can find it in them selves to forgive me I just needed to get it off my chest

But I got a lot on my plate. And I just can’t seem to catch a break. I’m just tired and feel like ending it all and have been looking at ways to do it painlessly.

He’s hurt me in so many ways. I’m still in the middle of trauma therapy. It’s been a year since we separated and I still feel like it’s never going to be over. 

I’m drowning. He won’t pay spousal support and there’s nothing I can do. I can’t afford my attorney without it. He took years of my life away and I’m trying to pick up the pieces but it’s like none of them even fit together. 

He’s still hurting me and no one will help. The “resources” they say are out there? They don’t exist if your husband has the right job and the right people looking out for him. My advocate can call anyone until she’s blue in the face but somehow? He always wins. 

One year ago today, I started planning how I’d kill myself to get out of this relationship. I failed. 

I wish I hadn’t. I can’t tell anyone because then they’ll send me away and I really will lose everything. My options are to end it myself or let him bully me to death. He cut me off from everyone I know. Everyone I loved. The worst part is? The ones left, my own blood, blamed me and turned on me for leaving.

Lanky_Wasabi7424,Eyes wide open,3,1c5y720,1,"Years ago, I was asked by a drunk stranger in a smokey bar what I thought my life was worth. It wasn't a veiled threat, but rather a philosophical question posed by a man who had too much to drink. Looking back, I'm sure he was fishing for some profound answer or perhaps even hoping to provoke an epiphany of sorts. I provided neither. Instead, I spit out a witty response. 
""That depends on how much you're willing to pay for it, I suppose,""  I chuckled. ""What's your offer?""
He seemed satisfied with my attempt at comic relief, and our brief interaction ended with my next beer on him. 
I am now decades removed from that moment, but if I were to walk into the same bar and be asked the same rhetorical question by the same man, my answer wouldn't be the same. It would be much more arbitrary. 
""About four grand,"" I would reply. ""$3,800 to be exact.""
That, my reddit friends, is what my life is worth or perhaps the more specifically the amount needed to make my life worth living. 
I'm not going to go into intricate details about what brought me to my present predicament because, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. And I'm not going to entertain the thought that my life will get better because it won't. And I am not soliciting financial advice because trust me when I tell you that I have exhausted every possible option nor am looking for handouts because I don't deserve any.  It is safe to say that I can not dig myself out of this hole. I have succeeded in burying myself figuratively. My only way out of it is to bury myself literally.
I'm sure I will be told that ""Money isn't everything"" and be offered another proverbial anecdotes such as ""Money can't buy happiness"" or ""Where there is muck, there is brass."" I know money isn't everything. Honestly, I don't care much for it. I never have. I also know that money does not guarantee a good life, but it certainly helps. And I absolutely know you have to work for things in life. I would love more than to pull myself up by the old bootstraps this time, but, alas, I can not. 
So what's a middle-aged girl to do? 
Unless you've carried the weight of financial problems, you have no idea how heavy it is. It is crushing, in fact. And it is as daunting as it is cumbersome. I feel as if I spend most of my time on a tightrope, forced to take shaky steps and struggling not to plummet. I exist in a constant state of panic, unable to eat, unable to sleep, unable to breathe, really. I am suffocating. Sometimes, it feels I am being slowly snuffed out, as if I am running out of oxygen in an airtight vault. Other times, it feels like the air has been sucked out of my lungs in one sudden and violent jerk, as if I have been plunged into icy, artic waters. 
Either way, I am on the verge of asphyxiation, and I have no one to blame but myself. Sure, I have had bad luck, but I have also made bad decisions. And while I may not be solely responsible for my financial situation, I do hold myself most accountable, copping to the pivotal role I have played in it all. That perhaps is the most unbearable component of all, being cognizant that choice not chance led me here. I used to say that failure isn't the worst thing a person can live with, that regret is much, much more bitter pill to swallow. But I can tell you from experience that they are equally as wretched. 
I so wish someone in reddit land could swoop in save me, but the sad truth is, I can't be saved. I am irrevocably irredeemable and unrescuable. And frankly, even if I could be saved, I neither expect it or nor am I entitled to it. 
The ephiany that eluded me decades ago in that smokey bar, no longer does. My eyes are painfully wide open.

I lived in my last town for close to 10 years and never made a single friend. I spend my weekends crying and getting high. When I was younger I thought I would find my place in the world but I do not really believe that anymore. My mind is a clusterfuck of bitterness and envy. 

I have always been scared of death but lately it's starting to look like a very appealing option. No more crying myself to sleep. No more envy and loneliness. No more attempting to fit in. No more trying and trying and trying just to stay afloat. Just blissful nothing.

In the past I thought that in order to take my own life I would need to hate myself hard enough, but lately I have felt a weird sense of compassion towards myself. This life wasn't meant for me and that's ok. Maybe not everything is my fault, maybe I wasn't given all the tools I needed to navigate life and relationships, and that's ok. 

We treat death like this big scary monster but if you see it from another perspective it's just peace. I did some research and decided I will order a helium tank and a CPAP mask.

Currently I'm finishing up my first year and am finding myself in the same position as last year - stressed and out of my mind regarding career prospects. I'm not happy with the pay or the length it takes to finish medicine - I didn't take this stuff much into consideration when I picked it as studying mefdicine was the only thing that I wanted last year.

Currently I'm debating three options - continuing medicine, dropping out and pursuing software engineering (better pay, shorter years, less stress), or killing myself. I'm starting to come to terms with the last option as of late, and I think it's the best descision for me.",1713338587.0,

Unknownxsecretx,Can’t stop self harm and I really want to get better,0,1c63k6q,2,"Context: I’m a 23 year old guy. I’ve tried to end it all 2 times since the last week but I’m just too scared and I can’t seem to do it. But my pain is reaching a tipping point and I feel like I might pull the trigger tonight. 

The root of all problems is that I cannot accept myself or the way I look to be specific. I started hurting myself because I never felt good enough, there’s always someone better looking out there and even though I tried to tell myself that I’m enough, my inner demons just got the better of me. I’d spend countless hours crying alone, having to friends or anyone to talk to. My girlfriend cheated on me for two years straight and that further added to my trauma. And when I did find the love of my life, I pushed her away due to certain circumstances that I could have avoided easily. Things are so bad that I can’t even go out in the public without getting a panic attack and crying uncontrollably. I’m a terrible person and I want to get better, I really tried but no matter what I do, I won’t be able to be the best in the world or change whatever has happened. Is there a way to deal with self-doubt and constant self-hatred? 

I really don’t want to hurt myself anymore but I can’t stop doing it. I’ve spoken to a professional and that only made things worse because of an argument that I had.

BeautifulEarth8311,I did it to myself ,3,1c5wxkf,0,"I was a heavy drinker for many years masking undiagnosed autism, trying to fit in, not seeing consequences for my peers so expecting none for me. It was bad enough how I must up the exterior of my life-lost jobs, opportunities, relationships, consequences but then the interior became a prison I can no.longer exit. 

First it was just detox and I remember the superhuman relief when finally liberated. It was a better high than drinking. Then it was hospitalizations because I couldn't safely tiugh it out on my own anymore. Alcohol became a prison. The thing with alcoholism is that it sneaks up on you. Eventually you cannot let your back drop or you go into detox while still drunk. You beg for a drink. Rationally knowing this isn't a logical plan but desperately trying to to stave off the detox symptoms that feel like hell on earth and may kill you. 

The last time I drank I knew I would never touch the stuff again. I was so totally abd completely over it. I had so many good things lined up just waiting to be seized but on that fateful day I foolishly picked up my drink locking myself into a month long binge. Maybe longer. I don't know. I tried to get treatment but the hospital refused me meds because of the opioid crisis. What that has to do with an alcoholic trying to detox I'll never understand. That one decision by hospital staff sealed my fate. I had to keep drinking until, in my alcoholic stupid, I found a place forty five minutes away that would medically detox me. I do remember calling the same lady several times because I couldn't remember what I was doing. She was the only one to show me any kindness and gently remind me I had already called and give me the information again. 

All because the hospital in my city wouldn't detox me I ended up on an overnight month long bender only to finally land in the hospital with several inflamed organs. The doctor preferred I stayed inpatient for detox but I was drunk and I hate hospitals so I said if he was fine with me detoxing at home I would prefer it. Probably a stupid decision though I'm not sure he would have treated me better inpatient. Inpatient detox is hell. You are trapped in a hospital bed in a loud, extremely cold hospital sweating out your withdrawals and usually restricted on medication to only give you enough to fend of death seizures but not enough to actually starve off symptoms. That's why I preferred to go home. At least I could turn the heat up. Take a shower. Have more than one shaggy prison blanket. 

The detox was hell. I couldn't seem to pull out of it. I finally did only after having my entire life collapse around me. 

But, the symptoms slowing creot in until I was completely disabled. I felt my nervous system meeting but had no idea how to explain this to any doctor. And I figured if I did they would just write it off to anxiety, which they did. I asked for nutritional testing, which they denied and told me diet would somehow correct the obviously severe deficiencies I was now experiencing. 

I tried alternative doctors to only receive incorrect treatments and worse reactions and symptoms. 

I eventually began treating myself. But, of course, a severe deficiency that melts your nervous system is no easy thing to pull out of. The reactions to therapy became worse than the illness. At least as bad and now, five years later, I'm still disabled. My nervous system is still messed up. Doctors still write it off to anxiety even with my medical history and I feel backed into a corner. 

I felt suicidal for years. I couldn't figure out how to do life or even enjoy it. I guess I'm a cliche because since this illness I have so much live for life. I desire it. I don't want to die. But I have no quality of life. Not only do I not have any quality of life but my body is a literal torture chamber. I feel like I'm trapped in alcohol detox hell permanently. I guess that's my karma if you believe in that sort of thing. I'm just heartbroken that now that I finally want life I may have to leave it. 

Abd I'm terrified of that prospect. My faith brings me comfort in this life but, honestly, I'm like anyone else and I have my doubts. I also have my fears. What if there is a hell and I send myself there? Or, perhaps worse, I muck it up and end up in even worse shape in this life. I don't even know how to do it. I have no plans. I feel so trapped abd scared and I just have to go through each day like this day in and day out.

i have tried every medication under the sun, therapy for 20yrs, tried religion, tried support groups, and have even had multiple VOLUNTARY psych stays. i'm trying so hard to want to be here but every day feels like i'm kicked so much farther from any level of happiness.  
a large majority of my mother's side of the family have committed suicide and it just feels inevitable. it feels like a curse and i have done everything i can to break it but i don't know what to do anymore. i am so tired.  
i keep hearing about euthanasia in europe and how a lot of these people have the same diagnoses that i have and that may be what has brought this on harder but genuinely, i do not think i can keep going.  
i have no support where i live. i have never even had anybody love me unconditionally. i'm fairly estranged from my family. like nobody would miss me if i just did something right now.  
i don't want to try another psych stay. i don't want to try anything anymore. i want to just go to sleep and be done.   

please tell me that any of you have gotten past this level of mental health because i need some hope that maybe things might get better. i can't keep doing this.

I’m a 22 year old male from the US and these last 6 months have been the lowest in my short time here. I’m a single dad to a handsome 1 year old boy.  I work long hours  in public safety to provide the best life I can for my son. About 5 months ago I separated from my high school sweetheart and love of my life who I had every intention of marrying and doing life with. In the last 1.5 years of our relationship it was far from perfect, she cheated on me multiple times, showed me less attention, and constantly lied. She cheated on me with a variety of different co workers, stayed out at the bar while I was home with our son. I finally had enough after I caught her at a guys house right around the holidays, i told her I was done. Her family was well aware of all of her escapades and supported my decision, it’s been very difficult for me trying to get over this. She really isn’t much help with our son at all; I’ve got him primarily. I can’t seem to get over the idea of her, driving down a road I see memories appear in my head like a slideshow. I recently found out she is pursuing a relationship with the 4th guy I caught her cheating with, and has brought my son around him. It is destroying me on the inside. I not only lost the love of my life but I lost an entire family who I love. I often have thoughts of ending my life to stop the pain. I don’t want to die, but I’m tired of feeling the way that I feel, it is pure torture. I was very close a few weeks back, but someone called me and it stopped me. I often lay in my bed at night contemplating life, following it with the uncontrollable cries of missing feeling happy. I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m losing myself. I had plans to propose to her in Tennessee last December, now she acts like I don’t exist anymore. Any man who says he is perfect to his partner isn’t telling the truth, I wasn’t perfect but I surely treated her like my queen. It just seems now that not waking up would be something I want. She isn’t the only reason I feel this way, it’s a large chunk of it though.

BigContribution2259,Hopeless.,6,1c5n12z,0,"This might be a long post, and this is indeed a throwaway account. I've been feeling hopeless lately, my life has been painful for me, there's definitely people out there who's experienced more hardships, and it adds on guilt. When I was a kid I would always get hit by my parents, whenever I cried, they'd hit me till I stop, whenever they didn't like how things were going or how I acted, they'd hit me. The hittings would go from the belt, a stick, straight up punches, I've been chocked, at one point dad got on top of me and put my arms in a lock so I couldn't block his punches and felt so defenseless, he did that because I pushed him when I had enough. They made me feel so little and that feelings don't matter. It kept going till I was 19 (I'm 22, about to be 23 in a couple days). Outside of my house life it was equally worst, I was bullied and I felt so different from everyone, I also got in fights. Growing up I felt like I don't deserve to be liked/loved, my first relationship I was lied to, and I'll admit, I've messed up in relationships, I kept trying to be better. I chased someone who kept flirting back with me only to feel like a third wheel. I tried committing at age 19 by hanging, it failed since the necktie broke. 

Now I've been in this one relationship for 11 months now, first time I've been ever happy, now it's all crashing down, and I'll admit it was because of my doing. I made her unhappy, I lied to her, I overstepped her boundaries, I made her feel disrespected, I put people before her, I emotionally neglected her. To give more info I was recently diagnosed with BPD (Borderline personality disorder), I don't want to use it as an excuse because, that was my own choices, I take accountability for it. After a while I attempted again a few months ago, through pills, this time I got rushed to the ER and got help. I accepted their program because I want to be better for me and my partner. I thought things would become better, but karma definitely hits when you've hurt someone so much. She's unhappy, and now I feel like that one person who finally made me happy, will leave me soon, I destroyed my own happiness and her happiness, the happiness I've been looking for ever since I was a kid.

Now I feel incredibly hopeless, no future in sight, unhappy with myself, and I really just want to end it. My plan is on my birthday, which I don't really celebrate, I'll end it, I'll end all this pain and maybe, I won't be unhappy anymore. It all just hurts and I want to finally rest, I know it'll affect people around me the friends I made and supported me, my family, my little sister, but I'm tired, I want to rest, I'm hopeless and everything just hurts.

When I look back to everything and even now I feel like nobody truly loves me. I just don’t know what else to do. I’m so generous and kind to my friends and all. Like those outside relationships don’t even matter to me now because of what is going on inside my family. I don’t know why everything fell apart. My mother got really sick when I was about 9 and I was constantly worried about her and when my dad would leave for work I’d beg him to stay and chase  after him. As years went by I stopped responding to my mother’s symptoms too and I feel like I’ve become so heartless. She always tells me that I deserve to burn in hell and all those things for being disrespectful when I am just trying to express my opinion. My dad blames my mom for leaving his parents to die in his country. And I always felt somewhere along those years he stopped loving me the same and I recently found out that it was after my grandparents death. Last week when my brother got arrested for some stupid reason he called and screamed at me for not staying at the police station and begging them to not take my brother. I told him calmly that they would’ve taken him anyway. Then he screamed at me saying “how can I feel anything for you? When you did not help to bathe your grandmother? You were in 5th grade and when I called you, you just sat there.”  And I wasn’t that surprised when he said that but it still hurt me so much because he confirmed what I’ve known all along, that he didn’t feel anything for me as his daughter. I already knew my mother didn’t love me like other mothers. So I came to realize that nobody is guaranteed to love you in this life not even your own parents. I didn’t know if my will to go on and live got any lower after that because it has been that way for so long. But yeah he screamed at me after that saying that I hate God because I don’t wear the headscarf. So I started wearing it after that day because he kept saying how he’s ashamed to even go near me when we’re outside since I look like a disbeliever. I dress modestly but do not cover my hair because I am just not used to it to be honest and I don’t feel like I deserve it since I am not very knowledgeable in my religion. And I was trying to convince myself that I did a good thing and I did but idk. Today I took it off and looked at the mirror and started crying because I have to wear it forever now. And I know it’s normal and will take some time to get used to. But I feel like I’ve lost myself completely. I want to block all of my friends and just keep existing I guess. I’ve always wanted to be with someone who truly cares about me just like everyone else. However, my parents and my whole moms side of the family wants me to marry my cousin. And I was 17 when I went to their country and they pressured me into talking with him. He’s the complete opposite of what I want. While all of my friends and my peers are going to college this year, I’ll be going back to my country. I am so scared that they’re going to try to marry my off and pressure me. I don’t think I’ll have the will to just keep going under those circumstances. I am truly truly tired. I feel like I’ll look back and regret that I have spent so many years being sad. I just want to feel something, anything but sadness. I prayed and asked God to just please kill me because I cannot do it myself since that would mean I would go to hell. I don’t want to continue living in hell. My dad has always criticized me for having dreams that do not align with his beliefs. Or even wanting to live a certain way. Now I look around people and I think that their lives are literally pointless from what my father has described. I am truly tired. My academic performance has been very very poor. My parents do not care about it since I am a “girl” and with all the friends I’ve had in the past and just everything I’ve been influenced by I missed out on some stuff. I remember I had so so so much potential and it hurts me so much that I’ve killed it. I do not have the energy or even the motivation to take control of my own life. The person that they want me to marry knows about how my personality is like this. That’s why he’s so insistent on marrying me so that he can mold me into his perfect little wife. I can’t even think about the kind of life that awaits me. I know many people have more experience in life than me.

Frequent_Mess_3900,Extremely disconnected to everything and everyone ,2,1c5uv35,2,"The brain fog is so brutal, and so embarrassing. Sometimes I can’t process even the simplest of information, as if I’ve popped into existence/consciousness as a fully grown adult only a few days ago. 

I really need to connect with others, but I’m not capable of it in my current mental state. I am so disconnected to everything around me, it’s extremely painful. 
I recently dated a beautiful man, but my brain fog was so strong I could not be present with him at all, so he rejected me. I made myself look so bad and so stupid. 

Having a really good relationship would actually save me but I’m too fucked up to be present enough to ever develop that with someone.

I have little to no interest in pursuing much of anything. If I ever do pull that off myself, that interest goes away. It’s completely pointless for me to pursue any interest because sooner than later, the interest is completely gone. Thinking about pursuing anything at all only fills me with fear and dread. I always end up disappointed with myself. 

Why can I not be normal and keep any interest?

I also don’t have any friend to lean on… the lack of connection to others makes everything so much more painful. 

I feel so incapable of developing a good friendship, because my mind is extremely messy and sensitive. It’s very cluttered and empty at the same time.

All I have are my immediate family members, but it’s so embarrassing letting them in on my emotional suffering. Opening up to them about this also brings them pain… it’s like I have to be selfish and break their hearts for them to know what I’m going through and maybe get me the help I need, because I sure as fuck can’t save myself.

It’s very likely I will not receive the help I need, and I will resort to suicide. I may actually do the most painful thing against myself and the few people who love me, to end my very long-term suffering. 
What is the point of going on existing when you’re hurting so much and for a seemingly endless amount of time? What is the point when you really try saving yourself so many times, but you just fucking can’t?

Suffering with long-term (undiagnosed) depression has turned me into a significantly dumber person. I would absolutely not survive without my family. 
I also feel too far gone, like I’m at an irredeemable point. Like suffering for so many years has caused enough brain damage that I will never be a normal person. I genuinely believe this.

I have been medicated for 7 years and I got back to college lost my mind and got on pills again then rediagnosed with mood disorder to bipolar 2. i stopped taking pills after 3 months and was fine, and then I just dealt. The last time I attempted I tried to hang myself and couldn’t. Tried dying from slicing my wrists and bleed out but it didn’t work.

I cannot end up in a psych ward because then I would just want to kill myself even more. Which is why I never told my therapist. I don’t believe in therapy because my therapist abandoned me after 7 years because I was “too much”, fully knowing I have abandonment issues.

AMOURGAY,Im losing my mind. I cant handle the pain much longer.,2,1c5tz6y,0,"
Hi everyone. Sorry for the extremely long post, or if any of this sounds weird or contradicting, but I've been struggling with these thoughts for months, and it's been getting worse. I really feel that this is the only place where I can let things out.

I can't help but feel that life just seems all painful and morbid and that it's all just one big competition that we cant trust each other in, so I feel that everyone only acts in their own interests. That in addition to knowing that for someone to win, there has to be someone else who eats the mud and gets labelled a loser just makes me feel horrid. and that no one really cares or listens. Because of that, I fear that by opening up to people I know in person, because I'm going to be vulnerable, and someone is going to take advantage of that. 

Knowing that some people are living miserable lives; whether they suffer from terminal illnesses, are in debt, or are homeless, that others died miserable deaths, lots of unanswered cries, or that there are lots of evil people is just crushing. How can I live happily knowing all of that pain and agony is out there? I know its impossible to help everyone, fix everyone and their problems, nor is it my responsibility, but that just feels so selfish and cruel. 

Sometimes, I try to see the good in some people, and convince myself that theyre better than they seem, that they have good intentions, but more often that not, I end up empty handed and feeling shattered. Other times, I always doubt other people's intentions after their kind words or actions. I'm afraid they have some sort of ulterior motive. Am I too full of myself for thinking about others like that?

Speaking of myself, I'm so untalented and unintelligent and that it's laughable. I lack creativity, I cant draw, write anything thats been done a million times before, neither am I athletic. I've tried playing basketball for some time, it didn't take me long to quit. I always get tired too quickly, I'm too stiff and I didn't feel the reward. I also learnt too slowly, and everyone around me was better than I am. I suck at almost every game I play and if do improve, its nothing crazy and theres not much improvement afterwards. If anything, my peak is just considered an average/casual player's skill level. I feel like I want to do everything, to be everything: a writer, a composer, a developer, an athlete, the list goes on. I have too many goals, but theyre all goals I'm passionate about and I don't know which ones do I really dedicate to. The funny thing is, I suck at them all. I even daydream and talk to myself or imagine talking to others with no end goal when I'm stressed or bored, and I waste too much time doing it. It's embarrassing.

When it comes to school, I'm not any good either. I can't focus, I'm very slow at learning, and all my classmates are just better than I am. It makes me feel devastated. To make things even worse, I have 4 major exams in a month, and I'm really not ready for them. I will admit I am to blame due to some procrastination, but at the same time I genuinely doubt I was ever smart enough to do well in them anyway, especially maths, contrary to what my parents always tell me. I know that if I try asking my parents that I'm going to have to do them later so I'm more prepared, they will make my life a living hell worse than it already is. 

My parents often insult and belittle me, and scream at me. Do I deserve it sometimes? Yes. But most of the time their blood is boiling because of me over really petty things. They  also constantly force me to do things their way. For example they just refuse to believe that studying using electronics is any good, although it has greatly helped me before, and they also force me to study their way (whatever that means) , which I end up benefitting almost nothing from. I tried asking telling them about my struggles, I'm not sure if that helped. I tried asking them to book me with a therapist or a psychiatrist, they agreed but then forgot about it the very next day. (Using a hotline sounds so awkward and embarrassing, just like seeing a therapist, and aren't much of them where I live, but I'm really afraid that using one of them would get me in trouble.) Not to mention how they always blame me for my siblings' mischief or refuse to treat them their age. No way can I bring myself to hate my parents, I can tell they really do care for me. It's just don't know how to explain how I feel about them.

I'm such an clumsy and uninteresting person, I make lots of impulsive decisions (especially purchases) that I end up regretting mere minutes later. Sometimes I feel awkward and try to force myself to fit in with a lot of people. I do have some friends that I relate to and can be comfortable around (to some degree) but even then, sometimes I'm just never in the picture. I even get ignored sometimes when were talking to each other. Another thing I noticed is when I'm alone with one of them, its basically silence. But when even two of them are with each other, theyre doing all sorts of things. Am I thinking in a self centered way again?

Also, looking back at my past, I have tons and tons of regret and things id like to forget. I'm always in fear that its going to haunt me very soon, even though I believe I've changed and learnt from these mistakes. 

I know I can be better than this, but at the same time I can't do it whenever I try, and I just end up quitting. Im that fucking pathetic and untalented
I've tried to multiple times before, but I keep chickening out when it comes to killing myself. I've been like this for many months and I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to just doing it. I dont know what to do anymore. I'm losing my mind and I want it all to just stop.

I can’t hold on anymore, but I also cant help but worry about her constantly. It’s selfish, but all I want is for her to be mentally stable before I kill myself, and that feels like it’ll never come.

I accidentally got her into self harm. She’s 15, but she feels so much younger than me when it comes to this. I try to help, but she just gets worse.

I can’t fix myself, I’ve tried for years. But all my attempts at making sure she doesn’t make the same mistakes as I have been futile so far.

I just can’t take anything anymore. At least this year so far, I’ve never had more reasons to end it all. Sorry for the long post.",1713271610.0,

slackervi,i wonder when exactly did i doom myself to be this way,2,1c5q0bc,0,"i wasn't always this pathetic and miserable. i mean i always felt like i am an outsider but i always found a way to cope with it in one way or another. but when did i turn into whatever the fuck i am right now? when did i ruin my life? i already wasted my childhood by being a miserable loser and i am now wasting away my youth by being this way. 

maybe i just have to be this way for my entire fucking life. and i just can't keep living if that's the case. i wish a train would fucking hit me because i am too pathetic to actually kms. i just wanna be in peace forever and i just wish i was never born. i wish i was aborted, i wish someone stabbed me, i wish someone threw me from a building. i wish i could just be killed. 

sure some will be upset about it for a few days or weeks. i know my friends and family (especially my mum) would be miserable for awhile. but eventually everyone will move on no matter what. i'll be probably be talked about for awhile and be thought of as that guy who killed himself at a young age but eventually i will be lost to time and be forgotten.

or actually would anyone even miss me? i can't see anything in myself for someone to like me enough to miss me. all i see is a pathetic, spineless, miserable, resentful, pretentious, envious excuse of a subhuman. maybe they'd be glad a bastard like me is finally gone and they don't have to act like they like me out of obligation anymore.

who knows maybe that isn't exactly bad either because i know for certain i won't be hurting anyone by offing myself if i ever do it. i am rambling too much to the point where i probably come off as a petty and dramatic fuck but i just wish i could be happy. i haven't felt any euphoria for a long time. maybe i never will and i will keep chasing after happiness pathetically and desperately in an attempt to feel any sense of normalcy. i sometimes wish i could go back in time and kill my child self before he gained any consciousness. or my teenage self while he was still somewhat happy with his life so i could at least end my life on while i was happy. i just don't know what's wrong with me. i'll sleep for now and wonder the same things i did tomorrow morning again. just fuck me.",1713298304.0,

Normal-Bet-7426,I'm done,1,1c5xut2,4,"might get kicked out of the house soon. I'm 19 and I don't know what to do. I plan on killing myself if it does happen. 

I live in a toxic asian household. My parents see my life as throwable waste. They have always threatened to kick me out. Even for the smallest reasons. Even after everything I've done for them. Currently I'm at my lowest in life. I don't know what to do for university and the constant pressure is significantly impacting my mental health. Their reminders only make it worse. In terms of chores I do my chores. I wash their dishes and cook rice, but they say that's a given. They nag me when they have to tell me to do a chore telling me that I'm a robot that has to be told what to do. Sometimes I do them by myself, but other times I don't bother. My mother is a housewife. She has no job. She used to, but she was bad at being a caretaker so she quit. She is lazy at times. She only cooks food when my dad is here. When my dad has the night shift, she doesn't cook dinner at all. And expects me to cook for me and my little brother. I get it I'm old. I can cook.
But today was different. While I was cooking my early dinner, she said make sure to cook some for your brother. The dishes weren't washed the whole day and the only thing she cooked was not something my brother would eat. But that was too late, I go to the gym and currently I'm bulking. I eat alot. I said why didn't you cook for him? She snapped at me saying I can't ask you to cook? I complained saying that you should've told me you weren't going to cook so I would've prepared food for him too. She began hitting me with a cutting board saying it's a lot you can't share that? In the end I ended up sharing, but that wasn't the reason I was mad. The food I cook is quick and nearly bland. To compensate I gave my brother some mang thomas. He didn't finish his food. It was bland. And there was no other way to fix it because It was already fully cooked. She says she'll talk to my dad about this. And I'm pretty sure I'm getting kicked out given his mindset. I've always been hit, this is pretty common in asians households.  

My dad has always been petty and had a fanatical way of looking at things. Sometimes overcomplicates things and makes me look like the bad guy. Somehow it's always me.  I've been depressed for years, and I always thought this was normal. Until I looked at the symptoms of depression and I fit. For years I've been like this. 

And I'm done. I miss the times when I was happy. I miss the philippines. And if I do kill my self. I'm thankful for all the good things that ever happened to me.

I have tons of online friends i talk to every day and play games or do whatever.

I hate my life. I'm in college right now and haven't left my apartment in a month. I have extreme social anxiety. I know my dad sees me as a failure, he wishes that i could've been more like my friends who are all extremely outgoing and successful. I'm absolutely terrified of what my dad is going to do when i tell him i've done absolutely nothing this semester. He beat me and kicked me out of the house when i forgot to do a history assignment in high school and it stuck with me ever since.

About 10 months later we moved from Ohio to Tennessee I stayed their for two years then came back to live with my grandparents and my dad like we did before. all throughout this time I changed schools after every grade so I never made any friends really. skip to when im 11 we move in with his new girlfriend and kids to which I'm still living here 5 years later. I started school at this new school let's call it knight when I was in the eighth grade I would see this person in the hallway and I remember thinking they were the most beautiful person to ever exist lets call them zero. skip to a few months later she starts to talk to me and we go on a date where she kissed me for the first time. after that we began dating amd it lasted for a year and a half. we were best friends, we would always see eachother every other day, call every night; she was the person ive been the closest to. we lost our virginity to eachother a couple months into our relationship and I feel like that brought us closer. we had a few arguments only because she loved me so much and never wanted me to like anyone else which I didn't. skip to october I start becoming friends again with a friend I use to have let's call her zoe. zoe had kissed me once 5 months before this and I never told zero so when zero found out they were hurt and I felt so bad I didn't tell them. eventually zero breaks up with me and the next day I hungout w zoe and we made out then the next day zero came over wanting to get back with me even after seeing the hickeys. I can't believe I ever did that to her. she wanted me back for weeks but I was scared to get back in it. she started liking a friend of mine and I tried so hard to get back with her and make things work because even though i didn't stuff with zoe after we broke up I always wanted to be with zero. zero never got back with me and she started dating my friend and told me she had sex with him I know I shouldn't care but I do it breaks my heart. I tried to fix things with zero so many times because we were the closest people and I still love her so much. her and ny friend eventually broke up after 5 months and we started texting again we even planned on hanging out in the same little town we had our first date om. then she ditched me to go with her friends. I know ive hurt her but I've tried every second to make up for my mistakes and be there for her, but she's never even apologized or cares that she hurt me by telling people close things I only shared with her or her telling people about sexual things we would do that people now randomly go up and ask me which makes me so uncomfortable. we're back to not talking again, one night I took a bunch of pills and told her I loved her goodbye, sadly it didn't work so the next morning she tells me that me telling her I loved her made her uncomfortable and she doesnt wanna talk to me anymore.I care about her more than anyone could imagine she's my angel. it breaks me everyday that I didn't get back with her and fix things like we should've.

I’m 18 years old and I have a wonderful girlfriend, I have a great family. I have all the love in the world. And yet I still don’t want to be here. I’ve struggled with depression for quite a while. I had an attempt when I was 15/16 and I was in a hospital for about 2 weeks after that.

 At first, I was really glad I did it. Because after I lived I got to feel how much love I had around me that I just didn’t see before. I never could understand that people would notice if I was gone. And for a good amount of time I didn’t have those thoughts or impulses. I was happy to be alive and I didn’t think I’d ever feel like that again. It’s harder to explain how I’m feeling then before. 

Before I didn’t know people loved me and  was not in a good enough place to realize that. Now though, I know people love me and I know that they would help me if I asked for it. But now I don’t know if I want that help. I don’t want to be here anymore plain and simple I guess. I don’t really know how else to put it.

im friendless. im lonely. i literally have nobody. zero. phone empty. nobody to talk to at the end of the day. at this point ive accepted my fate. but it hurts so bad seeing all the girls my age having their own friend groups, living life, while i sit here rotting away in my bedroom trying to figure out where i went wrong. trust me, ive tried making friends, i really did, but for some reason, i guess because of my social anxiety, it never worked out for me. i just wish i had some female energy in my life. i want to have some friends that share the same interests as me. friends like sisters i can talk to at the end of the day about the problems in my life, but nope. it hurts so fucking bad. genuinely. i just wanted some friends. 

i was in a 3.5 year relationship with someone who ended up hurting me in the most horrific ways, that basically ruined me. i thought for once, someone in my life cared about me, and wanted me. but nope, that was quickly taken away from me too and was all a lie. 

my family is really toxic too. the love they give me is based on how well im performing in school, or money. otherwise i mean nothing to them and they couldnt give less of a fck about me. theyve made that pretty clear by now, as they constantly favour my brothers over me, and leave me out of everything. 

my health is in shambles. im chronically ill, suffering from a disease, and a whole array of mental issues. 

sorry for this post being all over the place. i cant do this anymore, genuinely. in my religion its forbidden to kys, but idc anymore at this point. gona do it soon.

Future_Interest5847,I’m going to kill myself soon,1,1c5v3xp,0,"Hello everyone, my name is TJ and you don’t know me but the things I’m about to say will change how you see me. For the last few months I’ve been struggling with a bad breakup of my long term ex. If that wasn’t enough I went down a deep depression where I’ve started failing in school and barely cleaning my room. But my friends were there for me. They had me going to church every Wednesday and I spent most of my time with them every week. But of course I begin to ruin it all. Around a week or two ago, my best friend ex had kissed me. And of course I developed feelings after that and I had asked for us to be romantically involved. She said no due to the fact I was her ex best friend and that she doesn’t want any drama. I of course kept asking for severs days for us to be a couple before giving up. We both agreed that this would never get out and left it at that.

And now what just recently happened 4 days ago. I was invited by my female friend (’ll call her B) to her female friend house (I’ll call her K) to spend the night. We had ended up getting super high and B had smacked my dick twice. While under the influence I had thought that, that means I could get touchy. So we had ended up watching a movie and I had begun to start touching her sexually. And she didn’t move me or seem uncomfortable at the time. But she was beginning to fall asleep. But I had tried to wake her up and she didn’t move at all. So I had stop touching her and moved to the opposite side of the couch. Every few seconds she would move subtly towards me and I had begun touching her again and she wouldn’t move at all. This repeated like 3 times. So I had whipped my dick out and had put it in her mouth. I had them ejaculated in her mouth. Around 3 minutes later she had woke up and went to the bathroom. Then she had texted K that she was feeling sick and needed tampons (also B was my ride) so a few minutes later my friend (we can call him R) had texted me and told me it’s time to go home. He had order me an Uber and that was that. I immediately woke up and realized the mistake I made and had texted B that I was deeply sorry and I don’t know what had came over me. She had said I had betrayed her trust and that I’m disgusting (which was true). I had later found out she had told my friends what had happened and they begun to text me and telling me they are no longer associated with me. I had texted B and offer to turn myself in at our local department. She had refused as she was already involved with the police on a separate matter.

What’s worse is that R had found out what went down with me and his Ex and now intended to fight me 

For the last few nights I’ve barely sleeper (longest was 3 hours) due to the fact I feel an immeasurable guilt and shame for what I’ve done. I’ve never looked at B that way and have never done that to anyone. In a few days I plan on killing myself by taking a bunch of pain killers and walking into the street. I know I’m a terrible human who doesn’t deserve to live. Under the influence or not. I should’ve asked for consent and never have done that.",1713311022.0,
Prior_Mammoth784,Really long vent/rant,1,1c5uzqe,1,"I have no idea what this is, I'm just ranting and yapping about random things here.
Feel free to read if you want..I just want to get this off my chest, if it helps.

I had an argument with my mom about not wanting to go back to school a couple days ago.

My father is currently depressed, due to guilt and stress. I feel that it's also because of me, I have trauma from him and this leads me to sometimes be irritated at the thought or sight of him, sometimes I feel guilty for it but I don't understand why I feel irritated all the time around him.

I yelled that I had to struggle and mask my depression for 4 years, and that I was exhausted of acting like I was fine. I think I've had depression longer than 10. (I'm 14 years old)

I have had 4 suicidal attempts, none led to the hospital, but my parents are aware of them.

I struggle at school, I can't focus, I've never been able to focus. I used to be called a gifted kid, now I can barely keep myself and my grades together. I'm in an advanced program in highschool, mostly to develop future scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and anything related.

I struggle with math, but I don't recall anything from childhood. It feels blank, like a missing piece I'm my memories. 
As I mentioned, I have trauma from my father. Teaching me math, he didn't hit me, but would yell at me. I struggle retaining basic facts, I still count with my fingers, I still haven't memorized my multiplication table, I struggle reading analog clocks. I have a memory from my father had once grabbed my chin and forced me to look at him. My older brother was hit when I was being taught at hid age which means ""I didn't have it worse"" I guess.


Sometimes my brain rewrites things. 
I remember telling my parents about my suicide attempt, leading to them taking me to the doctor, and then after a couple sessions...anti-depressants (Zoloft). 

I apparently only remember my mom stopped buying pills after I ran out. This is from my own memory.

But after an argument with my mom, she told me she asked me if I felt stable now and that I told her I felt fine and that I didn't need to be on medication anymore. After telling me, I suddenly remembered that what she said was true.

Another random thing I remember..
When me and my older brother get into arguments, it's always about how my tone or the way that I spoke felt disrespectful or mean or rude.
I don't understand why, I'm not even sure what I said wrong most of the time and after noticing this pattern, I try to be the calm one in situations. I don't understand why it doesn't work.


Back to the present.
I feel...disconnected from them (my family) but I feel guilty about all the things they have done for me. I feel like I have to repay them for simply providing for me.
They are...good people. It's not like they abused me and hit me..but I'm not actually sure what went wrong with me and why I'm like this.

I feel guilty that they had to have someone like me, I feel like I'm not even a real person anymore and that I'm a hollow shell of a person. I want nothing more than to kill myself and leave this world early.


The funny thing is, I have certain things I keep up with:

I love DC, I love the Batfamily the most and I feel an attachment to them.

(Although I don't have a huge collection of Comics I've read unfortunately, most of my knowledge about DC is through research and curiosity, I haven't really read through Comics  as I somehow can't focus on it.)

I've been like this for 2 years now though and I don't remember how it started.
My favorite character is Jason Todd.

Before DC though, was Marvel. 
To be specific, the MCU ( for the most part, I sometimes would dabble on the Comics).
My knowledge is to the extent of the MCU though, unlike DC, which is probably more detailed in my opinion. I plan on researching more about it...if I'm still alive by then.
My favorite character is Bucky Barnes.
I also like Spider-Man, but specifically, it's Spider-Man 2099, Miguel O'Hara.


As I've mentioned, I feel very attached to the mentioned...interests? To the point where I insert myself to the universe, in my imagination. I get so lost in these that I sometimes feel like I'd rather be imagining these instead of reality.
I don't particularly make mine have good origins, I sometimes take parts of my favorite character's origins and combine them to make mine.

(I'd write an example, but I've been typing for about 15 minutes now and I have no idea what I'm even doing.)

Because I lost that phone Im no longer able to access my ONLY email but because that phone number was disconnected there's no way for me to verify those accounts. Years of email and social media completely gone. Just in the past 6 months I've lost a brother to suicide, my apartment, my long term boyfriend, my cat, my car, my job. A lot of it was my fault and my addiction problems. But I've been clean and trying to solve my problems until today. I just cannot take it anymore. I can't deal with all of this loss. As stupid as it sounds that phone was the last thing I had. Without it and without my social media and email like I really think I'd rather just die. I've lost EVERYTHING and now You're telling me thats gone too? Ok hahaha I'm gonna hang myself tonight. Fuck everything and fuck you. ",1713308729.0,

I'm struggling with crippling depression since many years,I feel like there's no more hope for me and I get the hints from this as the days go on. In the past,I managed to recover my strenght but in the last four years I'm just digging my grave deeper and deeper. I have nobody to talk to,I have no more friends close to me,left my job and almost broke. I try to hide my pain,try to act normal but this behavior just drains my few energy out. I can't leave my house without feeling anxious or disperate,even though I may look ok. I rejected an eccellent job because I didn't feel worthy and capable enough,so that's making me experiencing a terrible regret. Everyday, especially in the morning and in the afternoon,I'm besieged by vivid thoughts of death and suicide as if it could be the only way things can go. I'm looking for a painless death, because I suffered for too long. Once I was stronger,persistent,happier. But now I'm just an automaton,I feel like I belong to the dead. And I'm neither free to leave this earth because if I do so it will be a shame to my parents and my surroundings. Many years ago I had a car crash in the deep of the night and I always think I've should be gone. Killing myself will only mean that I've acknowledged the failure I am. If things won't become better,I'll end this misery. It's just a matter of time,I don't think I'll make to my 30. I'm sick of this world,of this people,of these pointless wars,of these politicians and whatever evil mankind can produce. Sorry for this rant. ",1713285426.0,

Complex-Writing8102,Trying to work myself to death as a means of avoiding the guilt of suicide,5,1c5i5i2,2,"Hey folks - 41M here. I've done a lot of work on my mental health, but nothing seems to be working. Long story short - I have no overt trauma, but a lot of little things growing up coupled with being highly sensitive. I have CPTSD and always feel as though I'm never enough and the world is too much, too loud, too nasty, all the time. I just don't feel very much joy and wish I weren't here. I chronically feel as though I am a disappointment to others, particularly my parents, and there's no way for me to express to them that I \*know\* deep down how much I've let them down, no matter what I accomplish, for not being born as the child that they wanted.

At any rate, I never signed up for this life and I'm just so sick of this ride. The guilt of the trauma that I'd inflict on others around me has prevented me from killing myself thus far. But lately, I've been longing for like a terminal cancer diagnosis so that I have a way out that people will accept without guilt. I've also toyed with the notion of finding someway to slowly poison myself to induce a terminal illness while making it look like an accident. 

Most recently, I've been hoping that I could work myself to death. I'm stressed much of the time and push myself very hard physically. This has led to me developing high blood pressure. I'm fairly fit, but I've been wondering if I could find a way to push myself hard enough physically through bursts of extremely intense exercise so that I could induce a heart attack or stroke. If I could find a way to do that in an isolated environment, I could die that way by natural causes. The idea is that this would appease my guilt at hurting people by overtly, say, jumping off a bridge, while also dealing with the feeling that I'll never be enough by pushing myself so hard that I literally die. I have to say, the idea is deeply satisfying to me.

Curious if anyone else out there has had similar thoughts? Thanks for reading.

Broken-girl6,Tomorrow’s the day.,3,1c5kffy,1,"So I’ve suffered from mh since I was a baby being ripped out of my mother’s arms because I was abused and neglected by the guy in the home. I was in foster care then I had biological family adopt me due to court orders. They didn’t want me in the beginning, my mental health got really bad when I was 8 I developed an ed then started to sh at the age of 10. My family found out I sh at the age of 14. They told my mother and her and I got in an argument and she killed herself. Things got really bad when she did that and the bullying got much worst. I was getting r@ped and sa a lot. I got sa’d at school and the same guy told me the morning of my mother’s death to go kill myself. The school did nothing so I brought him to court but the vice principal provided the court with false evidence and the judge said she believed me because I have my facts straight and he didn’t but due to the false evidence he was pled not guilty. My family reversed my adoption and I was placed back into foster care at the age of 15 and I was sent over 3 hours away from home for a long time. A lot happened since but I’m not getting into that. My dad just died from cancer last month and he was more a dad to me than my biological dad was and I’ve never met my real dad.  Going through my dads death is really traumatic as I’m still not over my mothers death and I’m reliving all the same things again. I’ve had a few attempts in the past couple of months and my sh is getting really bad the doctors say they’ve never seen anything like it before. I’ve had this plan for a while now but this time it’s going to work it is bullet proof. In the eye of the government they are talking about allowing me to kill myself and they won’t do anything about it for personal reasons and it’s about dam time!  Today is my partners bday so I couldn’t do it today so I planned for tomorrow and I already have had my letters ready and everything I need for my attempt. I’ve already said goodbye to the people I actually like. I have my will done and also who will get my dog. If tomorrow I get stopped or I fail at attempting I’m not gonna stop till I succeed. I’m done with this cruel world. People are so nasty and rude no one can afford anything anymore, my family disowned me and I don’t have a good enough reason to stay. My partner is aware of my plan just not the date of it. I know this won’t happened but maybe the mh system will learn a bit from not helping as well as always hanging up the phone when I call the crisis line because they don’t want to talk or they have another call they have to take.

They're fine the majority of the time. Sometimes they're down right crule. But when I can't hear them I feel so alone. So I don't tell people about them. You tell someone your hearing voices in your head that don't belong to you and they get pretty freaked.

So yeah, I think I'm going to kil myself. Not today, probably not tomorrow but soon, I think. I feel like if screaming asking someone to notice that something is wrong.

On my own, I was working and seemingly doing fine, but the second I got home I went right into bed, on my phone or just nothing.

TheIcarusGirl,I could have prevented someone’s death. (?),2,1c5ldr0,2,"
TL;DR: In a small town, a misunderstanding over a dog with a neighbor led to guilt and sorrow, particularly when the neighbor took her own life. Reflecting on the situation, I question if things could have turned out differently.


(Home a).  In a small town in my area, there's a girl, who is my neighbor and is much younger than me but older than my sister. It's not really in my nature to talk to strangers, although in this small place it's the norm, but the cordiality and friendliness of saying good morning to those you don't know isn't always within my reach as I'm more introverted and reserved in my interactions. However, I do smile at people as I pass by them. This particular girl smiles back at me. I don't see her often since going out isn't something I do frequently, but she seems nice. Seeing her that day left me thinking about how young she is and the decisions she has ahead of her, decisions I wish I could change in my own life (the career I chose and the place I was going to live).

A couple of months pass, and the lack of space at home becomes more and more. This isn't good because we have pets. First (1), there's my dog, who has been with us since 2016. Its already been three years and she’s became an indoor dog. She got used to it because the place we lived in didn't have a yard, and because I loved her with all my heart (I wanted her to sleep on my bed). For a long time, I had begged to have a puppy, and finally, they got her for me. She arrived at the house one day out of the blue and she's still with us after 8 years. She's saved me from many dark moments with my own depression, she's been my companion all this time, through all those midnight moments that only those who have contemplated unsubscribing from life know. I keep telling to myself I can't die, I can't leave her alone. She'll never have an explanation on why I left, and she won't understand why her owner disappeared.
(2) Then there's my younger sister's dog. We got her later. She was small in age but not in size, maybe two years old when all this happened if my mind doesn't fail me. We got her through adoption. In our old house (we move a lot). In this place (home a) there was a black dog that we loved. We knew her life was on the streets, so we fed her when we saw her. We named her ""Sharpie,"" like the marker. She got pregnant, and our neighbors at the time, who owned the father, kept the puppies. Eventually, those same neighbors moved away and left their pets behind in that neighborhood. 

All 4 dogs (mom and puppies) became street dogs overnight, so we kept one. We named her Bambi. That dog loved my sister. We learned to love her with her antics and her playful and tireless personality. She always had energy, and most of all, she was always hungry. Eventually, she grew a lot, and our yard (home b) felt too small for her. My mother thought she'd be better off with other people, and we were trying to save money, and feeding her was starting to feel “burdensome”. So my mother convinced my sister that it was better to give her away, and my sister, without fully understanding, said yes, not knowing the pain she still feels today for having given her away. But it was something done in the name of giving the dog a better quality life. And who did she give Bambi to? To our neighbor with the smiles. (Who is also a very distant relative of ours).

A month after this happened, my sister's pain hurt me, and I talked to my mother about what she had done and that it was her responsibility to get the dog back since she had gotten us into this situation. She reluctantly spoke with the family of this girl, and it was agreed that the girl could visit us whenever she wanted to see Bambi. This plan went on for the next two weeks. The girl visited less and stopped smiling at me. I felt sorry for her, knowing she was resentful for getting so excited about having a new pet. I felt terrible for putting her in that situation, but I never told her, we never talked about anything really, and even less now that she hated me for the pain we had caused her. (I use the word hate because that's how it feels when you're a teenager, intense). I actually don't know if she wished me bad or not.

With my own depression, I wasn't doing well. In fact, I attempted to unsubscribe from life around those same months, but I can't remember if it was before or after Bambi... what I'm saying is that I didn't pay much attention to the girl's reaction back then, I thought she would get over it, eventually it would just be a bitter memory.

My family moved again. This place we were in was too small to continue my sister's studies (I had already dropped out of university for not being able to meet my academic grades).. this time when we moved, we decided to leave Bambi with family closer to us (in blood proximity, not in distance between houses), with whom we had a closer relationship, and my sister would be happy to know that our dog was well taken care of. Months after leaving Bambi with our family, we were informed of an offer someone made for her. After all, she was a very beautiful dog, white with brown spots. My mom accepted the offer mainly to remove the burden of caring for an extra pet from our family, for which we weren't providing maintenance. So Bambi went with people I have never seen, nor has my sister, and she is in a place we don't know. We haven't heard from her for years, and my sister is devastated nonetheless. 

And… the girl with the smiles? She committed suicide two years ago.
She died roughly 2 years after we asked her to return Bambi to us, and all this time I've wondered... if it was all in vain. Perhaps she could have kept Bambi, maybe she would have had someone to accompany her just like I have. Perhaps she wouldn't have died if I hadn't spoken to my mother about the dog. I know she left a note when she died, but I don't know what it said as that remained between her close family. And if she happened to mention Bambi in it, I don't think they would tell me anyway, so I wouldn't believe them if they said it wasn't my fault. I feel her death on my conscience.",1713287183.0,

So my mental health is very mess right now and my life. 

It all started with small insecurites of me being chubby and all. 

It all developed from being bullied from grade 3-6. My class wasn't the best since they bullied me and my 2 friends, first we were loners and it developes from there to being ganged up by the whole class... Of course the teachers knew about their behavior but no teacher did anything about it since they were a whole class bullying us.
And im asian, so many pulled their eyes at me in school, called me ching chong and other things. And all these things made my insecurities grow. 

And I started to do a diet to go down in weight, I did one meal a day + snack. (Still do) since I find it the easiest diet for me. 

And what happend that turned my life was that my best friend got a ed. 

This is where it was small and it wasn't that bad, of course I had to deal with my insecurities but my friend was as important for me as my life. So I wanted to be her ""Therapist friend"" since she didn't have anyone to talk to that knew. And we started venting to eachother. 

Also in 6th grade I started developing ""Sleep procrastination."" (Sorry for the bad spelling.)

Wich gave me plenty sleepless nights and huge headaches, and when you counted the bullying I avoided going to school since I was tired and scared even though my friends were with me. 

And this all continued until my insecurities grew so big I couldn't even look at myself anymore without nearly throwing up, I unfortunally developed social anxiety/anxiety by these things also. 

My grades dropped and I grew to hate myself so much I couldn't stand myself anymore. And I felt helpess to my friend, I couldn't help her any way. I could just watch her struggle and when she would ask me to help her throw away food, I helped her. 

I couldn't stand myself anymore after helping her even until today. She eventually got put in the hospital since her stomach closed up. And it all combined made me deppressed.

It was all a mess and I wish I didn't help my friend, the only way I can describe it is that I wanted to help ""her mentally"" but I couldn't also help her ""physically"" at the same time...

And I feel like a f@cking piece of shit. 

It all sounds so ""lightly"" like I know I don't deserve to think that I can be depressed and want to kms, but I just can't stand this all. 

I still have some things in life I still enjoy besides family and friends. And it crushes me and drives me insane to know that I'm 50/50 on doing it. 

And recently in school we had a health checkup that we needed to answer a few questions on a paper, and this all used to be private but without thinking I answerd honestly, and the school nurse will be talking to us personally about our answerd questions. And now im totally scared she will bust me and call my parents.

And of course the school days destroy me with stress since im in highschool now. 

Sorry for venting here. But I have no one to turn to now.

I got intrusive thoughts about hurting other people and myself.(by hurting i also mean killing) I just stayed home because i thought myself as a danser to the world so the only thing i did was watch horror movies,game and watch porn. 2 months after that i tried to go to school again and it was alright.

my mom can't do anything, my stepdad loathes me. i can't afford healthcare. i have so many health issues. i can't find a job. i'm too depressed. i'm tired of trying. i can't do this anymore. i can't even kill myself because i tried many attempts and everything failed. what do i do? buy SN, but even I'm too chicken to enter the dark web. not to mention how i can't afford it.

my ex is the only one who cares about me and he doesn't care if i block him or not. he broke up with me. i can't see a reason to keep going. 

for anyone saying it's gonna be better or you're gonna be okay, that's a lie. there's nothing fulfilling about living in poverty and sickness. im here complaining about my sadness, though, who cares anymore. why should a stranger care. it's funny, no one will really remember me. the ones who do, are just the ones who benefited from my company. i'm replaceable.",1713269881.0,

I’m now estranged with my only sibling, an older brother, was never a close relationship either, we were spilt up when my parents divorced.

I’m estranged from my son, and his 3 young boys. My son is a narcissistic selfish person. I do have a lovely daughter, only good thing in my life. But it is no longer enough to keep me going anymore, she has her own life and no children. I suffer from may ailments both physically and mentally. In constant pain. I suffer from severe anxiety disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, PSTD, severe agoraphobia, never leave the house. Phobias etc… you name it. My husband treats me like crap, constantly like walking on eggshells with him, so unhappy and miserable marriage. I hate when he is home. Lost both my dogs a few years back, miss them so much, kept me going. Now hubby won’t let me get another pet, even a cat, he says no. I’m stuck at home, sick all the time, with no life.

Terrible_Battle7916,I want to kill myself but I don't have the balls to do it,8,1c5b2b9,0,"Hi. Im 27 yo male, and ive been thinking about suicide every day since i was a child. This is the quite boring and cringe story of my life. 

I was born in a middle class family with both parents i had a decent education although my dad was a raging alcoholic. I was constipated and I shit myself everyday until like 5 years old because i couldnt control it. This led to trauma because I was constantly mocked by other children and sometimes beaten by the female kindergarten teachers when they found out. I tried to hide this issue as much as possible from my parents. Over time I became a very turbulent child because i wanted to attract attention,  so constantly being the clown or being fired changing schools etc.. Then something weird happened, I don't know how but I got over sexualized, maybe I was abused in my early childhood or maybe it was because of the school I was in which was very ""alternative"", but basically when i was 8 years old we started to ""play doctor"" with a girl the same age, and eventually we had sex, multiple times. We knew it was wrong and we hid from people. But after a while she wanted to stop, and I didn't. I was half ass raping her at times and being very insistant. I tried to erase all of this from my memory but as I grew up I realized how uncommon/fucked up this is (even on the internet people in this situation are few and far in between), I still feel very guilty and weirded out about this to this day.

Middle school was the worse, no friends, was bullied, but sometimes i was the bully too to feel accepted. I had very intrusive suicide thoughts already, and would often lie to my parents about being sick just out of depression and fear going to school.I was rejected in all the social groups I got into so you get the memo in your head that if you're rejected everywhere you are the problem. 

Then in high school it got better. made some friends, i was starting to be more confident, extravert etc, and even had a girlfriend for a few months. But when we broke up I was devastated, like way too much for what it was, i cried so much. I started very bad habits, smoking weed everyday, binge drinking every week, and even more procrastination. That's also when I started to realize the scope of my mental health issues, i always knew i was fucked up but started to make sense of it. Very anxious, obsessed with what other people think, ashamed of myself, low self esteem, talking to myself all the time, depersonalisation, mood changes, perfectionnism, lying and deceiving friends for no reason etc... but one more than others, I have a sort of truman show syndrome and extreme procrastination stuff mixed in with OCD which I will try to explain.

Again this is not diagnosed but i will say to myself ""I start to turn my life around on April 17th at midnight"" So I will do a sort of ritual, make sure there is no imperfect things around me like I will for example subscribe to 1000 YouTube channel before so its a perfect number. If I have money I can spend it so it falls exactly at 1000 euros left. I will clean my apartment to an extreme maniac level to make sure I'm fully prepared for midnight, things like that. Once it starts, i think people watch me and my life and so I try to act perfect, saying perfect things (talking to myself so they can hear me) and make sure i am 100% perfect and not say anything cringe/make mistake or be uncomfortable around people. The problem is, it always end up happening a day or another. So then usually after a few days I give up, have an existential crisis, and prepare for another one a week later or so, ""this time it will work"". While I'm not after a midnight try, I will do nothing at all, dont clean, dont try, avoid people and so on, since it will all magically fix the next week when this time it will be real. This led to having different personalities and people kinda notice.

Been doing that for ten years, hundreds of times, week after week, and year after year, went so fast, but a lot happened since. After high school I dropped out of college , twice. I gradually pushed myself away from my friends, becauae I was always getting way too drunk at parties which led to me crying or get angry. As I felt very guilty every time i still did it again and again and again to the point it eventually ruined my life and that of other people. At 19 I grabbed a woman ass at a party, no one knew, I apologised, but I get guilty ever since. Then at 21, I got arrested driving drunk and high while speeding. I also insulted cops (can't remember much) so yeah I avoided jail by a thread but had my license revoked and a criminal record. Later on I purposefully spent my 10k inheritance from my grandparents into booze, weed and giving it away to charity in like 5 months, because I thought I didn't deserve it. My mom was mad, but I went back to her place for a while. There I really isolated entirely from all my remaining friends and became a full NEET, not working, I spent my entire days smoking weed and on the internet , which had a toll of its own on my mental health lol.

I got into some pretty bad rabbitholes and incel stuff. I was very sexually frustrated, in a weird position since I was both not virgin since 8 but also never fucked ever since. Also I have incest porn addiction. Even the few times I was approached by women right after high school, I rejected the opportunity out of lack of confidence. I never hated women, I know Incel stuff is bullshit, but I have those constant intrusive thoughts and despair regarding women. This got the point I entirely avoid talking to any of them in fear that they realize my incel thoughts or think I'm weird. So as I isolated myself over time I also got into a bad sunken cost mentality, that since I was already 23 year old and a total loser, that would define me forever. The more time passes the more you think this is too late.

In spite of all this, there is one (weird) thing im obsessed with since I'm a child, it is a deep fascination for the usa. This has kept me going over time. I spent days, months, looking at google maps, learning about the country, watching american medias and TV shows etc... and it basically hit a couple years ago, that since I don't have the balls to kill myself anyway, I should try to turn my life around and emigrate there. A high school friend of mine who didn't give up on me also helped pull me out of this spiral.

Since then I have been doing retail amd restaurant jobs, started making new friends around. Although I know I'm very immature and strange, but I try to force myself to appear confident and appear funny etc... despite my very low self esteem. So after a while I even managed to get a girlfriend, and so I finally break that 16 year drought lol, and it started good, I felt so happy like never before, I tried to do my best for her etc... but several things made it complicated. I wasnt really attracted to her tbh, I just wanted to try something and I realized it is extremely selfish. Also, we werent that compatible as she was much older and I felt like an immature teen next to het friends in their 30s, all working 5k tech jobs and me being a waiter, felt out of place. Anyways, we were both with our own confidence issues and relationship slowly faded and we eventually broke up in good terms. One other thing is that I suck at sex. I have both erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation, which means 2 minutes of nothing for me and the other person. That is odd since I never had that issue by myself when I masturbate. So some time after we broke up I went to sex workers, I wanted to just have more confidence and try to have normal sex but both times didn't get hard. And yet both my girlfriend and the sex workers told me I have a big dick, but i just have too low confidence and too much depression I think. I realize all this may have to do with the fucked up things I did in my childhood, but the issue is its a spiral, im depressed because I feel lonely and can't do anything because im depressed. Just like I smoke pot because im depressed and the more I smoke the more worthless I feel.

Anyways after that I moved to another city and now im trying to get my life back together, but I struggle. Switching jobs, no friends here, just a shitty weird life. The only reason im still alive is I don't want to hurt my mom by killing myself. And I can still watch the American idiocracy shitshow unfold from the other side of the altantic. Most of the time I just really wish I was born in a perfect middle class suburban american family with no mental issues. But I know that it's a dream and I probably would have the same personal issues even there (and also im still grateful to be born here and not third world but again i feel guilty about that) And im not sure America needs another degenerate pothead. 

Recently this took a different turn. I got into religion and realized the LDS church is the best option. It's an american made religion, they frown upon addictions like alcohol and tobacco and they have a sense of love and community which I desperately need. They also emphasise traditional gender roles and protect children from sex influences which given my peculiar experience is very important to me. The issue however is that I don't believe a single word of the Bible nor the book of mormon. It's all made up but I realise everything is, so I may soon convert, the only thing is I'm worried for now is how my mom would react since she's very anti religion. 

I also went to see a therapist for a while but I was paying 80 euros an hour to hear things I already knew. It would have taken years if not an entire life lol and im broke af anyways. I tried to apply some of it though step by step, to break the procrastination cycle and forgive myself. But how do i forgive myself after all the shit ive done? All the violent, cringe and sad stuff that makes most of my life? I've hurt people and ive hurt myself, it seems i cant let go of the past and unconsciously self punish myself into oblivion because I think I deserve to die. She also told me I might be on the autistic spectrum but I never got diagnosed and when I looked it up, a lot of symptoms don't match. I know I have some severe mental issues though, sometimes I think my place is more in an asylum than out here lol.

So yeah I'm at this point I'm lost, I am.constantly bored and depressed, can't even enjoy anything or laugh, I try to pull myself out at least working jobs, but I usually quit after 6 months. I hesitate between killing myself or go all in and change my life and try to emigrate to the promised land, but for that I would first need to 1)Hire a lawyer to get rid of my criminal record 2)Get back to college 3)Manage to get a work visa or a green card lottery, which in itself is hard enough to get. Anyways, ill try on the 17th and well see where it goes. Probably going to want to violently kill myself on the 18th and drink myself to sleep because I said cringe things while talking to myself which people in my head mocked me for. Yeah...

Extension_Pirate_874,Rant about my experiences :) ,4,1c5f87a,3,"When I was 12, a week before my birthday, I had overdosed on 52 Panadol and 34 ibuprofen, that obviously landed me in the hospital after I realised what I had done, I still remember going to my mother and telling her through tears what I did while she yelled at me, she kept demanding to know why and I just couldn’t tell her because in all honesty, I don’t know why. 

That was the worst time of my life lol, they could never get the iv drip in my arm so it would always end up in my hand, it’d burn sometimes and I wouldn’t say anything because I thought I deserved it. On the way to the hospital my parents were also pulled over by the police which was insane because their 12 y/o child in the back seat’s liver could of gone into failure at any point. Luckily for me they ended up guiding our car to the hospital with their lights turned on. 

I understand why my parents were so panicked and I understand why they yelled now but at the time I just was wishing for a hug, for my mother to tell me everything would be all right, you know? My parents were very different people when raising my two half sisters, they were fucked up on drugs yk all that shabang. My dad was prone to anger outbursts and I never experienced that growing up until that night, it was genuinely terrifying. Anyways,

A year later at 13 years old I did the same thing except with my antidepressants, my sister had told me to do it and I guess out of a moment of spite I did? I didn’t plan on surviving that time, although by the time my dad got home I had thrown up majority of the tablets and was just planning on cleaning it up and going about my day like normal, I ended up just sitting there on my bedroom floor with a disgusting amount of puke surrounding me.
Again, I ended up at the hospital. I was told by the doctor that if I hadn’t thrown that up my heart would’ve likely stopped. 

That night my mother was crying on my hospital bed, holding my hand. She again kept asking me why and I felt so pathetic when she begged me to just talk to her but nothing would come out. She didn’t ask me to promise her not to do it again, I just did, because that was my mum crying over me like I was dead. My family mourning back at home as if i was gone. It was heartbreaking.

Sometimes i still have thoughts of suicide, I still struggle with things such as self harm, and I really do just pray that one night I’ll go to bed and not wake up. I wish that would happen so deeply but then i remember the look on my big sister’s face when she came to visit me in the hospital and that hurts so bad.

Suicide looks like an easy way out but I could never do that to my parents, to my sisters. To my nephew, to my grandparents. In such a big family i’m not seen or often heard but I know how much I mean to most of them now lol.
Suicide is painful and trust me, no one deserves to die. And i hope you, whoever read my rant or whoever needs this, will realize that. You are loved, people cherish you, life is like a hike, you’re just at an extra rocky place but you can push through💗",1713271605.0,

Sorry if my English is bad.
I never told anyone how I feel or anything. I lost many closed ones like my dad died or someone close leaving me.i had horrible school life and even in college I had worst. No one is really there for me except mom and my little brother  but I never tell her anything cause she is already going through a lot. I was managing myself that I could go through this. But now everything is overwhelming for me I can't think and I feel so weak and can't do anything. 

I hear voices or idk what that is but it keeps telling me that I should die or sometimes even hurt someone but still I always try the best to hide everything from others. Due to this I can't sleep so I wear headphones all the time still it doesn't work.. But recently the voice or the thought of dying now is getting so much intense that I can't keep up my smile.
Now I got a job and it's like far from my mother and I have very high fear that I will lose her too.i don't want to go there and leave her and my brother alone they were dependent on me for everything. 

I can't I don't know what to do everything is so bad now even I feel better to leave this world soon. I can't keep up with this.

Things were finally falling into the right place until one stupid module. we had a group assignment and normally for group assignments only one person has to submit it. I didn’t know for this one that everyone had to submit it, so I didn’t and neither did one of the other people in our group. And now i’ve got a 0 in that module. Our essay actually got 60%, but I got a 0 because I didn’t know everyone was supposed to submit it.

 Same module, I was supposed to do the test this morning before 12pm. I took a nap and set and alarm for 10am. My phone decides not to ring out, and it just so happens that I woke up at 12:20, 20 minutes after the due time. 

this is one of those compulsory modules where I have to get at least 40% in each assignment, but i’ve missed both of my last two. and with this completely simple act, i’ve fucked everything up. tomorrow is my birthday.

There is no talking me out of doing this, so don’t bother. i’m a little scared that i won’t be able to do it the way i have wanted and at the time i had planned, do to personal reasons. however it will get done no matter what. 

I’ve began to appreciate life more as my time has dwindled. i don’t appreciate living, but more the concept, how strange it is that i’m able to type this problem of mine with a way of communication from years of evolving onto a device that emits light from tiny pixels. how strange it is that we are this insignificant in the universe yet everything means everything to us. how strange the world is, a big rock that coincidentally has all the necessities for a civilized society to form, a civilization too smart for their own good. 

i guess what i’m getting at is, i am beginning to miss living though i am alive. i wont be able to miss living if im dead so i am right now. at first i thought maybe i was having second thoughts but i was wrong. i’ve put much thought into this, more than i think anything else in my life. i spent my entire life thinking about the end rather than the present. 

if things could be different then i’d choose for things to be different rather than ending my life. but that’s just isn’t the case. it’s not that i don’t want to live so much as i just don’t want to be existent. i no longer want to feel, feel sad, feel guilty, feel tired or alone. i am sick of it. i don’t want to think anymore, i don’t want to think about all the cruel things that have happened to me, especially all the cruel things i have done. a man i met once said “Smart people tend to feel sadder because they think deeply. When you think a lot, you may find yourself dwelling on sadder things more often.”-unknown. i’m not saying i’m “smart”, i just think i am too aware and cognitive for my own good. 

i’ve been trying to do as much for my family as i can before i go. i’ve began a garden in the backyard that my mom always wanted, fixed the boat my dad wanted to take out to the lake, spoiled my younger siblings the best i could. among many other things. i know i will leave my family heartbroken, im not going to sit here and sound stupid by saying no one cares about me. i know people do. i feel guilty as i know i am going to hurt them. but i am truly burdening this family with my medical bills, legal troubles, and down and out personality. i’ve began to save up money to cover my funeral so im not leaving them with one more thing to worry about. i’m doing this for them.

there’s a lot more i could add, maybe if anyone wants to know more of my situation or just wants to talk, i am always open. 

i hope to whoever reads this that you are doing well. if you’re on this subreddit because you are thinking about ending it, please don’t. i know it’s very hypocritical of me to say. just do not, especially if you have the chance to change things around.

Adventurous-Gap8596,Should I check into the mental hospital,3,1c5goxo,1,"A few warnings: suicide, eating disorders, and depression are mentioned

So I’m currently at my second semester at my university as a first year student. My grades have always been fine and even to what I would consider excellent up until two weeks ago. Since January, my mental health has declined significantly. I’ve been to the hospital for OD on alcohol in an attempt to kill myself and was placed in the psych ward for five days. I have a history of major chronic depression, and for some reason this last semester has been extremely difficult to navigate due to my mental health. I’ve lost almost 40 pounds since January and have restricted my eating for almost 8 months now. I’ve also had a history with bulimia and received a diagnosis for ednos when I was in middle school. Anyway, I’m sure you get the point that I’m really sick. I’ve been to the on campus resources for help but at this point I don’t know if I can continue the semester. I’d rather fail each class and start my journey to healing. However, I am also currently on the GI bill and I’m worried that if I fail all my classes it might put financial strain on my shoulders with debt. (I might have to pay it back) The problem is I am so sick at the moment deep into anorexia and depression that I’ve considered the idea that I may need to go back to the psych ward and stay for a longer period of time because I haven’t eaten in four days and I’m seriously considering suicide again while also struggling to live day to day as I constantly feel dizzy as if I’m going to pass out any day now. I’m on two medications and I’ve take five times the prescribed amount dosage for my antidepressant honestly wondering if it will kill me someday. Ultimately, I just wanna be okay. I think I should go back into psychiatric care and get help for my eating disorder and suicidal thoughts. I’m just very concerned about my coursework it’s the end of the semester but I genuinely don’t think I can continue. I am completely fine with failing my classes, but what should I do so I don’t put more financial strain on myself? Does anyone know about GI rules and exceptions?

Training-Bed-9546,My wife doesn't know if she loves me and I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts,1,1c5ldrf,0,"To be clear, it's not her fault.  It's mine.  I've been a horrible husband.  Just not very helpful.  She takes on so much for our family.  She does so much for our kids. She's lost weight because of the stress and the labor. I've been trying hard to make things up to her.  Helping out more.  Making sure the house is clean.  Making sure she has as little to do as possible before she gets home, but this surge of thoughtfulness is only about two weeks old.  I doubt she trusts it will last.  I've been unhelpful off and on for almost five years now.  I don't know why I'm just waking up to all of this now.

But it makes me think that maybe it's all too little, too late. She won't touch me in any affectionate way.  She doesn't feel any sexual feelings toward me.  And who could blame her?  I'm 39 and although I'm not completely out of shape, I am declining.  I'm turning forty.  I'm becoming just generally unattractive and it's only going to get worse as I get older.  And I can't stop thinking about how much it sucks to get older.  The slow decline that apparently started in my 30s is only getting worse at 39.  I feel like a useless middle aged man that's only going to end up dragging everyone down.  It feels inevitable that eventually my wife is going to get her groove back and it's not going to be with me.  And though it upsets me, I can't blame her.  What have I done to deserve her love and affection?

So I can't help but think that things would be better if I were out of the way.  I don't want to leave and watch my kids being raised by someone way better than me in everyway.  I can't stand by and watch my wife fall in love with someone else while I decline and age, becoming more and more pathetic.

If we were to divorce I'd have nothing.  I have no adult friends.  My brother and I used to talk but he's pissed off at me and refuses to speak to me.  I have no one and nothing else.  I just keep thinking, things would be better for her without me there.

I told her I was having these thoughts about killing myself during a text rant.  I was upset that she won't touch me in anyway.  I accused her of not loving me.  That's when she told me that she doesn't know if she loves me.  She's never addressed that I mentioned my struggles with thoughts about killing myself.  It makes me wonder if she, deep down, hopes that I'll do it.  Release her from her fuck up of a husband.

I've had these thoughts off and on for awhile but this is day 3 of me trying to stop vaping and these thoughts have been pretty persistent today.  I'm at work but I went into an empty meeting room so I could just be upset for a few minutes.  I guess I just realized that I love my wife, and I'm in love with her and she doesn't feel the same way at all.  And that is all my fault.  I just have no idea if trying to take on more responsibility and help around the house more is going to convince her that I'm trying to change. Or if she even cares.

PlanetEarthIsWeird,Idk what to do anymore...,3,1c5d32y,0,"Edit: I get really bad intrusive thoughts... the main ones are throwing myself in front of a train/jumping off a bridge... if anyone has any suggestions to help ease that... I would greatly appreciate it 🙏🏻 

I drank with my friend Sunday night and did some cocaine. We hung out. And it was fine till things got super overwhelming being around people. Plus, I had to hide from this toxic girl she likes because had this girl seen me... it would have been super bad my friend said.

That made me feel like shit. And you'd think when we hung out she'd be more open to listening to my concerns... she was talking over me almost the entire time. And I have such a pet peeve about that. And it might also be trauma from family not listening to me growing up...etc.

Anyways... I left her house a little after 9 AM yesterday. I took a nice walk. I kept drinking after getting home. Listened to music in the afternoon. When the evening hit... everything hit me at once. Everything I've been going through and trying to shove down.

So I started bawling my eyes out. And I got the point where I just didn't care if my mom and her boyfriend saw/heard me. 

She saw me, asked me if I was OK (mind you I play the parent role with her usually) and I told her I was depressed. Then she was like ""oh the new bass you got isn't helping?"" (I'm a musician... and I did get a nice bass guitar recently to start playing after years of not playing) 

And that question felt very dismissive. Like of course music helps me. It's one of the only reasons I am still alive. But my bass can only do so much to help.

8:30 in the evening I decided I had enough being awake. So I took my night meds... only this time instead of 2mg klonopin and 50mg seroquel... I took 3mg of klonopin... then that turned into 4mg.

I know I have to try harder at being healthy. It's just so hard when I don't have a support system... and I'm traumatized by previous therapists.

I'm sorry for the vent... I just don't know what to do anymore. And I feel like God forbid something bad happens to me... basically no one will care. I'm sure most will be glad I'd be gone for good.

Salt-Tomorrow8686,Is it bad that I want my boyfriend to die?,2,1c5evtb,4,"Actually, you dont have to answer that, I know that the answer is yes.

Recently, things hasn't been going so well for him so he's been down lately. And he would say that he wants to kill himself. He was mostly joking because we would make kms jokes all the time (we're still edgy minors btw).

But right now he is feeling pretty down, and because of it only keeps tanking his performance. I know feeling down sometimes doesn't mean that you're about to full blown off yourself. But that doesn't mean you're 100% gonna not.

So, why do I want him dead? Well guess what I've been wanting to kill myself for years. I was planning on it previous year, even made a very slobby plan I didnt follow through with. And ever since I met him I gained myself a new reason to live. But I dont think its gonna be enough, I dont know if I can pull through just for him. And that's what I'm scared of, I dont want him to blame himself or feel any grief or guilt because of my death. 

So I think it would be best if he died first, then I can take my life after. Me suggesting we do a double suicide wouldn't work because he wants me to live (He explicitly said that). This is very, very selfish of me but I wish he would follow me after I die. But i would have no way of knowing that.

He could follow me, or he would have to suffer even more on this shitty planet, or perhaps he could live on and move on from it. But whatever the case is, I would still cause him immense pain. But if he were to go before me, he would have no way of knowing what happens next.

And all I want is for him to think and believe that I stay strong and live happily with my life, even if it's a lie. I already don't have much reasons to live, anyone to care or be cared for besides him. That sounds very corny but it's the truth that I made up for myself. 

I've already crafted up many notes, ways of telling him my goodbye, and I dont want to use any of it. Honestly, if a miracle ever happens and we both lived happily ever I'm gonna cringe alot at this post. But now, the future is very bright and I don't like it, it blinds my vision.

Now, whenever I think of suicide, I see and hear them. I hate them for it. Because now I can't die, and I miss them, even though I know it was just professional or whatever. Absolutely meaningless. 

Why do I even remember it then. I'll never see them again. I'll just get a restraining order. I bet they wouldn't even come to my funeral.

avocadoswag,I realized i have to be smarter about it,5,1c5awbh,1,"I have seriously wanted to die since i was maybe 15 or 16. I had thoughts before that, but that was the age I started trying. I've overdosed on my prescription meds a handful of times, I've been in inpatient, outpatient, seen multiple therapists, psychiatrists, taken the meds, done the work for about 10 years now. But every time something really bad happens (a loved one does, I have a breakup, I get cheated on, I lose a friend, I do poorly in school) I can't help but fantasize about ending it all. Every time I do something mean or embarrassing my instinct is I have to disappear and end it all. I just keep making the mistake of failing. I catch myself trying to jump off an overpass or run into traffic, I take pills and just end up in the ER or waking up the next morning feeling like shit. So I've started making plans for a more permanent end. My job right now is so stressful, I just went through a breakup and I have no friends in my city, and people keep telling me I can't just quit. So I'm going to just end my suffering. I'm buying a car soon. I'm going to drive it far enough away that no one can find me until it's too late, I'm going to take my anti anxiety meds, and I'm going to use an exit/suicide bag to inhale helium and deprive my brain of oxygen until I just pass out and die without realizing. It's so foolproof, there's no going back. If I'm not acting on impulse I'll surely be able to carry it out. I feel bad for whoever has to find me, maybe if anyone has any tips on how to alert authorities but not fast enough that they will be able to stop me that would be helpful.

nomishkaa,Like 16 years later,6,1c59pl5,1,"I went into an inpatient psych ward after tearing myself up pretty bad and i had already made a few attempts by this time. My mom had me looked at by a hospital, which I really wish she didn't, like I'd have rathered talk to someone else after the cuts healed and i couldve waited that long. I still get sentimental about that time i spent in there and its the only reason ill buy myself fig newtons cause i remember having them every day at meetings. 

At that time I had felt that way for years already. Like since I was 7. I was confused all the time and everything thing I did seemed to get me trouble or embarass myself. I'd go out with friends when I was supposed to be doing homework since I just really needed that and I didn't care that I'd get beat for it. Eh anyway, the grippy fun place told me I have bipolar, psychotic depression, and adhd (I don't think I have adhd though). I stopped taking the meds shortly after when I said I made all of it up to live with my dad in another state - I didn't, nor did I care to live with him, it was just - away. Ended up not being a horrible idea, I tend to forget a lot of the parts where my dad really changed the way I look at things now. But being around that much alcohol and drugs + other alcoholic/druggies every day wasn't exactly helpful. 

I still get the feelings, recently had a self harm incident worse than I ever did before, and have been having thoughts again. At kind of a weird point now since I've had these feelings for so long deciding if I just give it another go or just disappear somewhere.

 I feel like I know I'm going to try again because I'm too worried about what my family and people who have cared about me would say or think. And I kinda at least wanna leave a lengthy note or project of some sort behind. Mostly cause I don't trust some of these mfs and they'd act like they had no clue when I can't imagine how anyone could be that fucking dense at this point. 

Anyway, I see some of your guys' posts and replies, I'll see how things go and even posting here helps a little bit. But it's definitely getting harder and harder to keep going and I don't have insurance or anything to help afford therapy or anything. I wish I didn't feel like I was guilt tripped by other people that I wouldn't even have to worry about if I did quit. But I'm sure as hell not watching myself die slowly either, so I guess I better make this attempt count cause I'm running out of fuel to keep getting back up and i know eventually these things holding me back won't be there. Theres some things i like about living but mostly a lot of stuff i feel like is corrupt, horrible, unlucky, and just kinda fucked up sometimes. Hopefully you guys that are considering something tonight try to keep finding a reason to give life a little extra try. For me, it's been rough but most of the time I've kept going after it got really bad I had some really big life changing things that i really enjoyed after that I wouldn't have otherwise....also wouldn't have messed them up either but....I'd imagine it's possible to not mess up friendships and stuff too. Anyway, it's not very motivational but hope you guys make it another night and try to look for something to go another extra push. I'm running out of steam to keep doing it too but I'm also apparently too weak to commit either..but it also reminds me how I was too weak to commit to leaving my family when I was a kid until I was 14 until I eventually did too.",1713250823.0,

Newguydonthurtme,This is the worst year of my life,2,1c5di4u,0,"To start off the year, my grandmother, the last person I really had a connection with in my family, died a few days after I visited her in America. The rest of my America trip I ended up stuck in another state with someone who I no longer got along with and couldn’t even go to her funeral. 

While there I got in an argument with my spouse over the phone in which they said I wasn’t in touch enough while visiting home and blamed me for  some problems their mom was causing. I was incredibly apologetic but maintained my boundaries. They said some really hurtful things on top of everything.

I finally got home and was so happy to see my partner again, only to immediately be told in the car at the airport that they apparently cheated on me with a loved one while I was gone, only a couple days after I left. The whole time they were calling and texting and stressing me they had already been cheating on me.

They blamed it all on me. Said my disability made me a burden. Said I’m too depressed. Said I don’t put out enough.

I tried to still make things work but after a while it was obvious they were still sneaking behind my back. We finally broke up and I said I want a divorce. Best part of that conversation was when I asked them if I gave them another chance would they even be able to stop cheating and they said “that’s like if I asked you to stop cutting yourself” 🙃

A few days later we got a package from their mom. It was hate mail directed to me. Included notes calling me a slut, saying I have stds, saying I’m gonna ruin their life and I’m a bad spouse. It also included an art print of Medusa that was meant to be me. She was and still is unaware we separated.

Through all this I found out I might have cancer. A large lump in my chest that keeps growing. I was going to monthly appointments with no straight answers. Finally got a sort of answer yesterday. They don’t know what it is, but they want to surgically remove it to stop the growth especially since there’s now two of them. This means I will have to stay in another country with my ex spouse for even longer while filing for divorce.

I have next to no money, they now want me to finish paying off everything they bought me after I move out.

I told my abusive mother after 3 months separated because I needed help and don’t have anyone anymore. Now she’s calling me almost every 12 hours day or night and freaking out if I don’t immediately answer. She’s demanding I come home to her right now even tho I need my surgery etc. 

She’s also making me incredibly paranoid. Saying my ex is plotting against me, probably wants to murder me, wants to detain me against my will, is gonna start hitting me, and that they’re trying to throw their credit debt on me through the divorce.

I’m in hell. Idk what else to say. I can’t do this anymore.",1713266158.0,

But I feel so alone and I don’t want to be here at all. The guilt from wanting to die is insane. It’s like a stabbing feeling in my chest of wanting to die so bad but being unable to do anything about it. I pray to God that He kills me. I feel bad about it, asking Him to do that. I am not even religious but it feels like a last resort I guess. 

I am scared of the pain of dying. I am scared of how bad it will hurt my mom and my best friend. I feel completely stuck. I am in therapy. I’m on medications.

inspektorkemp,Spiralling Forever,18,1c50pwt,4,"I feel like I know too much. 

The economy is crumbling and capitalism is devouring itself. I got fired from my shitty capitalist job in my shitty capitalist city because I couldn't keep my mouth shut about how terribly I was being treated. In between scrambling to find a replacement job and the unchecked terror of potentially being forced back into retail, I'm grappling with my PTSD in ways I never have before. My life has been a constant cycle of naive innocence and bubbly confidence, and crash-and-burn arcs where I feel like everything falls apart around me and nothing I do matters. I was hit by my father as a child at the age of four or five. Once. Once was all it took. One strike on the backside at so tender and fragile an age was all it took to destroy something crucial inside me forever. I live in constant terror of authority figures. I walk on eggshells around everyone I interact with, to appease them and not provoke their ire - yet the other side of me wants to stand up for herself, to bite back when bitten, to lash out when struck. She isn't going to let anyone hurt her again. But unfortunately, being an adult in this awful, awful world means letting lots of people hurt you, spit on you, throw you under the bus, and to smile and take it like a good little servant. I see the snideness, the condescending attitudes of those above me, those who wouldn't piss on me if I were on fire, those who think giving employees pizza parties and snack food makes up for their terrible management and unfair labor divisions. 

When I detect disrespect, I become crippled and paralyzed. I cannot decide if I need to scream at them or start crying and apologize. Neither are socially acceptable. Even a professional apology does nothing, because one social infraction at work is all it takes to get the ball rolling. They've singled you out. They know you're too smart to buy their bullshit, and that makes you a threat. 

Adulthood is an endless parade of convincing people far more powerful than you'll ever be that they don't have to be afraid of you. As if you could ever lay a finger on them whatsoever. 

Adulthood is kissing ass to people who would happily put a knife in your throat if you annoy them too much. 

I can't deal with it anymore. 

I never wanted to be an adult. I never wanted to exist in the first place. Being born was a violation of my consent. I wish I were never brought screaming from the unconscious void into a bright, loud, confusing world where everyone is mad at me and yelling at me and telling me how to dress, how to walk, how to talk, how to feel, how to exist. My life has never been my own. I suppose no one's is, but that just makes me angrier. I want to kill myself. I want to kill myself just to spite these stupid fucking assholes who couldn't see how much I was hurting, who couldn't stop my basketcase of a father from hurting me, who wouldn't stop the bullies at school who could smell how weak and pathetic I was. I want to hack my veins open and bleed out all over their porcelain, perfect world, to drag them all through the mud so they finally understand that the fantasy land they defend is one that took a sweet, innocent, beautiful little girl who just wanted to love and be loved and broke her down into a maddened mess of sadness, isolation, and hatred. 

I used to be bright and sweet. I am now dim and bitter. I am angry. I am hateful. I am a screaming infant with a chainsaw, torn between hacking apart the fabric of reality that lies before me, and turning it on myself so that I can shut my eyes and feel the pain finally go away. 

Pathological demand avoidance. ADHD. 'Highly sensitive person.' Autism. Oppositional defiance. Rejection sensitive dysphoria. CPTSD. They're all insufficient terms conjured up by a system that rewards moneymaking instead of helping people heal. 

I have attempted twice in my life. I know damn well how useless emergency services are. How they and the friends that call them smile to your face and tell you everything is going to be okay, but secretly want to hit you and scream at you and ask what the fuck is wrong with you, stop being a freak and get back in line with everyone else. Nobody else complains like you, so maybe you're the problem. Nobody else runs away from home intending to cut themselves open and bleed out in a ditch on the side of the road on a cold October night, feeling so utterly alone and rejected and hated because your stupid fucking 'therapist' can't help you because your anxieties are bigger than ""I'm stressed about school,"" because anyone read as masculine by this system is seen as a threat to others first and foremost. I remember how that awful young lady talked to me, like I was a potential school shooter. It made me feel like scum. Like I was a disease. Like I needed to annihilate every trace of myself, like when she told me 'your friends aren't therapists,' that it was indication I was the problem. 

Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not. Maybe I don't care anymore. Maybe I'm sick of trying to have my pain be understood that I want to die just so that everything will stop. I entered this world very, very frightened, and have only grown more scared with each passing say. I'm a young adult now. The fucked up part is that my life isn't truly that bad. I've got stable housing for now, though I might have to move in with my abuser again thanks to getting fired if nothing else comes through. I have a master's degree, but it's in a dying industry that AI is tearing to pieces. I can write. I can make art. I can act. I can sing. I can do all these things that I once loved and maybe still do, but none of the social skills needed to make it anywhere in a cutthroat world. My inner child wants to scream and cry at being made to try. 

People tell me I have to try. 

Maybe I don't want to try. 

Maybe I don't want to live. 

It should be my right to choose, shouldn't it?

Telling me I have no choice makes me want to swan dive off the nearest parking garage right here and now. 

I know it won't fix anything. 

I know inevitably I'd fail and be forced onto some drugs that might actually make me want to smile again for a year or so before I'd inevitably get another job where I'll accidentally piss off another insane boss because I didn't smile wide enough at their small talk and I'll be right back where I started. 

I was set up to fail from the jump. 

I have a car, a home, a girlfriend, hobbies, friends, education, memories, skills and qualifications. But...

But none of that matters under capitalism. 

Sorry.

I'll smile at the customers wider next time, I'll kiss the interviewer's ass more next time, I'll be more submissive and agreeable, I won't cry, I won't say anything the next time a supervisor puts hands on me. I'm an abuse magnet. Everywhere I go, people see a victim. And they're right. Capitalism breeds victims and I'm a prime model. 

Sorry. 

Sorry for existing. Sorry. I'm so sorry I made you upset.

I don't want to do this anymore, man. 

I want to run into the desert and let the elements take me. I want to go back to the bathroom where it happened and self-immolate while singing my favorite songs until I die. I want to bleed out in a field of beautiful flowers, so that something gorgeous might grow from the demise of so pathetic and sad a life. I want to sink to the bottom of the ocean and let corals and starfish grow upon my sunken bones. I want the atoms of my body that once belonged to stars to drift off into the aether and become part of something great. 

If I cannot have a beautiful life, perhaps I might have a beautiful death. 

I'm scared. I want my mom. I want to go home. 

I can't do this anymore. 

I'm a prisoner in this torture chamber, and it's never going to stop until Death takes me. I haven't the strength to destroy me myself, so I'll keep trudging on day by day until something finally breaks me. 

I want to go home to my old bedroom with the dinosaurs on the walls I painted with my sisters and my grandmother before my childhood cat knocked paint over everywhere and tracked it across half the house before we caught him, curl up in my racecar bed with all my stuffed animals - the teddy bear, the pink unicorn, the Pokemon plushies, everyone - and close my eyes and let it all just disappear. 

I want to go home.

signalife,Losing the fear of death,2,1c5gyy9,1,"It's cliché to say but depression has been a constant shadow in my (admittedly short) life. Very early I've been told I lost that ""brightness"" in my eyes, or my smile: around eleven or twelve (entering the first year of high school where I'm from) depression was a settled matter even though I hadn't necessarily seeked any professional diagnosis; you don't need a genius to tell you a kid doing self harm for attention and contemplating suicide isn't quite normal. 

The truth is I always stood aside, among both peers and family (quite literally been called the ""black sheep"" at family dinners). Sometimes said times aside from everyone were a choice because I'm a calm person who does enjoy alone time, a lot of other times I wasn't even given the choice and was just brushed off. I can understand if people around me ever felt put off by my attitudes, considering a depressed child with built up rage and recitant to touch is almost like trying to befriend a feral animal, but alas, these same people people proclaim familial unity through all ups and downs...

My first attempt at suicide was around fourteen; I'd already been fantasizing about jumping off the highest ground in my school building (private school, grades weren't great, I was realizing some things and teenagers are just assholes) buy anyway, I tried overdosing on whatever the fuck I could find and it obviously didn't work and just made me sick for weeks—I have trouble swallowing pills now from that. Second and third were around fifteen to seventeen I believe, my parents were made aware about my first attempt by my therapist at the time and called me stupid and selfish for even thinking of that and to this day make fun of it and me, so I tried jumping onto traffic and later hanging myself, neither of which resulted in anything.

Per the title you could have guessed why: all these attempts were kind of halfassed and more of attention ploys that anything else because I'd been really afraid of what would really happen afterward so even if I tried and I had these ideations and thoughts and plans, I always managed to find even the silliest thing to keep myself alive: a song that I played on looped because I want to listen to it ""one last time""; a new movie is coming out that I want to watch; my favorite music group is performing at the biggest stage of their country at the end of the year; I want to read, I want to study. And they worked, my fear of death was very strong and anything that could divert me from it served well enough and I'm almost twenty one now –when I didn't think I'd make it to eighteen– and have (or had) passions and ambitions. 

However, with age, each year I found myself changing, maybe neither for better or for worse but I changed, and so did my knowledge and my views: my conscience. My entire country (as per every other country in the world I'm sure) is a battle- a bloodfield nowadays, the world at large sure is; I can't help but feel so much and it has caused me personal troubles at home even. Anxiety this year has skyrocketed, there's not a second of time where I ever feel at peace, I don't leave my house much and even as I type I feel my heart racing. I am so lost and very, very alone despite people around me all the time. I've no idea where even the nearest future, like, tomorrow, is headed, much less my life in the long run, to the point I'm not sure there's a future at all. All my passions lie dead on the ground, there's little to nothing keeping me going, even the excuses don't work this time. Everything is so numb and meaningless despite my active effort to be positive and encourage others to be hopeful and think positively. 

I've been writing suicide letters, I'd never done that in previous attempts it makes it feel so much realer this time, a proper goodnye. You could argue this is one, too. I'm not so scared of death anymore, I contemplate it almost constantly, always thinking of how I could take my own life, placing a date, treating myself before the inevitable comes. I did think, since November or so, to get myself checked into a mental health hospital, but I don't think it'll do much of anything, am too self aware and it's so easy to just get away with being okay.

I've never not thought about suicide. It has been engraved in my mind for a long time that I would die young and that it would be by suicide; I was naïve in thinking this could ever go otherwise. Maybe it'll be my own birthday present.",1713276367.0,

I feel like everything is pushing me towards suicide and I feel like no matter how much I ask for help we're advocate for myself that nobody truly hears me. I just don't have the voice of people want to listen to. I'm not the type of person that people will save before it's too late. I have tried everything I don't have friends, I don't know how to navigate the different resources to get true help. Even tonight I tried calling for the first time a domestic abuse hotline only for them to find out that I'm just a tenant and I live in an emotionally abusive household. 

Why can't I just find sustainable help? Why does it take so many steps and jumping through hoops just to find a safe place to sleep at night? People act as though tenants have all of these rights but when it really comes down to it they have to still advocate for themselves and if they're in a situation like mine, who is going to believe that it's too much? 

I'm hurting, I don't want to commit suicide but I cannot find help. All I have to do is buy some alcohol get drunk enough and I have enough pills to hopefully end it. How can I even have a possible chance If every single time I ask for help I just get ignored? 

Why should I have to sit here wondering how I can possibly feel safe in the depths of depression and completely overwhelmed? How did I end up being one of those people who are just another statistic just another grave site there's another sad story about suicide when in reality I have asked for help and so many ways but because I don't have a strong enough voice nobody hears me.",1713244860.0,

It feels absolutely insane and selfish. I'm a normal guy otherwise. Not depressed for the most part (anymore), not lonely for the most part (anymore), just really really ready to go. Is that absolutely insane? It feels just batshit crazy to me that my whole being is just ready to stop being.

It's not that I want to die anymore (I used to), but rather that I spent so much time previously wanting it that it's all I can think about now. I don't know. I've just been done for a very long time. ",1713253610.0,
fisht4il,i cant stop thinking about it,2,1c5c6o9,0,"last night was one of the hardest night that I've ever had not actually the night itself but the whole day I felt so miserable and I felt so hopeless and helpless to be honest. at uni everything was so fucked up I couldn't handle the anxiety and I couldn't handle the stress I was forced to be in, my professor; I think she noticed that I'm not okay mentally but she refuses to reschedule my final project and she told me that I have to do it in front of the class but my anxiety is so severe that I can do it and i felt like there's no escape but to kill myself

my brain is not functioning. i can't think, it's so hard for me to think actually because there's only one thing I think about it and it's suicide. I think about suicide when I wake up, when I go to bed, when I eat, when I shower, when I'm in the bathroom, when I exercise. it's the only thing that's going on in my head and whenever somebody jokes about it like they go ""I'm gonna kill myself"" I get confused. Are you really suicidal? these are the signs or are you just joking around with it? arw you going through the same thing im going through? 

I want to help people who suffer with it but I can't help anybody because I'm not able to help myself  and I get so triggered whenever somebody mention anything about killing themselves because that's the only thing I think about so I really don't know what to do to stop it I want to reach for help, but I tried before it didn't work, I'm not saying that there is no cure, it just never worked for me. I'm not really sure if I want to recover. I feel im weird attachment to this thing like I feel that's the only thing that is me, this is me this is my personality. I'm a depressed person that's who I am so if it stops, who will I be?

Other-Radio-900,I will commit suicide if I don't leave schools,2,1c5bs2q,0,"Okay so need a little help. I'm a 15F and basically last year when I was in year 9 and I decided to move schools for more opportunity/better education for year 10. I decided to move back to my old school (That i haven't attended in 3 years.)  At the time this seemed like a good idea, and even though at the time I knew I was leaving my friends/memories, I felt like this was a good idea. Though I wish I didn't feel like this. I regret moving schools.

To make this easier to explain lets name the school I regret moving to School 1 and the school I wanna move back to School 2. Basically as soon as I stepped back into School 1 I felt out of place. The last time I saw these people was in year 6 and they were so much more different, which I knew was to be expected but still it felt weird seeing these people. I still was in contact with my friend group in School 1 so I didn't have to worry about being alone at lunch. The problem is that these friends are not as mature as me and I didn't really realize this until I started hanging out with them. Our interests and hobbies are not really the same and I don't feel happy when I'm with then. Don't get me wrong in primary school these people were so nice and they still are, its just that I don't fit in with them anymore and I can't join a different friend group because I wouldn't fit in with them either. Its a small school so there is only like 50 students in our year level and majority of them are the popular kids which I would not fit in as they are very sporty and extroverted and I'm not. There is also the nerdy/gamer people which is not me at all. There is also some other groups but in this case I just wont fit in at all. I hate feeling like this, I feel alone all the time even though I have people around me. I always miss my old friends and wish that at recess and lunch I was with them at School 2.

Another reason why I wanna move is because the school I go to is an IB program not VCE which I am use to for high school. There is nothing wrong with IB i just find the workload a lot more different and I felt more comfortable doing VCE. I also can't stand how small the school is, idk how to explain it, its like I constantly feel trapped.

I just really miss my old friends, wearing my old uniform, taking my old school bus. Everything I miss everything.

I've only been here for two terms and I already committed suicide twice during those two terms, because I felt like if I was to go all the stress, problems and loneliness would be gone. I tried taking pills the first time, but I just threw them all up and the second time I tried grabbing a knife but I backed out. I also have social anxiety, so I feel like everyone hates me and the world would be a better place without me. And before anyone says give it some time you'll get use to it. I can't get use to this. I cannot stand being here I just hate it. I will not get use to this and the longer I stay here the more I am going up to my breaking point.

Now you might be thinking to yourself, why not tell your parents to move you back? well here is the thing. Finances in my family is not that great and School 1 is very expensive when it comes to school fees, I also had to pay for new uniforms and books to go to this school. I've only been here for two terms and If I tell my parents to move me back to School 2 for next semester, I feel like I just wasted all my parents money and time for no reason. I also made it a big deal last year to move schools even though my parents told me it was expensive. I wish I wasn't so selfish at the time.

I am also scared to tell my parents how I feel and why I wanna move schools, my mum is understanding and my dad is like a basic Indian dad (always angry all the time). I feel like if I tell my mum I'm suicidal and wanna move schools she will feel worries and stressed and if she tells my dad this idk how he would react. I'm not sure if he will be upset at me or stressed. I am also scared if I tell my parents, I will get my hopes up to high and they will tell me I cant move back or my old school will not allow me to come back in term 3.

I know that if I do not move out of this school and go back in term 3 I will not be alive anymore. I really am impatient and I am slowly losing control. I can only hold on for so little and I feel like crying every single minute. If I can't go back to School 2, where I was a lot happier, I am gonna stab myself or do anything so that I won't suffer anymore because I can't keep praying to God every night to kill me in my sleep or waking up every morning and getting ready knowing I am gonna go to a place I hate. If I am able to move schools and go back to my old school next semester, then at least I am able to know that I only have a term left of misery and things will go back to normal when I move back.

I have made a plan to tell my mum how I feel and tell her I'm really suicidal and I wanna move back to schools. Idk how to do it or when is the right time. Please can someone help me on how I can tell my mum this and prepare myself for my dads reaction when my mum tells my dad later on. I am really struggling right now and I pray every single day that I can go back to my old school.",1713259431.0,

However, I did forget to write this, so I’m writing it now. Like a week ago, I had a bit of a meltdown. I don’t know what you call it. I was in the middle of yk listening to music, and then the thought hit me. I have free will. (Not really now that I look at it but that’s what I thought at the time.) I could do whatever I want to myself. I could hurt myself. I felt my fingers dig into my legs, and I remember scratching at my right hand really hard. My vision like blackened if that makes sense, and my ears rang. I felt everything sort of melt away, like I could only focus on one thing. It wasn’t a terrifying experience, just different. Also, my small hallucinations are back, along with my paranoia. It’s not as bad, I’m just seeing small things so far. I saw a ghostly outline of white, like someone’s vest. I also saw shadows across the wall, a snake in my bathroom (?), hands reaching out the doorway, etc. These last very shortly though, and are usually gone with a blink of an eye. Usually. I had some which go away longer. I feel like everyone’s out to get me, you know?

This starts to feel like destiny to me, like I'm meant to be melancholic and depressed for the rest of my life. I started to feel better at the start of 2024 and I thought things are gonna get better. I quit my medicine and therapy (mainly because I don't want my family to waste more money on these things, especially when the people that 'treated' me doesn't even gaf, I live in a country that mental issues are heavily neglected). But it's getting to me again. Those thoughts I can't get it out of my head. 

I have no friends at all, online or irl. I have no one to talk to. It's not that I mind, I kinda already got used to it. One thing I hate about myself is that I always live to impress. It's exhausting and soooo much pressure. I'm never good enough, there'll always be someone better than me. I'm jealous and it's painful. I know I have problems, hell, I even know what problems I have. But I can't fix it. And I don't have the motivation to do so. Suicide seems like the quickest and most effective solution of all.

I attempted suicide a few years ago. I used to have a few friends, they called my parents and 'saved' me. I didn't want to be saved. I wish I locked the door and succeeded. 

I used to have serious problems with my parents, that's what makes the suicide a few years ago so much easier than now. We changed, we grew. We learned to tolerate each other. If I suicide now, it's gonna ruin their lives, my grandma grandpa's lives. They cared, I kinda don't want them to feel bad.

Round-Appearance7898,Extinguish the Sun,2,1c5eten,0,"Like an end to all of the world as we know it. No bombshelter bullshit, or prepping to survive. Even if one would survive, there would be noone and nothing else left.

This ""wish"" or hope gives me some sort of peace.
Because suicide is more like a fantasy to me, than an actual option. My parents, my sister and a handfull of good friends would be hurt and perhaps blame themselves if I'd end myself. I would've prefered that it would be an actual ""backupplan"" though.
The thought of losing any of them breaks my heart already, and I truly hope my time runs out first, as to be sure that I wouldn't ever have to mourn them.
It sounds very selfish, I know... 
Thats why a total wipeout of everything that existed is ideal in my eyes.

For the better part of 15years now (I'm in my 30s) I've struggled keeping up a ""mask"" or facade just to run along with what society expects from us. There have been times where I was happy, sure. Most recently this happened (ended) 2 maybe 3 years ago. During covid.

Then I lived a life I never imagined was possible, I was lucky enough to be in a situation where I didn't have to work for an employer, didn't have rent or most of the usual monthly payments, and lived a very minimalistic yet simpel life. Together with a great partner who shared the same beliefs and felt similarly about the world we live in.
With her I could drop the facade, release the mask and actually show myself in a way I've only did with 2 or 3 very close friends. She wasnt just my girlfriend, she was (is) also a best friend.
All we did for work, was taking care of ourselves to provide for ourselves and other than that we smoked pot whenever we liked, we fucked, laughed, took naps whenever we liked.
This ended a few years ago, first the lifestyle (for me), when I got a new job and appartment, and I found myself back into this hamsterwheel, chasing the cheese.

Immediatly I felt the stress returning. The disgust of society and hatred toward the regular, 9-5 routine.
Needless to say, this (amongst other reasons) didnt improve the relationship we were having, and this too ended 2 years ago. I still miss her tremendously. (you got me, it is ofcourse a heartbreak/sad romance story that got me here)
We are still in touch, but after 2 years I'm beginning to lose any hope of picking this back up with her, nomatter how badly I want to. She seems to have moved on with her live, and being friends with me is apparently enough for her. And at this point, I don't see anything I can or should do to convince her otherwise.

And even though in these last 2 years, I've experienced some good times. But this was more of a day here and there. Perhaps a weekend. And then this void would present itself again.
Loneliness, anger and mostly a form of grief are feelings that are constantly with me.
It got to the point that on a daily basis, I visually think of a revolver, and the taste of the barrel.
Or how the fibers of rope would feel around my throat... 
Or: what if I just let go of the steeringwheel one day... These admittedly dark thoughts actually give me some relief. A feeling of freedom even.
But, as I've said in the beginning, I'd hate to leave behind someone who cares for me who'll be hurt or feel guilty or whatever. So I struggle on through life.
Life equals suffering, as Buddhism has taught me.

But this struggle, this pace of survivalism in the daily routine, makes me more and more careless.
I don't care about my job, or my future, very little interest in the hobbies I used to enjoy, or whatever. Let alone my wellbeing.. I think I've read somewhere that there's a name for this. Like a passive suicidal state or something.
I try to make most of the day. Live it like it could be my last. 
In other words: I try to enjoy it, here and now. It's my overthinking that often gets in the way of doing so. Then I'll find myself in an almost katatonic state of mind, and general unease or annoyance in my daily routine. 
Like: what if I get hit by a bus tomorrow? (Yay) That would mean I used my last hours working for a boss who doesnt care about me, paying bills and taxes to a government who doesnt care about me, but worst of all: being mentally stuck in a vicious circle of overthinking and missing someone who used to love me, but also missing a live that feels as if it has been taken away from me.

The fact that there is such a stigma around suicide (and mental health in general) also makes this worse in my opinion. Whenever I do feel the need to talk about this subject, most people (not just family or loved ones, also therapists or people who are supposed to help) say stuff like ""no, you have so much to live for"" or some generic shit like that. There is hardly anyone who I actually can have a genuine conversation with regarding these feelings or this topic. My best friend, and ex excluded. With them, I was able to. They understood. But if the people who you can talk to are the same whose absence from your life cause the pain you are in... Well that's anothere paradox to this whole predicament.",1713270345.0,

Being abandoned by my parents and abused by my grandmother. I saw my grandfather die in front of me from a heart attack; this is the incident that scarred me. I’ve moved state to state multiple times and I was finally able to settle somewhere.

I have self harmed before at a time when I did not know what else to do. I thought it’d be an easy thing to do, and at first it was until I started becoming numb to the pain. Being a black man, the scars either faded or ended up being concealed by the burns and various cuts I would receive from my job. 

I have been in a few relationships. All ending because of me or my former partners and the last time I was actually with someone was 2017-2018 so it’s has been a while. I’ve discovered that love is a necessity. Everyone needs love at some point or another, but it’s hard. 

My ex was a wonderful woman. She inspired the growth I needed to become who I am today and I can not find anyone like that anymore. Not to help me grow but someone who understands.

But our marriage finally fell apart soon after he was born. 
I refuse to be the example of masculinity to my son. I'm just the worst one. Only a rapist would be worse. Besides, I can't afford to buy a car or a home. I decided to neglect myself until my heart stops, that way, my family can collect insurance. Do you think it is a good plan? Here are my overall health stats:
- Obese
- Smoker
- Drinker
- Extremely stressed 
- Sleep 4-5 h daily 
- Addicted to caffeine pills and energy drinks
- Addicted to sugary foods

I know there's a risk to still make it to old age. But what are the odds I will die soon? And most importantly, how will it affect my son? I know my wife will marry again soon after. I actually pray she will marry someone with more money so my son's education won't be compromised. 

Thanks for reading

tabantha_thot,I hope I was your hard part,2,1c5a68d,0,"I'm sorry that I hurt you. I hope I was the worst thing that ever happens to you, because I can't stomach the idea of you having to deal with anyone worse than me. I know that I was the red flag you saw too late, but I hope you at least learned how to better spot red flags. I wish you'd never met me, but I'm at least glad you now know that love isn't enough to stay with someone who makes you so sad. I'm sorry I made you sad. But I hope I was your hard part and that it all gets better from here. You might not know I'm gone for a long time. I'll keep my death quiet as possible. I hope you've had time to heal and move on by time you find out. Better yet, I hope you never do.  I smile to myself even now because I'm picturing you finding someone else to love you as much as I did but without all of my baggage. Remember when we were happy together? You can have that again, but without the crash and burn. You're going to have that, I know it. But I'll never put anyone else through what I put you through. I'll never make anyone cry like that again. And since I'm so co-dependent, I don't trust myself not to, so I have to do the only thing that will make absolutely certain I don't. ",1713252679.0,

i know all the platitudes about how time heals i've lives through many breakups but this is the only one i care about. the only thing that's made me attempt to take my life and makes me want to do it again. i have never loved anyone so much. i don't recognize myself loving him because i would so easily give up (and have given up) the world if it meant he was by my side

BlackandBlue718,I’m tired to say the least,3,1c57p7j,0,"So, without going into too much detail, life’s been a lot and I don’t think I can do it anymore, I’ve been contemplating about taking my own life. I’ve been thinking about it for a couple of months now and at first I was able to fend it off and distract myself from them, keep the thoughts at bay, but as time has gone on, they just keep getting worse and worse, the porn where I pretty much stay up till the early parts of the morning, sleep depriving myself so that it doesn’t come to happen. I don’t much care for myself and don’t see a bright nor good future ahead of me, really the only thing that’s stopping me, is my friends and family, or those that really care and have love for me. I keep thinking, “today might finally be it”, and I feel so close to doing it, but then I have memories and thoughts about everything and everyone, even those who aren’t even in my life anymore. I think about some of the great times we had and even the terrible ones, but because we were together during them, and I also think about how they would take it, my death I mean. And I know, some of them much harder than others, especially my father and best friend, I have a feeling it would truly kill them from the inside, and it’s just a shitty feeling. But I also think to myself, “fuck…what an amazing feeling to just not wake up again, to not care about anything or anyone again without any care or trouble”, it’s almost a soothing feeling and I will admit makes it even easier to go through with it. And even last year, it almost to it, but then I met someone. She was a good friend, and saved my life without even realizing it, and she helped so much. But things happened and afterwards, things got worse again and the feelings and thoughts came back, and with everything else in life and my depression seems like is getting worse and worse by the day. I have been in therapy for some time now, and it has been great, but deep down, it’s like…I don’t care anymore, I don’t care for myself nor do I care about anything in my future, because I don’t see one nor anything good coming from it. And I guess what I’m trying to say from all of this is that I’m afraid…if that makes any sense  ",1713243240.0,

I dont cut myself, but i scratched my wrist pretty badly on axsident and my dad thought i cut myself and started yelling at me for it calling me emo and saying a bunch of messed up shit, i love my dad but i dont like him at all. I share a room with my step brother, he is genuinly the worst person i know, i cant get a break from it.

At school im a fucking loser, no one likes me, im the weird annoying kid i guess. But this girl liked me, and we started talking. I know to adults kid realationships sound stupid but try to understand. She was really the only reason i looked foward to waking up. Most nights i hoped i wouldnt wake up in the morning but when we started talking that changed. But of course it goes wrong right? Me and her get in some argument about something stupid and she says the whole we should stop talking thing, and then she texts me in a like a week and things go back to normal. This had happened like 4 times. But this time it was fr. The thing is that she really likes me, and i dont understand why. Im a peice of shit loser no one likes, shes called me a pathological liar and shes right. The thing is im afraid of myself, theres something serouisly wrong with me, i am not ok at all. I want it all to end. I cant handle this much pain anymore. Ive been numb to everything for the past year. My life has gotten so much worse. I thought it was bad then. Someone please tell me u understand. She was all i had and now shes gone to. All i feel is stress anxiety pain depression and FEAR. The only reason i havent killed myself is because of my religion. Im a christian, not that i live by it anyway. But i think god has a plan for me, weather u reading this are religious or not GOD is the only reason i havent ended it. I already know what i would do, how i would do it. I plan it out in my head, i plan ""smool smooting"" in my head, ""deleting"" everyone who is mean to me for no reason. I feel like im sick in the head. I see things that arent there sometimes and i hear voices rarely. I hallucinated a conversation with the girl i talked about earlier, then i opened my texts and the whole convo was GONE. i feel scared that i may be INSANE. Why do I have to be like this. Why couldnt i be the other guy. Im fucking losing it. I want it to all end now. Its 11:38 as of typing this, and i genuily hope with a small DARK part of my heart that i dont wake up. Its fucking sickning to me. My stomac is in knots constsntly. I consider suicide everyday but i think if i get any lower i might DO IT.

Beautiful_Gain_9032,Fear of death is ironically making me wanna kms,4,1c4z9px,2,"the main reason is simply the fact that life is meaningless, and i i believe that ""making your own meaning"" is BS. if it helps people great, but my mind only follows what it thinks is true, not what it wants to be true. Telling me to create meaning in a meaningless world is just the same illogic of ""join a religion you know is false because it will give you meaning"". It doesnt work that way. Just because muslims, for instance, might feel a meaning to live from their faith, thats only because they actually believe it. Someone who doesnt believe it wont get meaning from islam because they dont think it has any basis. I see ""create your own meaning"" just as stupid as pretending to believe a religion i don't. if the religion isnt actually true, that means the ""answers"" they give for the meaning of life are also untrue.

i have no reason to live. whats the point of anything? why work? to make money. Why make money? to pay bills. Why pay bills? so i have a home. Why have a home? so i dont die. Why not die? idk, im going to die anyways, all im doing is prolonging the inevitable.

Thinking about death so much makes me want to die. every time i hear a news story about someone dying i feel intense pain for them, even criminals like OJ simpson, hearing he died the other day sent me into a spiral thinking about death. All i think about is death. What it will feel like, being horrified of when my time will come. Its a family members birth day, when i think about her age my mind automatically does the math and realizes i only have 20 more years with them, aka 1-my-lifetimes worth of time left max, if im lucky. Then i realize i only have 2x my current lifetime of time left to live before i die. I then get overwhelmed about everything i want and realize ill never get it because im disabled and too much of a social anxiety freak to even step foot outside my home, and too paranoid to share my secrets with anyone irl, let alone find someone who will ever want me. 

I wake up after 10 hours of solid sleep and feel like i havent slept in 10 days. If i walk .1 mile i feel like im going to faint and wont quit yawning for the remainder of the day, and cant stand because i get so tired. all i think about is death and how im slowly killing myself and i have no power to change it. All of this helplessness makes me just wish i had the courage to end it myself. That way theres no worrying about when, no more suffering, no more stress. But then my mind thinks about death again and wants to run away, but then the anxiety that death gives me makes me want to die. Its an awful vicious loop where the more stressed/depressed/anxious i get the more i want to die, but the more that i want to die, the more stressed/depressed/anxious i get. im so tired.

I keep blaming myself.,2,1c55rrr,6,"I'm really struggling after a complicated situation with a guy I met on Tinder. We clicked instantly, sharing many interests and values, and after a few dates, things progressed quickly. However, we soon encountered trust issues. He went through my phone without permission, misinterpreted what he saw, and accused me of talking to other guys. Despite my efforts to clarify things, he didn't believe me and broke things off. In a moment of desperation, I even reached out to his mom (who doesn't even know me), which I regret. We tried to reconcile, but he expressed that he found me too needy and co-dependent, and ultimately, he ended things, citing his own personal issues and the need for space. I was deeply invested in this relationship, especially since I lost my virginity to him. This was all in a span of one month, and I truly liked him and wanted to be with him for the long term. I'm strongly mourning what could've been. I feel like this is all my fault. 

I just want to call him and text him to work things out, but I know it would do more harm than good if I did that right now.

Pero si hoy muero quiero que todos mis seres queridos y personas que conforman o conformaron parte de mi vida. Sepan que los aprecio y me hizo muy feliz que me apoyaran y estuvieran hay. Soy egoísta y decidí que si se me presentaba la oportunidad de morir sin hacerlo a propósito o en su totalidad lo iba a aceptar. Espero estar dramatizando y que se me juzge por decir todo esto.

With anything else, if you want to get someone to do something, it's a mutual, consensual exchange. The burden is on you to show someone else it's in their best interest to do what you want.

Yet it's somehow okay to deny people death. The sweet freedom that comes only with death. The peace, the rest. To force someone to live is to violate the sanctity of their free will.

It's okay that some, even most people want to live. That's a personal preference and by no means a universal. How arrogant, how self-centered, must people assume their desires must apply to others? What if we did this with food? With careers? With friendships? With how we spend our time? With sex? It would be a supreme violation of the individual.

Potential-Historian6,S.O.S. ,1,1c57p3m,0,"If anyone takes the time to read this thank you. Never done anything like this but here it goes. Don't think this is really gonna help but im running out of options and maybe putting some of it in the endless void of the internet will give me some sense of peace even if just for a moment. Sorry in advance for the bad spelling and being all over the place. Not sure where to start. I turn 28 next week and my life is pretty terrible all because of bad decisions and some trauma both physical and mental. I went through alot when I was younger. I've had 4 open heart surgerys the last one when I just turned 21 and the timing of it all couldn't have been worse. Dropped out of college. The only girl I've ever loved broke up with me about a month before I got the news about my next surgery and she wanted to get back together the next day but I was young and stupid and did everything I could to convince myself that's not what I wanted and damn was I wrong. Whoever said better to have loved and lost than never have loved at all can go fuck themselves. I guess all anyone wants is to feel loved but I tried to convince myself otherwise and became so cold and isolated. I walked away from something so special..Didn't even have the spine to text her back.. I handled it so poorly...I really wanted to reach out not long after but never did because it just didn't seem right and for some reason lately all I can think about is how different my life would be if I was just honest with people who cared about me. Her brother in law was like my brother and always tried to reach out and i was to spineless to even reply half the time and when i did i was never honest. I just know I wouldn't have become the monster I am now. But I knew either she'd pull me out of this hell or I'd pull her in and I guess I made the right choice. Selfishly I wish I could go back but I can't. And fuck me it's consuming. But went through what I did all alone and it changed me. I've spent the better half of the last decade being nihilistic, drunk and lonely trying to fight fire with fire and boy did I get burned. I hate this felling..it's so consuming. From the outside looking in it'd be hard to tell.. Obviously goes without saying but im not bragging about any of this I'm talking about fucking killing myself to complete strangers on the internet for god sake...if anything it just proves how weak minded I've become..I'm lucky enough to have family and a few Friends that love me. I know how stupid and selfish it is but there are days i wish i didn't or i wouldn't even think twice about it. Im pretty tall, in good shape and supposedly good looking. Wouldn't say I'm rich but i have money and always will but let me assure those of you that think money would help it doesn't. What it does do is very bad things to good people and like Tony Stark said no amount of it has ever bought a second of time. I'd give every nickel I have and ever will for just a single minute of the past back. But nothing will ever change what I went through, what I did to her and how I handled it. I've tried everything to escape this feeling. I've talked to doctors. I've talked to family and friends. I've exercised 3 to 5 days a week for months now. I've tried doing things I used to enjoy but I just can't shake this. The only reason I haven't put a bullet in my head yet is because I know the pain it'll cause my Freinds and family especially my mom. But it's gotten so bad I just don't know what to do. I live in America and grew up around guns and hunting so that's how I'm gonna do it. I literally have a bullet with my name carved on it. 45 acp black tallon. I just don't wanna risk surviving and don't want to feel any pain or discomfort. I've experienced enough of that for 100 lifetimes. If there is a hell I'm certainly going for the things i have and will do but thats fine because I'm gonna find whatever it is that did this to me and its coming with me. But with my luck when i ask to see who or what it was the devil will just hand me a mirror because at the end of the day i was the one that did what i did. Not speaking to her again was so spineless regardless of what i thought about my health.. Goddammit I really am trying to look at the bright side even tried faith but it's hard to believe in a loving and caring God if you have suffered the way I have and saw the things I've seen. I was 12 during my 3rd surgery and experienced things in a children's ICU that no one ever should, let alone a kid. I saw kids die. I heard it. I smelled it. Saw parents get dragged out screaming the name of their dead child. I still feel it in my bones. Was never really honest with anyone about all that either. For some reason I just try to run away and bury my problems but the cup finally runneth over.
I guess its the combination of alot of bad things but man does it suck. I'm fighting every day not to but i just don't know how much longer I can. God if I was just honest. If you made it this far I do appreciate it. If you've ever experienced this feeling please leave a reply it'd be nice to actually hear from someone who has experienced similar feelings. I know how hard it is to talk to people about it..the best I can do is make some post about it on the internet no ones probably even gonna read.

Hope you find peace and happiness.

missile_storm,My Thoughts As A 17y/old Male,1,1c57m9o,1,"I have suicidal thoughts everyday and as of recent it has gotten worse. I’ve realized that I'm not sought out or wanted by anyone, not even my friend group. I’ve come to say this because my “friend group"" consists of me and 8 other people yet I'm never really invited to any of the hangouts or to go do things anywhere and they constantly make plans without even telling me or inviting me, and sometimes they talk about the plans in front of my face like I’m not even there and if I then ask what they are talking about they change it up and act like it was nothing. Two of them seem to care about me and say that they like me more than they like the others but I find it hard to believe them. It might just be the fact that I don’t believe them because I’ve been betrayed by people that I trusted and told my trauma to so many times in my life, but when they say it I just get this feeling that it isn’t true. The only time I’m invited anywhere is mostly when I’m needed to fill in a slot or for them to try to get me to help pay for things. They have a group chat that has everyone in it and one that has everyone but me in it’ which the second one is the one they talk in most of the time when they are trying to make plans for things. I’ve been used throughout most of my life by people and I’ve lost everyone that had either shown interest in me or had actually cared about me, and when I say lost I don’t mean it as if they moved or we grew apart. I mean it as in they either killed themselves or got murdered by people either in front of my eyes or at their home by a family member, and I’ve always blamed myself for not being strong enough to save them or help them so I got into lifting weights and got decently strong but then had gotten a sciatic nerve injury and hadn’t been able to do much and so as of now while I’m in my senior year of high school and I’ve lost the will to live and am on the edge of killing myself. Another thing that adds onto it is that I had met a girl a while back in July of last year and we hit it off and started dating. It was going well and we both had some things in common. We both liked the same music and acted pretty similar for the most part, and everyone who saw us said we were a good couple. She also had some trauma that she was worried to tell me at first cause she thought I was gonna leave her when I found out like how her ex’s did. Instead I just let her cry to me and had loved her even more because she trusted me enough to tell me everything she has been through. She later asked me to talk about my trauma to her so I did, which in turn had actually made us a lot closer and more comfortable together. After a while of it going good though we both got hit with some more trauma which had made her break up with me and in turn all of my past trauma came flooding back in and had hit me like a train. It has been months since then and I still can’t get over her. I tried looking for other people but none of them had been anywhere near as nice, passionate, and caring as she was. All of this brings me to where this weekend I had gone to my senior prom and had seen her and a mutual friend of ours that I hadn't talked to since the first semester because she went to online schooling. My ex had invited our friend because she really wanted to go but had to get invited by someone in order to be able to go. While at the prom that friend had come up to me and asked if this dude had liked my ex, which I had told her that he does but she doesn’t show any interest in him. My friend had responded to that by saying that she doesn’t show interest in guys to which I said that she had shown interest in me before we started dating. My friend had then responded to that by saying that yes she did but she now hates men, so I asked why which she had in turn said that it was because I was my ex’s first time of ever dating a male and that our relationship hadn’t ended well so she no longer likes men. That means that I had apparently been a horrible boyfriend to her or something so now I really just don’t know what to do with my life anymore. So at this point in time I'm really just debating on ending it all because all I ever do in life is mess up and bring pain to people around me.

False-Quarter-5417,I messed up,1,1c56vqp,0,"my laziness finally caught up to me. I messed up my whole life from being lazy. I can no longer see a future. I think once tomorrow hits my family will find out how much of a disappointment I really am. That’s why I hope to do it tonight. I used to be the kid who got pretty good grades and my parents were happy for me. So they began to trust me. It got to the point where they wouldn’t ask me to show them my grades, and I even got a scholarship during high school where instead of taking high school classes I could take college classes at the university, so I did. I think this was my biggest mistake. I had never touched an ounce of homework I guess I always got lucky doing before class and teachers. So when I got the college classes that homework hurt so hard. I always prioritized my free time at home, and it started damaging my grades. Badly. I managed to pass 4/5 classes on the first semester. I failed English. It’s important to note that the year before I had gotten my first C and D, and no one noticed. No one told them about anything. I got lucky. I wished I hadn’t. I wished the school would’ve told them earlier and I had gotten caught without the repercussions being so bad. The second semester started and I don’t know why, I think I got cocky or something because I never showed up to any of my classes. I just didn’t want to go to school.  1-2 months ago my school called because I missed too many days of school and informed my parents that I had failed English Here I am on my second semester failing 6/6 classes. My brain did not process what it was doing at the time. They asked if I was failing the classes currently and I admitted and said yes. But it was like 2 or 3 weeks into the semester so I could recover. All they basically said was lock in. This same day they found that I was cutting myself all over my body. They didn’t know how to handle it and I don’t think they were in a position where we can afford  therapist or however that works. Nothing changed. They trusted me again. After breaking the trust , they gave it to me again and broke it again. I continued not to go to class. I guess I was embarrassed to go to a class I never showed up before. But then again I feeel like I’m just always making excuses, it’s toxic trait I have and the more I think about it, I’m not a good person. Everyone thinks I am but I’m not. I just want this feeling to go away. I wish I could just decide not to wake up one day because I’ve gotten so close to ending it but I never have enough force to push the knife into my heart, but now I have no excuse I’m backed up against a wall I put myself in.

My autism makes it very hard to function in my day to day life.  I'm in college rn and it's just extremely hard to function like a normal human being.  My dorm room is a fucking mess and the floor is covered with trash and it got so bad there's fucking mice.  Imagine ""rotmaxxing"" on tiktok but literally.  I don't have a roommate but it's still super awful.  I've missed so much class and although my grades are decent I'm still struggling a ton.  I go days without showering or even washing my face or changing my fucking clothes, and I only eat like 600 calories a day.  None of this is by choice, but the structure of living in a dorm vs an apartment or whatever is super super fucking difficult.

I'm a very fucking bitter person.  I have so much resentment and anger bc I have literally zero supports for my disability and instead of actually trying to solve it or push through like a normal person it just turns into anger.  I have a deep-seated anger towards more disabled special needs individuals because they get more support and so I take my anger out by bullying and dehumanizing them online.  I'm always looking to start fights with anybody online and this has affected a number of my online relationships.  I'm not proud of this whatsoever obviously but I still fucking do it.

pimppapy,How do I (40’sM) reach her (13F) before she makes an attempt?,2,1c500y3,0,"My daughter has mild autism (high functioning). She is most like me in almost all the ways possible. I was personally taught, through religion, that suicide is a one way ticket to hell etc. when I was younger than her. For me I always had that to fall back on whenever the invasive thoughts made me consider ending it all. 


But as I got older, got an education in STEM and seeing reality for what it is, I ended up leaning towards agnosticism, so I lost the fear of hell. But simultaneously I had my kids, and the internet to teach me and fully understand that suicide is a selfish action. No parent should have to bury their child and at the same time no child should lose their parent to it. Because of that I see my own parents and children as my anchors and no matter how depressed I feel or how hard I want it to end, I’ve resigned myself to suffering in silence until it just happens naturally. One of the many curses of having this much empathy I guess. 


But now my daughters therapist is telling us her concerns on how she should not be left alone, needs to be distracted etc. but it’s not possible to be on top of her 24/7. We also feel when she notices the overbearingness of us, her parents, that it’ll cause another issue. 


She doesn’t open up to me the way she does with her therapist, nor as much as she does with her mom. But ironically, her mom only knows what’s she is told and has had no first hand experience with what she/I are going though. I feel like I made a mistake in not pushing them towards religion, even though I stopped pursuing it myself due to other issues that being in that community caused, that I didn’t want my kids to go through.

My dad is currently on probation, so I'm not sure if it's his, because he's not legally allowed to own a gun.

I don't know where the ammo is, though. I'll have to search around for that (unless the gun's already kept loaded). I think this is my chance, my chance to end my subhuman existence once and for all.

vampiregirlsalsa,"I’m only 18, but death feels inevitable at this point",1,1c52z4v,4,"
I (f18) have been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was about 14 years old. Of course, being a logical person, I always chalked it up to a combination of teenage hormones with a bad family situation I’ve been in for my entire life. I’ll explain, for context. I’ve been living with my single mother for years, and we have never gotten along. She’s always told me it was on me, since I’ve been manipulative since I was about eight years old and I’ve been antagonizing her since then, according to her. I have always found this confusing, since I don’t remember ever making the conscious decision to do that to her, but maybe I did. I resorted to trying to be academically great to satisfy her, since she just believes Im a bad person, and it’s worked for the most part, she gets off my back, but then she’ll have a moment every week where she reminds me the only thing in good for is school. I believe her now, I don’t see what else I have to offer anyone really. I’ve been told I’m pretty and according to all my professors I show promise, but beauty fades and what good is intelligence or promise if you are bound to be alone forever? Our fights can get pretty ugly, we both say things that are hurtful, she’ll apologize the next week and buy me things to make up for it. Then, the next time we argue, she’ll throw it in my face that she’s always taken care of me and bought me things and I’m ungrateful. She tried to choke me once and almost did, that’s the only time I’ve ever been scared of her. She thinks I don’t care about her or anything in my life, that I’m this nonchalant person, but that’s only because I don’t have the energy to argue with her anymore. I care about her opinions too much, if she thinks I’m a disappointment at any point, it’ll send me into a spiral, and I’ll do anything to get in her good graces. She’s always been very judgemental on others looks so I developed a bad ED when I was 14-16, hoping she’d notice I was making an effort, that almost got me hospitalized. I take everything she does to heart because she’s kind to everyone else in her workplace or the family. I know she can be good to me as well because we have good moments, which makes me feel guilty for making her out to be such a monster but, the entire thing is just a big blob of mental turmoil I’ve been living in for 18 years. It feels pathetic and I feel stuck in this loop where I want her approval and I hate myself for wanting it, then I realize there is probably a lot of truth to what she says when she’s angry and I won’t want to get do anything for days. This leads to me thinking about suicide for extended periods of time . Usually, these episodes will take place for a week at most and then I’ll manage to lift my spirits. However, recently I noticed that no matter how much time goes by, I always come back to this thought.

Other people have it worse, my mom says there’s moms out there that have beaten and killed their children, I know this is true as well, I just feel stuck. I have a completely debilitating sense of dread for the future and my ability to live on for 50 more years or however long it takes for me to go, life seems to lack so much of the luster it had when I was a kid. I don’t even know if I want to keep trying to go on for that many years if I’m never gonna get rid of this feeling or have anyone that I can feel lighter around. Hopefully in the next year or two I can muster up the courage to go through with it, I’m thinking of an overdose, but I want to do it before I turn 21, I don’t want to go on that long.

seahawkspwn,How am I supposed to love myself when my friends and loved ones have burned me so many times?,2,1c4xjyd,0,"I'm just so sad. I try so hard to make meaningful connections and friendships and keep in touch with people without being a burden.

Very rarely do people reach out to me. The ones I call and are aware of my problems seem to think everything is kosher and they don't need to ever check on me after I've told them that I literally want to be not around.

They gaslight me when I say I want to have a higher bar for my relationships. For people to even put in half of what I feel like I do into my friendships would be wonderful. 

I went to a ""good friends"" wedding on the other side of the country in October. He has been in my city without hitting me up and hadnt seen me in like 5 years before I flew in for his wedding (since he graduated college a year ahead). 

My date, who I foolishly told everyone I'd marry someday, took away that the married couple looked happier than us and that we shouldn't be together.

 My friend who got married and his best man were friends a year ahead of me and I met both of them my freshman year of college. They treated me well but it was clear I was always below their friendship and in recent years they've gotten together to watch college basketball once a year in a conference tournament of their choice in March. 

For years I've just wanted to be a part of that or anything that will let us catch up and while they say they are my friend, that apparently is too sacred of a tradition to include me in beyond this pity year. They bought Tix to the games without me, hotel without me, and so I only sat near them a couple games the 3 days I was there out of 5 and had to get an Airbnb.

 I drove them all around and we had a good time, aside from the one night they got tipsy and started arguing so I left for my Airbnb to not get in the middle.

My grandpa is dying, my parents aren't here, my relationship has left me shattered, my therapist keeps having a reason to reschedule me. The friends I try to make in my city don't seem to care about me and will never initiate conversation. Rarely want to do things. Girls will take my number or chat with me for a day and then ghost. I'm not even that ugly, why am I so undesirable and disposable?

Why am I not enough. I'm so kind, I'm funny, I'm smart, I'm open minded and willing to do different things.

For the life of me I can't seem to hold down a friend who doesn't eventually decide they don't need me. I still think about these people. Nobody from my past ever reaches out to me to see how I'm doing. Whether it's ex coworkers I was friends with at work or other college buddies or whatever, I don't cross anyone's mind.

I wish I just was never born. My whole life I've felt this loneliness and I've tried to fill it however I can but the hole keeps getting bigger and bigger.

I can't stop thinking about how I'd do it. I just want the emotional scars to heal. I just want people to want me for me.",1713215093.0,
Mean-Ball-8758,"A bad subliminal made me almost kill myself (subliminal users please help, but ofc anyone can respond)",1,1c52rwn,0,"Hello, so idk my story may be a little different from like a normal suicidal thing. Not in the way of like “oh im better my storys worse”. No, in fact i think my story is plenty stupid to most people. I listened to a negative subliminal, and i wished a multitude of things. I wished to be pretty, i wished to be smarter, i wished for me and the people i cared about to die of old age and no longer be suicidal and start to heal. 

And not only that i wished specific stuff on ways to heal that were specific to them because i hated seeing everyone around me suffer. Well, turned out, this was an opposite subliminal!!! The opposite of what i wanted to happen, happened! And i wished so many things that realizing this and watching these bad results come to fruition has made me go literally insane!! So of course i did what most subliminal users do and listened to a flush, but it removed a lot of results i wanted-

 so i listened to a permanent results subliminal which brought back old desired results. Wellll i have intrusive thoughts and my fear of getting those results back caused them to not only come back permanently but to loop repeatedly in my mind as the subliminal stated. Now whether or not it truly did loop in my mind doesnt matter, it matters that i believed that it did and my belief in the negativity was so strong that things just got worse from there. My friends problems got so much worse, and i became hated by so many people. My grades slipped fo almost failing, and i became stupid and worst of all my best friend almost committed suicide. I have since been flushing this subliminal and doing desired results subliminals but im always living my life in fear
I constantly felt like i had to die to save everyone and that i had no choices, and i still feel like it will never go away. Im sorry ive said way too much but you know its how ive felt for the entire year. I feel so out of control and i have almost committed suicide myself many times. It doesnt help that i feel like nobody cares because everyone hates me and im all alone sooo idk im sorry lol.

any advice or support anyone can offer would be really appreciated

Adderall used to work when I was younger. It doesn't anymore.

In general without medication I feel so hungry and tired all the time. With medication it makes it worse.  I can't get regular sleep without continuously waking up everyday. I've been feeling so hungry over the past few years. When i complain they test me and my labs come back normal so they just shrug. I'm sorry tried of living. Everyday is so miserable. 

Without my meds I lose everything, get mad, I can't function, I can barely take care of myself. With my meds I feel sick and miserable too.
  I am on duloxetine because it's the only med that doesn't apparently cause weight gain. It kind of works. 

I gained a bunch of weight after starting the depo shot a few years ago because my cramps were debilitating and i would throw up and be unable to walk, and my period is very heavy so i tried to opt out of that experience. 50 pounds later i hate myself so much and i still feel so hungry every day. I have switched to using patches continuously to skip my period but the best part is when i take my adderall i start BREAKTHROUGH BLEEDING and severely cramping. how am i supposed to win???? 

Then the stupid ass doctors just tell me to take ibuprofen, which i can't because it doesn't work as well anymore, and it interacts with duloxetine and Tylenol is just about as useful as my PINKY TOE.


 I've tried so many diets, calorie counting, drinking water, i wake up in the middle of the night hungry. I could eat until I'm so full i can't move but i would STILL BE HUNGRY. Doctors don't know what's wrong with me and don't know why my adderall doesn't work. My A1C and glucose is perfect.

It's gotten to the point where I pretty regularly cry about being hungry no matter how little or how much i eat, and I'm even STARVING ON ADDERALL.

I have been trying so many different doses of fucking every stimulant And i would literally go home from school and work crying and i have been crying in the bathrooms lately. I want my body back and my life and my money i spend it all on food and I struggle in school and work and i just want to function like a normal person.
I get angry doing school work and cry daily so I have just not been showing up, and I have been calling out of work too. I DONT KNOW HOW TO GET A DOCTOR TO TAKE ME SERIOUSLY!!! please help please help I'm so MISERABLE.  

I don't know how to fix myself and be my former self again. I wish i never FUCKING TOOK THE FIRST FUXKING SHOT. I'm literally in tears as I'm reading this right now and yes i SO FUCKING HUNGRY. 
And no, i cannot afford therapy.

Tonight I told my friend I consider like a sister that I wouldn't live till 30.
It's not that I want to die but may be suffering from DID (dissociative personality disorder).
I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder but the diagnosis may evolve cause apparently we misunderstood my symptoms. 
I know there is really little chance I have not DID.
One of my alter already tried to kill our body in the past so I know that I won't have enough control to prevent him to kill our body.
I just don't want him to hurt anyone else. 
I find the situation really ironic cause it's the first time in my life I don't want to die all the time. 
I realize that I want to have the power to decide when it will happen. 
In my country, there's some people that can access medical suicide and I will try to have that. I know that it's a really difficult journey I'm starting but I will do it. Medically or not. 
I don't want to live my life in an hospital or at the asylum. 
I'm scared as hell but i feel peace thinking about that idea. That makes me think it's the good decision. 
It won't happen until a few years so I'll try my best to enjoy life till then.

Conscious-Charge-847,I don’t want to be here anymore,5,1c4p6bk,2,"I’m a 24 year old trans man who is struggling with depression and PTSD. 

I’ve been struggling with chronic depression for more than 10+ years, as young as 12. I’ve been struggling with suicidal ideations and attempts since 13. This is just a vent because I don’t have anyone I can tell this to nor have I ever shared it with anyone. I don’t know what to do at this point, it feels like I’ve tried everything. Nothing excites me, I don’t feel anything towards anyone or anything anymore, and it’s been this way for a while. The only reason I’ve stayed alive for as long as I have is because of one thing- which was to get my dream job so that I could help others with my own life experiences. I worked towards this goal throughout high school and college- even now I am enrolled in a master’s program to further my skills for his job. I got promoted to this position last year and went through a 6 month academy and a 2 month training program to get to the final field training program that lasts 4 months. I’m about halfway through the program and I noticed the entire time, I’ve been experiencing nothing but back to back extreme depressive episodes and I don’t know why. The one thing I worked towards to stay here is just not what I was expecting or it didn’t bring me the happiness I thought it would. I feel like a burden to everyone around me, that they would be better off without me around having to clean up my messes. I keep fucking up at my job and making it worse. I don’t have anyone in my life to talk to or would care if I was gone. Other than this job, I have nothing. I feel angry, upset, and tired all the time. I’ve lost at least 10 pounds from the stress I’ve been putting myself under the last few months. I even had a breakdown at a re-certification training for firearms because I was fucking up my qualification so bad in front of everyone along with all the stress I’ve been under- I’ve never cried in front of people, so it was embarrassing and humiliating. Everyone around me is just happy all the time with a great support system, and I feel like I will never achieve that, no matter how hard I try or how bad I want it. I don’t think I can do this for another 30 years, constantly feeling depressed, lonely, and angry all the time- it’s just not worth it anymore. The depression and PTSD is too much for me and I just can’t handle it anymore nor do I want to. I’m sure I would just be doing everyone a service if I just killed myself. With this job, I have access to a firearm now that makes it relatively painless for my to kill myself versus other methods I’ve tried in the past. Since I probably won’t pass this program, I’ve given myself to the end of June to get everything together to make it easier for people to clean up when I’m gone. Anytime I try and reach out for help, I get the same cookie-cutter answers of just ‘eat healthy’ and ‘do hobbies,’ making it seem like depression is just something you can snap out of. Whenever I get answers like that it just makes me feel more angry, like no one truly understands how crippling and disabling it is to be like this all the time. If it were that easy, I would have done it but it’s not. All I feel like doing is sleeping and doing the bare minimum to get life essentials done. I’m too fatigued to care about anything else- sleep is the only time I can get my mind to turn off when I don’t have nightmares. 
 At this point, this post is just a vent, so feel free to scroll. If anyone has had similar experiences or advice on similar situations I would appreciate it- maybe feel less alone.",1713195197.0,

Since January, my mental health has steadily declined, after experiencing loss of my grandpa and seeing his corpse, doing stressful internship for a month, last year, experiencing earthquake at the start of the year, I started having extreme health anxiety and physical symptoms, going to multiple doctors and ERs, having no friends except for my long distance boyfriend, meeting him for the first time in February then having to leave him at the airport which further traumatized me.

 Then leaving my moms house for the first time and moving to a new place triggered anxiety and stress like I’ve never experienced before, I started getting weak muscles, dry mouth, skin and eyes, insomnia. I have started my first adult job in April, working nine to six, and only realizing they will be making me work night shifts and day shifts alternating and with long hours. Which made me realized I made a mistake and I don’t want to work for this company in this position. Ever since moving and starting this job I would start crying almost every day, feeling nauseous, my skin and mouth feel dry and I get headaches. 

Yesterday when I realized that I can’t handle working at this company and that I made a big mistake agreeing to work here, I thought of how stupid and worthless I was and I started crying unconditionally in public, tears streaming down my face as I walked home, feeling like there were weights on my legs. I wanted to collapse to the ground right then and there. When I got home I had a mental breakdown, thought I was going to kill myself, I felt so scared and felt so unsafe. I started screaming and beating my fists against the wall until my hand hurt. I called in sick today for work and they are planning on making me move for work on the 18th to a different location and stay at a hotel to do some kind of speech in front of an audience. I don’t think I am in the physical or mental state to do so. 

But my family tells me to not quit and stick out the first three months but I do not feel safe anymore and everyday I am distracted by my physical symptoms, I feel so lost as to what to do, if I quit this job I will have nothing to show for, I will be unemployed for life.

I see other people who are securely attached and I would wish I had family that loved and supported me.

I had a bad time in 2021. I tried to kill myself in August and I spent a month in hospital instead. My best friend babysat me after I got out for a whole month. I lost him because of that. It was too much for him. I was too much. I am grateful to him because I would have never bounced back the way I did if he hadn't, but I miss him *so* much my heart hurts. I wish he would have told me because I didn't know that letting him help me would cost me someone who had been my best friend for 8 years.

I don't think I'm a good person. I think I try really hard to be, but because of my childhood and my traumas, I can't be.

I was doing okay enough before 2021. I still struggled with undiagnosed ADHD, depression, and other traumas. My anxious avoidant attachment style still showed up in all the worst places of my life.

But I hadn't burnt out entirely until 2021.

It was the year of my biggest heartbreaks. I broke up with my 3 year boyfriend, only to have 2 of my best friends profess feelings, and ultimately lose both of them. The relationship was toxic. I wish I had learnt boundaries back then, because I didn't want to date until October. 

But I was scared to lose them as people. I thought they were more important than I was. I always thought everyone else was more important than I was.

I have so much unhealthy hard wiring to undo if I'm to ever be happy in my life. 

I push everyone out of my life without even meaning to.

I don't know how to love, but I want to be loved so badly.

I never date the right people. I always date people that make me worse, because it's familiar. I keep finding a home in people who hurt me because that's what I know.

I have no family, and I keep my friends at an inappropriate distance. There is nobody to help me anymore.

I used to be bright and positive, and I made the wrong choices, trusted the wrong people, and I'm broken now. 

Usually when a person gets to this state in their lives, they go back home to family to heal. When someone is very ill, they go back to close people to be taken care of.

I have nobody to take care of me, and I'm tired. I can't do this alone, and I am alone. You are all strangers on the internet. I want to be picked up off the floor and reminded that I'm loved.

I don't even want pity so I don't know why people keep accusing me of using pity to get sex or relationships. I never got it as a child so why would I get it now?  
  
I don't see what the point in living is. I've always been useless and talentless. And nobody will admit it. I guarantee you if I show you some of my hobbies, you'll laugh at how amateur they were, and I'm 27 years old. Worst of all is nobody is offering me hope or a solution to this. I'm bullied by my housemates and carers. My family can't do anything about this situation. I'm not allowed any animals. I feel lonely and lost. I just want to fucking die. I can't stand this anymore.",1713212160.0,
mentlhealth,Apr 15th 2024,1,1c51t5g,0,"Ughh I hated today so much. Yesterday I worked from 11 pm to 4 am on writing the script for the video with like 2 30 min breaks which I used to play ff7. When I woke up this morning I was insanely tired because I had to go to school at 8 am but I just went ahead and got my mom to take me to school. In school all I did was draw and read some pages of ""Norwegian Wood"". It was pretty uneventful up until the 3rd class, in my 3rd class a girl fainted and we had to leave the class room and because after the 3rd class we have a 30 min lunch break most of the students from my class went ahead to go get lunch. I saw a group of around 10 kids who make fun of me go down the stairs and heard them laughing because the girl had fainted which sort of solidified the idea in my mind that I wasn't crazy and most of my classmates were genuinely horrible people. Even though my 3rd class was canceled because of the fainting incident I still decided to wait until the bell rang to go get some food. I usually don't eat on my lunch breaks because I use the money which my parents give me for other things such as; books, games or even hanging out with my friends, but this time I had decided to just get some food as I was feeling particularly hungry. I ate a pizza slice and a donut and sat on a short knee high concrete wall which was in the yard of my school as I read a bit of my book. I then headed to class and as soon as I knew it my classes had ended and I had to go home. While I was in school I had a very silly thought in which I sort of compared myself to Sisyphus. I did this because I realized thaf my life had become a constant cycle of waking up tired, going to school, writing things down in school, wishing I qas home, getting home and then writing at home till 2 am each night. This realization made me sad but I decided that I had to have this sort of a monotonous life as the end result would be a video of which I would truly be proud. I got home and talked with my sister for a bit before laying in bed and scrolling instagram. This however was a mistake as I fell asleep and lost about 2 and a half hours of my day. Ultimately this wouldn't have really mattered anyway as I ended up not doing any work today. Me not being productive genuinely made me take a hit to my mental health as one of the only things which is still keeping me going is the feeling I get when I'm actually productive. At like 12 am my mom kept coming into my room and arguing with me about going to sleep so I promptly kept trying to convince her to let me stay. This seemed to work as she left my room, but alas she came back around 30 minutes later and this time told me that tomorrow she would have both my internet and the houses internet turned off so that I can't use my pc. I of course had to argue with her at 12:30 but she was being childish so I decided to just leave her alone as I realized she wouldn't listen to me no matter how hard I tried. My mom has always sort of acted like a toddler, not really listening to reason or admiting that shes wrong, she constantly lies but absolutely hates it when I use the word ""lie"" for her this word is on the same level as saying a swear word infront of her or something. Of course her childish behavior has made me lose any respect I ever had for her which makes her really mad. I find it funny that my mom never takes accountability for mentally abusing me and then she keeps pestering me to do things like clean my room or study when I'm not able to do that because of this great hole of depression which I reside in. Sometimes she'll decide that she wants to try being a good parent and ask me whats wrong but whenever that happens I of course always tell her that it's all alright and that I'm doing well when I clearly am not. This is because everytime I've told her about a serious issue I have in my life (i.e me having suicidal thoughts or me getting bullied in school) she always seems to understand and be genuinely sorry for what I've gone through but later down the line she uses these things against me. For instance we were having an argument once and she told me somthing along the lines ""what? You want to kill yourself? Well then go ahead and do it"". This happpens quite often and I get very depressed when it does, that's why I've decided to stop talking to her about my problems. This has also made me unable to truly vent to a person, so much so that I have to use a burner on reddit to post what are essentially diary entries for the whole world to see just because I think a account without anything linkekd to it is safer than actually talking to one of my friends or something. But in my defense I recently had a friend tell me something that genuinely crushed my soul. So much so that I stopped talking and moving for 10 minutes after he siad it and just sat there crying my eyes out in a hysterical manner. This happened through discord so I promptly muted myself so they couldn't hear my weeping and so they had no idea what was going on. This also happened infront of my crush which made things even worse as she sort of kinda agreed with what he said. Now let me explain what happened. Me, my crush and 2 other friends were in a discord call together as usual. Me and my crush were talking and she said that I'm literally like some character from a video game ( i can't remember which character cause I sort of disassociated after what happened). I proptly said that this character in fact wasn't like me but instead that I thought that another character was more simillar to me. (Now I won't specify which character but at least I'll mention that he's froma book. I also want to mention that this character isn't really a good one as he has a lot of sexual thoughts, is very depressed and sometimes misogynistic. Now let me get this clear I don't relate to the misogyny part as this aspect of him is only present when he is in a way more horrible mental state than anyone could ever imagine and while I might not relate to the misogyny in every other aspect he is exactly like me. Same thoughts, same speech patterns, same level of depression, same everything basically.) I want to mention that at the time and still to this day I have never fully opened up to someone, not my crush, not my friends and definitely not my parents, so basically nobody knows the real me; What I think about, how I act, how my life is going and how my relationship with my pparents is, are all aspects of me which not a single person on this world (except for myself and you who are reading this) knows about. When I mentioned this character she replied in a sort of disgust ""Well that might not be the best person to compare yourself to"" this is because she doesn't like the character for who he is, this is fine but she hasn't even read the entire book so she doesn't know about the development this character experiences. I would've liked to reply with ""Well not you nor anyone here knows how I think so I'm not sure if judging me like that is alright but ok"" but I didn't say this as I didn't want her perception of me to change from someone who is a bit silly to someone who hides who they really are from others. In this moment my friend who I'll call Jhon asked us who the character that I was comparing myself to was since he had heard me and my crush talking about this book on numerous occasions. He decided to google it and after reading what the book was about he said ""So this is who you've been pretending as to and looking up at your entire life?"" That sentence was one of the most soul crushing sentences I've heard in my entire life. After he said this my crush said ""Jesus man you didn't have to say it like that"" in a sort of neutral tone which in my mind represents that everyone around me was thinking the exact same thing. I went silent and proceeded to mute my microphone and weep profusely at what was just said. Now I understand that you might not really get why I would cry at this and its very simple, this whole thing was spoken in a different language and so I've tried to translate it as close as I can but there just really isn't a correct way to say it with 100% accuracy. Now this made me sad because with that sentence he made me belive that basically all of my emotions and everything I went through in my entire life was all just a farce. The things which I belived made me a sad and somber man with no will to live was juust me overreacting and being overly emotional. This sentence made me think that everyone thought of me this way, as some guy who was trying to act sad but truly wasn't. I had realized at that moment that truly nobody in the whole world knew what I went through, rhey didn't know about the heart breaks, the pain, the emotional and mental scars which I had aquired throughout my life. They didn't know about any of it and though I was just someone who acted sad because he though it was cool but in reality was genuinely happy. This of course isn't the truth and is a memory which continues to haunt my soul and I think about it almost every time I talk to any of my friends. I'm sorry for writing this late but I didn't think I would have anything to write about today until me and .my mom had an argument. Yesterday I reposted my original post about my life and mental state but not a single soul saw it, and so I've decided to post this one as well.  Maybe this one will be seen and I'll finally get some help and confort for what I've gone through.",1713225689.0,

I have been like this for so long i really dont think it gets better and im always going to be struggling with the same stuff all i do is rot in my room, therapy and antidepressants arent even helping me at all i just want to completely give up and disapear i dont want to deal with any of this i dont want to be a person. i only have one friend in school and THEY ALSO want to kill themselves and literally in the same hole as me. i hate everyone and everything i don't want to do this i dont want to ""fix"" myself its too hard id rather kill myself.",1713225131.0,

My brother is severely autistic and has a breakdown over the slightest thing or if things aren't done his way I know he can't help it I know he needs the support but I can't keep doing it being the only person he'll interact with or listen to isn't something I want for him I want to help him so damn bad and to an extent I can because I know how to deal with mental health from working in care but it's exhausting.

My other brother had pretty severe issues and also autism though not on the same level as the first brother but it's to the point that he has been kicked out of school just before his final exams and spends all his time around idiots who do nothing but drink and smoke.

My sister is pretty normal but recently she's refused to eat and literally lives on something like a packet of noodles a day, I want to make it clear that she isn't fat or even overweight.

My mother only cares about the money people can give her, if you give her money she's your best friend but the second you don't she's the worst person you'll ever meet, she also doesn't know how to handle any of those 3 kids or maybe she just doesn't care enough because she thinks screaming and arguing with an autistic 17 year old is a good idea just because he hasn't left his room instead of giving him a reason to actually leave it.

And then ME who genuinely can't take it anymore I think they'd all be better off is I was gone I have no friends or family members I can talk to, I have no future dealing with those 4 I've spent my life trying to make them happy and all I seem to do is complain to them hoping they listen. I hate myself as it is everything from my teeth to my toenails it genuinely makes me feel sick if I see myself in a mirror, thing is I workout a LOT because it's the only place I can go to get away from it besides work I'm not fat have abs decent arms but it all makes me sick.

Anyway I'll be gone soon anyway if not self inflicted probably due to something like sepsis from a tooth that I genuinely just don't have time to get dealt with I work throgh the day 7 days a week, go to the gym at night and every other second is spent dealing with some issue that happened to come up out of nowhere involving one of those people. 

I don't know the point of this post not like anyone can actually do anything besides tell me to get away, like I haven't tried but I genuinely can't say no to those kids.

Oh and if you are wondering why this is posted in here I have everything planned for the 1st of next month, what I'm going to do, the time,place, will is written everything is set up. Though like I said before it wouldn't surprise me if I died from something else before that date.

yestermorrowposting,Everytime I almost make things better I mess it up and it's worse,2,1c4v8hv,0,"Had decided I was willing to go back to Amazon because my little fast food job I took two years ago just to have a job to get out of living in a hotel is not cutting it anymore. I'm tired of working so hard to make so little. I found a shift that pays five dollars an hour more than what I make now, had more hours and yet more days off. I had recently found out my insurance through work doesn't cover some things that are very important to me (I am a transgender man and have been paying out of pocket for testosterone for years) and the Amazon job would have covered it and more.

 I'd done the math, $950 a month more than I make now. Enough for a dental bridge. I had 7 teeth surgically removed due to dental neglect as a kid and grinding my teeth. I have tmjd which causes my jaw to do all sorts of painful things. I need the bridge. I applied for care credit specifically because I would have been able to afford the payments with my new job.

Then the day came to go in and turn in my i9 documents and I couldn't find my social security card anywhere so I missed the appointment. It was too late to reschedule and they've removed me as a candidate for that position. 

You have to understand this is a shitty thing on top of a huge pile of shit that is my life. And now because I lost this job opportunity and I'm so poor I have to cancel the only fun thing I had in my future because I won't be able to afford it. 

I have absolutely nothing left and at this point I'm holding on just to hold on. I've started calling out of work on days I'm too depressed to go in which doesn't help my income. I got really excited over this new job and now i feel stupid for having had hope.

Jolly_Ad626,I think it's finally time,2,1c4txkj,3,"I just wanted to leave this here.. because I'm not telling anyone and I'm not leaving a note. I'll just leave this here and it's all I even have the energy to say...

My life has been riddled with childhood abuse, relationship abuse, mental illness and even single time I make progress... I literally lose everything.

I had a baby 7 years ago. I took care if her 247. She went to ever doc appointment. Never a rash. Never a bruise. Never a scratch. Hit every growth goal. Extremely healthy..  I was depressed while I was pregnant. The father tried to strangle me and kill me when he found out I was pregnant... then he left and when she was born caused nothing but he'll in my life. So I had to take welbutrin because I would have killed myself 100 percent without it. 

Well when I had her I went to a psych and got on the meds  I needed. I was drowsy and fell asleep late one night watching TV after I tucked her into bed and my brother heard her crying before I did. So they called cps. Cps couldn't do anything at all bc nothing had been done wrong! I did everything to take perfect care if her.. so my mother kicked me out while cps was there and I had nowhere to go   they told me since I no longer had a place to live, she'd go to foster care or I'd have to adopt her out.. hearing the foster system.horror stories I adopted my perfectly healthy, beautiful child who I loved more than anything in this world. The woman said I could visit her whenever but as soon as u tried she threatened to say I was attempting kidnap which literally broke me completely.  I was left with no baby. No home. No family     after that I got on heroin. I couldn't cope. I eventually got clean and to this day I'm sober...

Yet since being sober I've realized all the horrible things that have happened to me. 
I have been raped. Forced to watch someone being raped.. waterborne. Stalked. Arms beaten so badly I could not move them. Hands so bruised I couldn't work. Black eyes.  Strangled until i passed out several times. 

And then finally when I think my life is getting back on track... my fiance tells me I am the worst thing to ever happen to him and that I ruined his life. How? He cannot tell me. 

This is a sick place full of sick people and I simply won't tolerate it for another day. I wish everyone the best.. please don't abuse people. Please don't scheme on people. Love your children.. it matters so much... im getting a helium tank today and going quietly in the woods. I dont want anyone to find me. I have been hurt abd wringed everybturn of the way.

My drunk mom would sometimes argue and escalate to the point of her suckerpunching me and calling the cops but couch surfing is cool and I eventually ended up living with my grandma. Highschool was easy, very anxiety inducing but not much to complain about. Got bullied for being gay in elementary school but never in highschool. By the end of it I got a No Child Left Behind full ride scholarship to a good school in my town. 
Then one of my friends died. We talked and cuddled occasionally and I had accidentally outed him by telling one of my friends out of excitement. He had told me about him cutting himself and suicidal ideation and I tried to talk him out of it as much as I could before I told a counselor. He got a girlfriend and we drifted apart before someone came up to me one day to tell me he drowned on his own vomit in his sleep. 
It broke me but I was about to graduate so I tried to keep going.  One day my grandma started arguing with painters outside her door and I started arguing with her because they were doing their jobs. It escalated to the point where I punched a filing cabinet and pushed her over. I went back to couch surfing after that. I started taking whole bottles worth of lithium and whatever I had and fell asleep. I'd always just throw it up and never tell anyone. Then she died of cancer and I never said goodbye.
I'm living on my own now. No friends. I insulted a man who I'd dream about dating in highschool just because he didn't talk to me. I don't have to feel bad about someone finding my body anymore. I have no goals or aspirations. I have to dissociate to get through anything outside out of anxiety. I hate everything about this life.

I have this painful feeling, like I have been done dirty. Like this is a mean joke played on me.

I see other people. Many of them. Young too. They drive expensive cars, buy beautiful stuff and have no care about anything. I do not necessarily envy them, but when I look at myself compared to them, I feel so insignificant, despite all my intelligence and reasoning. I feel like I am lower than them, in a way.

My family is not poor, but it is not rich either. I had no choice but to be born in it. My parents also have this unexplainable desire to not progress in life, this has hindered them a lot, and as much as I have tried to change that for the better, it did not change much. I feel like I have been given a bad and unfair start at life. I know other people may have that too, but this does not make it any more right.

Sometimes, this feeling brings rage, but other times, the more intense ones, it brings deep sadness and I completely crash. It all seems so pointless to me. My life feels like it was made for me to lose and suffer for it. 

I try to fight it, and I try to work really really hard.

I am planning on dying sometime in the near future if things go to plan, just have to order the nitrogen gas to do it. It will be painless if done correctly and I will finally be gone.

Here are some of the basics about me. I have been sick for most my life; mental illness, chronic conditions, incurable stuff ya know. I am not the brightest tool in the shed, in fact, I don't even believe I really even shine. Perhaps if I was smarter this wouldn't be my only option, but I am not, and I am too tired to do anything about it other than this as it is the most simple solution. I am not beautiful either, and I know the biggest rebuttal to that is that beauty is all subjective or specific to the beholder, but even then, I am not beautiful as it stands today which is all that matters personally on the subject of beauty for myself. I don't believe in God, though I was raised up Christian but after a particularly close call with death and a couple of other things, I personally have decided for myself that I don't believe God exists. My favorite color is blue and my favorite food depends on the day but I usually hover around sushi or chicken.

I don't want this post to upset anyone, I just felt the need to say goodbye to someone, to pretend for a minute. If it's any consolation, I lived a relatively happy life, in fact, I would consider my very early childhood years as the happiest years in my life, things have of course changed since then, but I do have happy memories. I have been remising on good memories from when I was young as well recently, and those have provided me quite a bit of comfort throughout all of this, so just know that I won't be sad either. I feel at peace with all of this, in fact, I feel really relieved that my life will finally end. I am not nervous or scared, just content. It is almost as if I am floating in my emotions, not quite settling on one or the other, but just hovering above them.

Tbh I don’t think I should even feel this way when my life has been fine, But I just lose motivation. I “tried” to kill myself, but I knew it would fail. I tried in a high failure attempt of suicide like strangling my self, suffocating myself with a pillow. I was well aware I couldn’t do it, I knew my body would automatically react on its own even if I tried, cause I was scared , scared to die, but mostly scared at what me dying will do to everyone I love.

I gave so much of myself to someone just for my feelings to be tossed around and trashed like it didn’t matter, I made the first mistake, I was so stupid, dense, and ignorant, I’ve hurt them accidentally but I was willing to change and learn, so why did you have to be like that.

secretbackroomdoor,sex (or my lack thereof) makes me want to die so fucking bad,42,1c49ryv,23,"i figure i should put a warning for a few mentions of rape and grooming, so... yeah. also, i really do not want to offend anyone with the things i say. that is not my intention. i'm just in a dark place. hopefully i worded everything in a way that makes sense.

i'm a 17 year old girl. and i'm getting so desperate for help and answers from real people that i'm \*attempting\* to swallow my anxiety and post this. i'm near terrified to do so, let's just hope i don't delete this in a fit of panic!!

anyways, to put it simply, i'm a messed up person, and i don't have (much of) a clue as to why. i want to be desired sexually so terribly bad that i find myself bursting into a fit of tears and anger at any mention of sex, and the like. like, just thinking about it makes me cry because of how much i know i'm missing out on.

i can't consume much, if any content at all about it. i avoid it like the plague, yet i'm addicted to masturbation. it's my only solace. and since i'm near constantly stressing about it, it makes the experience much less enjoyable than i know it could be. the way sex makes me feel is driving me insane and i feel terrible about it because i even go as far as to get jealous of people who have been groomed or raped.

a good person doesn't feel like that. why am i so messed up? a regular person doesn't feel so much pain over something like this that they would rather die than have to feel it.

i don't know what's wrong with me. absolutely \*\*nothing\*\* traumatic has ever happened to me to warrant such an intense reaction, yet here i am, sobbing because of how badly i wish to be desired. to have that kind of attention. it doesn't matter who it's from anymore. i often find myself fantasizing about really terrible things that i don't want to admit. and i'll be honest in saying often, i even prefer it over the regular fantasies.

there is much much more i could say, as i have a plethora of issues, including more tied to this but i don't want to make this too lengthy. if anyone ends up reading this and commenting, i'll try to answer. i understand that i likely need some form of therapy, but i am far too afraid of asking my parents, so i've just been stuck feeling like this pretty much all alone. i don't know what to do, please, somebody just understand or help. because i don't even really understand myself.

I am 15f if you don't know already. This is a sorta aftermath of the A & E. I had lied to my parents about what the actual attempt was about, and just said it was an accident. That's all fine and dandy, but the part I'm dreadful about is therapy.

I want to say what I was actually doing, and why I actually did it since I know it's the only way to get treatment but I don't want to get thrown into a ward (I have attempted 3 times throughout my life. Once when I was 10, another when I was 11, and one at my current age of 15). I am contemplating suicide again, I genuinely don't want to live anymore, I've had enough of my existence but if I tell my therapist I actually tried to commit suicide and probably plan to do it again, I'm afraid I'd get thrown into a child's ward.

M25

I've been struggling pretty significantly these past 3 years. Currently medicated, weaned off my old meds (Paroxetine) into a new one (Anafranil). It sucked, I tell ya. What I've dealt with, is agoraphobia, depression, anxiety and OCD. My psychologist wants to go further with my diagnoses, she suspects autism, personality disorder or aspergers.   


Problem is, I cannot in my current state of anxiety even show up to actually get blood work, EKG or show up to appointments. My doctor (he works together with my psych.) prescribed Oxazepam, but I'm so deathly afraid of it. 

To not make it long, life has basically fucking sucked. A lot of medical emergencies and deaths in my family. Uncontrollable thoughts and rituals that will make me horrendously anxious if I do not do them. Dissociation, making things not seem real, endlessly a feedback loop to fuel my anxiety and panic. A failure, a family stain, someone who's weird, that guy that people says are ""Nice"" but I'm so fucking awkward. Rotting alone in my apartment, grasping to even have something, just SOMETHING to look forward to, trying so damn hard to have a consistent schedule. But for what?  


The hatred I have for myself is out of control. My biggest enemy is myself, and I struggle to turn it around. Like, anything I fucking do, it does not matter, it'll be met with negativity and no praise, even the difficult hurdles. I try man... I try so fucking hard to not let things consume me, but I just have a feeling that I'm losing control. I've sincerely tried to turn things around. To have a schedule, to move myself, to change, to attend appointments, to conquer my fears, to meditate, to have a diary, to read self-help books, to listen to music, to look out the window, to get fresh air, to fucking end this illusion of danger, that my mind instates. I just cannot take it anymore. I want to feel real. I want to get out. I want to eat. I want to experience. I want to love. I want to experience life. I want to live. Please.

&#x200B;

I've really struggled to see what good would be on the other side. Working tirelessly and thanklessly at a job that probably drains my health even further? I really wanted to work with music, but anything creative is even more dead-end. At best a hobby on the side. Who'd even listen to the bullshit I even make? I've spent 10 years, and I've got nothing to show for it. I just want to live life. Not be a fucking cog in the system.  


I've tried to end my life before. It failed, as I puked the medicine up. I will spare you the details. Suicide note prepped too.  


To everyone on this subreddit; Life is not fair, and will never be fair. That does not mean you're not entitled to experience love, warmth, security. Try to be better to yourself. Kind of ironic I say this when I obviously could not, but it's a genuine request. I was not strong enough, and that's okay! Really, from the bottom of my heart, try. Exhaust every resource you have. It's okay to be egotistical, you're struggling after all. 

&#x200B;

I think my biggest regret is seeing my mom trying her best to help me. No mother should ever see their child fall as far down as I have. She doesn't deserve it at all. My parents are really trying their best. I just cannot shake the feeling of being a leech, a fucking greedy pig, that takes and takes and takes. It makes me nauseous, that I, a 25-year old man cannot even fucking look after myself. It's so pathetic, so dehumanizing. I wish things would've turned out better. My siblings too.

I am 17, i turn 18 in july though i dont think ill last till then. when i was 7ish, my older sister who is 6 years older than me, would bribe me into having sex(?) with her, for example if i pleased her i would be allowed to play her 3ds. i dont want to get into detail over what we did because it makes me uncomfortable speaking about it, but i will say that she would reenact lesbian p*rn with me. my sister had an addiction to p*rn i think, i remember she would make me watch it with her before what we did, so she must’ve gotten a lot of ideas and wanted real action i suppose. this has led me to be more suicidal over the years because she acts like nothing has happened.
the reason i dont know if this is bad is because i never objected against her at all, so i dont think i have the right to hold this against her, even if it has traumatised me now. this lasted till i was 11-12 i think, which was just then how i started realising how crazy it was. i started becoming conscious of my body incase she would ever try to initiate it again, and i never let people change in the same room as me because i was scared. i dont know why i was scared, i never stopped her. i enjoyed it, so why did i hate changing around people? why did i start to hate my body? 
this stuff keeps me up at night because it makes me realise i have never had a real childhood since i was potentially sa’d by my sister, and i used to be abused by my parents whilst living in poverty.

Sjwameel,Looking for experiences on antidepressants / hormonal disbalans and being honest to surroundings about planning your 'exit' ,5,1c4ktnz,2,"Hey there. This is my first time reaching out on something like this. I've been depressed for some 3 or 4 years now and for the last 1,5 years having suicidal tendencies. To give some what of a background story, it all started 11 years ago when my dad took his own life. Took me 4 years to get back on my feet and in the process did a lot of courses about therapy / burn out recovery / trauma healing. 

A lot of people approached me after I got back up on how I did it and if I could guide them which started my journey as a therapist / healer and I've been helping a lot of people (they say) successfully since. But starting last year I couldn't do it anymore, seeing other people get happy-ish again with their lives while I felt myself sliding down again. So I gave up my practice and moved abroad left behind everything hoping to make a new start. Times have been tough financially, started my own business in entertainment industry and making some good money now but everything still feels shallow, hollow and meaningless. I've never opted for antidepressants cause my dad was on them and it didn't help him nothing so I'm kind of sceptical. 

The season of building festivals is almost starting which means I'll be working from May until September non stop having maybe 2 or 3 days off which is a crazy period but at least I'm busy and I'll make a shitload of money. But until now I haven't been able to enjoy any of it. My best friend who was one of the main reasons getting me on my feet after my dad died, died from an overdose a couple of years back and I just don't feel I have anything left to live for, there is nothing in my life that makes me want to get up in the morning. 

The only little boost I've had until now is that I've decided to end it after the season. Spend my money on a nice place, say my goodbyes and be done with it. If feels like a gigantic relieve and I almost can't wait to be done with it. Because of my mom who is already extremely damaged from my dad's suicide I am willing to give anything a chance until September / October cause I feel like I owe her. Next week I'm visiting my hometown in the Netherlands and I'm gonna be honest to her about my plans cause I don't want her to be surprised by this again. 

I can't imagine anybody taking the time to read until here but if you did thanks that you did. If you have any experience with antidepressants or what I'm suspecting I'm having is a shortage of testosterone or whatever substances. Any experience at all balancing this shit out again would be greatly appreciated. Also people making the same plans and being honest about it to your surroundings please share your experiences. 

PS I'm not looking for any cheer me up messages I have a lot of people and support but it doesn't get thru to me. Also I'm not feeling emotional or dramatic I'm sharing this in a very calm and objective mind. ",1713183677.0,

I’ve wanted to die so many times this last year and I tried and it’s truly the only place and thing left for me, but why does it have to be so hard. I’ve attempted before and don’t want to unless I know I’ll be successful but so much can go wrong . I thought guns were supposed to be easy to get ",1713199573.0,
Fogeythedinosaur,I am falling downhill ,2,1c4qtav,4,"I feel like I'm battling with myself to keep myself alive. The only reason why I haven't taken my own life yet is because I am a coward who keeps failing at it. 

I'm in constant pain, quite literally, suspected arthritis or auto immune disorder but no positive test yet so not sure what is the reasoning. They only want to treat my symptoms which increases my suicidal ideation and doesn't help with my pain at all. The best way for me to explain it is every single joint in my body is inflamed and stabbing me, it's like I have gravity multiplied on me because everything feels heavy. I feel like I struggle to stand as my whole body shakes as it struggles to hold my weight.
 Most days my pain sits at a 7-8, but for the past month or so I've been at a 8-10. It's not getting any better and I've given up on healthcare all together. Despite all of my best efforts so far nothing has decreased the pain, I am only getting worse. 

My health continues to decline, to where now I'm experiencing nausea, moderate food aversion, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue everyday. I feel like I am already dying and I have no support system. 

My partner is a selfish man who only considers his wants and needs. Despite me telling him exactly what I need to feel supported/helped it seems he does the exact opposite. I say I want to live away from the city and he is still looking for homes in the city. 

Before we lived in our current apartment I requested at least a yard, at least a yard our kids can play in. We are now in a second story apartment building. I'm struggling to go up and down the stairs.

I also suspect he thinks I'm pretending, exaggerating, or faking my health issues, despite 4 years of this experience he still downplays and invalidates me. He had a herniated disc that he received surgery for, so of course his pain is more than mine. Of course he is the priority and how dare I struggle to get out of bed in the morning. I'm just a lazy bitch who needs to do more. 

I have no family, my mother died when I was young and everyone else is toxic. They are a family that enables narcissists. So of course I am the bad person for always calling them out for their poor behavior. I'm the root of everyone's problem, I'm the reason my dad's an alcoholic, I'm the reason my brother is poor and still living with dad and becoming/is an alcoholic, I'm the reason my sister is in an abusive relationship, I'm the reason my youngest sister is miserable, I'm the reason for everything bad. Apparently I am a worthless good for nothing that should just roll over and be their doormat. If I don't and request my most basic of boundaries be respected they shit all over it and do what they want anyways. So after years of trying, I cut them off. 

Then there is the state of the world, it doesn't want me living in it. Why do I try so hard to change a world that doesn't want to be changed? Why do I strive to have a better future that I will probably never experience? 

Then the cherry on top of all of this is I have a panic disorder and CPTSD, it's leading to symptoms of agoraphobia. I have bad panic attacks outside, to the point I am gasping for air and getting tunnel vision. I'm not going to be able to be proactive on my own when I can barely walk outside my apartment. 

So I'm rehoming all my pets but my cat, as I know he will actually be taken care of by my partner. I have distanced myself from almost everyone I know. So even if I did have a support system, that died years ago when I stopped reaching out. 

I kept telling myself it's because ""they deserve better"" especially my dog who doesn't get the full activity he deserves. I kept telling myself it's for their best but there's also that little voice that's saying ""you don't deserve them"". That I am not a good enough person to take care of any pets, that I am a shitty terrible owner and they'd all be better off without me. 

I've realized I made a lot of steps towards suicide. I am disassociated and detached from the world. My motivation continually decreases. And my health makes it hard to really want to fight or advocate for myself. 

It's been me taking care of myself for my entire life. I didn't get to have a childhood, I haven't had the ability to just rest and relax and have a normal life. All I have done is suffer, and I just want the suffering to end. And in order for that to happen I have to make a lot of decisions that quite frankly I don't think I have the energy to make. So it just seems much easier to let myself rot, to stop fighting, to stop trying. Because despite how hard I try, despite how much effort I make, I am always in the same spot, crying about something else, and wanting to die. 

Life really isn't worth it if there's nothing but suffering in store for you.",1713199187.0,

DiamondEducational12,I just lost my grandma and my entire family has broken up and my aunt told me my grandma always thought I was a terrible person. I just want to end it,1,1c4w2le,0,"Almost a week ago my grandma died. She was the most important person in my life. 

My cousin moved in to her house a few months before to house sit until she passed. He was supposed to live on the top floor. He changed the whole house. After she passed me and my mom went to her house to just be there and it was completely different. He completely changed her entire house. He threw all her stuff in piles like trash. His dad, my uncle, showed up and I told him his son was a selfish asshole and that he had no right to touch her stuff. 

That night his mom texted me and said that I am a terrible person and that my grandma never liked me. I ended up cutting really badly and I should've gotten stitches but I am afraid of the hospital (I have been cutting since I was 11 and was hospitalized 5 times growing up). Then just all this shit went down and I told my family her words really fucking hurt me and they all said that its fine and its normal part of grieving.

 But im just so done. I hate them all now. The most important thing to me is family and now I dont have one. I just don't want to live anymore. I'm so fucking done.

MirageMasterXS,Finally letting go...,1,1c4vnf9,1,"I don't even know how to start this or even why I'm typing words onto a screen right now. I just know that I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling. I'm tired of hurting. I'm tired of giving. I'm tired of fighting. But most of all, I'm tired of loving too hard and being too much for people in a world that I don't feel like I even fit into anymore.  
I sit here right now, in front of a screen, and all I can think back to is the night of July 6, 2021. That was the last time I fell apart enough to attempt ending the book that tells my story for good. For some reason that I don't understand ... it didn't end that night, no matter how badly I wanted it to and how much I wish it would have.  
Why do I feel that way? Because ever since that night, the only things I've managed to do are push my closest friends and supporters away from me and cause pain in countless people's lives because I'm too broken or stupid to know what to do with my emotions. I know 99% of people won't believe me when I say this, but no one understands the depth of guilt I feel every day for everything that I've done wrong and everyone I've been a burden on or caused problems for. I wish every second of every day that I could take it all back, to a time when I'd never shared my struggles or the deepest parts of myself with anyone. If I could, then no one would ever have been hurt because of me. If I could, then no one would have had to push me away because I caused them problems and discomfort and chaos. It's never been fair to anyone.  
Even if taking it all back would mean that I was completely alone in this life... I would accept that loneliness and personal pain because at least then, the only person who would be feeling any discomfort is me. I'd rather be hurting than ever have anyone else hurting by my words, my actions, or my existence.  
My step-dad committed suicide in 2016, just before Christmas. For a long time, I was angry with him. I couldn't understand the depth of what he was feeling that pushed him to that breaking point and over that threshold. But over the past few years, I've grown to understand. I realize now what must have been on his mind, that sometimes, there are pains inside our minds and weighing on our hearts that are simply too much to overcome or live with. Because that's how I feel now.  
When I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder after my suicide attempt three years ago, I was scared in the moment because even though I had an explanation for why I feel things the way that I do, I also knew that there's no true escape from it. There's no combination of medications, no amount of surgery or treatments, that will ever make the broken parts of my brain work the way that they're supposed to. And that makes me unbearably angry inside, because I don't want to feel the way I do every day. I've been in therapy every week, sometimes every day, since my suicide attempt and I've grown to see my mental health struggles like I do cancer: a beast that even when it's asleep inside, never stays away forever.  
No one on this earth, and no one who's been in my life over the years, deserves to have to deal with the chaotic mess that I am. Someone told me a while back that they couldn't be in the life of someone who causes chaos, and I finally understand what they meant by that. Because I am that someone. I'm so broken and jagged that I can't help but cut anyone who tries to pick me up or hold me close. It's inevitable. And it's why everyone should genuinely hate me and steer clear from me at this point, because I can't stand the thought of hurting anyone else.  
Times like this, I sit here and I ask God, ""Why? Why did I have to be this way?"" I wish I knew the answer to that question. Because if I knew why, then maybe I could have changed it, or at the very least kept myself away from all the people that I eventually hurt and burdened.  
At this point, I'm also wondering why I was born into an era where the world says, ""Handle your own issues, and let everyone else handle theirs."" Being alone is the worst feeling I've known in my entire existence. I thought that it was human nature to want to be around others, to feel included, and to have a group that one can belong to. But, at least according to today's world, that's not the case and I'm an outlier among a sea of people who don't want communication and don't want connection, at least not unless it can do something to benefit them.  
I get that I'm not like 99.9% of the world, that my desire for consistent (not constant, but consistent) communication with those I care about and value isn't how the rest of society is built these days. I get that my depth of caring for others, my depth of feeling in general, is a lot and it's hard for me to put it in the right words, much less for anyone close to me to understand. But I love people, and especially those I let in, because that's how I'm built and it's all I've ever known how to do. I don't like conflict. I can't stand if I cause discomfort or disagreement. I've only ever wanted to love those close to me and be loved for myself in return. But who I am, what I am, and how I am makes that impossible.  
I'm pouring my heart out here and putting it on my sleeve one last time because I know that, after this, I'm never going to again. When being authentic, letting my feelings out, and not hiding behind a mask only creates pain for those around me, then I'm going to keep the armor on. I'm not going to let anything out into the open anymore. That way, even if I am hurting, I'm the only one hurting. That's the best possible scenario.  
I know this is hard for anyone to comprehend, but the depth and intensity of my emotions makes it physically painful when everything falls apart. As I'm typing right now, I feel like there's a hole in my chest, because I'm so overloaded that my heart just ... can't, anymore. I wish I didn't have to feel this way. Everything I've ever experienced, I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy because this ... everything that I feel inside ... is what I imagine hell on earth to be. Maybe it is my own personal circle of hell, because I haven't even gotten to that part ... but I know at my core that I can't possibly be a decent person. Not after the people I've hurt, the chaos I've caused, and the destruction I feel that I've dealt.  
I feel lost in a pit of blackness because even in high school, I never envisioned making it this far. I never thought I'd make it to live as long as I have because even back then, the feelings of emptiness and worthlessness were eating at me. Even then, I never felt like me without the mask was enough for anyone. How can I be ""enough"" for anyone when I'm always too much? When no matter what I do, I only ever overwhelm and destroy the people I let in by the end of it all? Every single one of them, all of you ... you all deserve better than I've ever been.  
I think this is the moment that I've finally lost any hope I might have had in myself that things would be OK. When you try to run from your inner self too long, it always catches you eventually. And it's given me the realization that I'm too broken, too abnormal, and too overwhelming to ever be able to function normally on this earth. The ones that I've let in know that, even if they haven't said it out loud to me.  
That's the only other thing that has weighed on me in all this. Present-day society is such that the easiest course of action is to ghost someone, to swipe on to the next person, or to avoid any sort of communication when one feels uncomfortable instead of caring enough to be honest about things and wanting to try and fix them. I've made every mistake in the book, I feel like. I get it. I'm a bad friend, a bad person to be around, and an emotional weight because of my core self. But even when I've made mistakes, I've wanted to try and make things right. I've wanted to try and not lose friends, not lose connections, because I care about those relationships and they're valuable to me. But I understand now that I value people more than anyone will ever be capable of valuing my level of caring in return. That's not to say that people don't care, but I realize that people can't care like I care, because caring as much as I do is an abnormality. It's not what should be.  
That level of valuing people is why I reached out first to others for so long. Because I care, and I'll always care, no matter what. But when I stop talking ... and no one is there to talk back because I didn't try anymore, that's when I realize that all I've been doing for the entirety of my adult life is ""watering dead plants,"" to use a phrase I learned when I was hospitalized. Just because I care about someone doesn't mean they care about me in the same way, and that's always been the hardest lesson that my brain has tried to wrap around in my entire life.  
I wish I had a switch that I could flip to turn my emotions completely off. I'd rather feel nothing for the rest of my life than to continue to feel everything like a wildfire all the time.  
If everyone in my life is pushing me away because I'm causing them problems and discomfort, because I'm too much in their lives, the easiest course of action is for me not to be there. Because at the end of the day, I want the world to be a happier place. And if the world is better because my pain isn't in it anymore, then at least I feel like I've done one thing right in a sea of mistakes.  
I realize now that I'm jealous of my step-dad. Because he got the escape from his pain. Even my granddad ... who passed from cancer a little over a month ago ... he battled his mental health for many, many, many years ... including at the very end, and even though it wasn't what ultimately took him from us, he too got his peace from all the anguish he'd been feeling for so many years.  
At this point, I just want peace from my own thoughts, my own feelings. I want peace from this violent roller coaster that makes me feel like I'm a helpless passenger in my own body and my own mind. I want to feel like I can truly be myself, but I know that not only is that not possible, it was never realistic in the first place. I let myself believe in ""what I wanted to be"" rather than in ""what reality is"" and that only ended up ruining my mental state even worse than what it was before I ever had any hope at all.  
Therapy, medications, friends ... things always worked for a little while, but in the end I've always fallen back into this pit somehow. I guess ""who I really am"" is broken and empty, and that's how it's always been.  
So many people have told me that I don't need to apologize for who I am, but I feel it's the opposite. I AM sorry. I'm sorry to every single one of you reading this and I'm sorry to all those who will never read this because they were already destroyed by me long ago and are probably glad that I've given up fighting. My deepest regrets will always be those I've lost because I was too blind to see my own faults in the first place. I've never forgiven myself for losing any of those relationships and I never will. That blame is my cross to bear for the rest of time.  
I've wished for months that God would just strike me down, that in a single moment it would just ... all be over. I don't understand why he hasn't already, because it's what I deserve. When someone has caused the kind of damage that I have, the kind of hurt that I have, I don't deserve to still be here. I don't know why I am. I wish I had the courage, right now, to do what I tried to do three years ago and close the book forever. Because writing more pain into the pages of the world by being myself isn't worth living anymore. That's not living anyways.  
I don't know what else to say that I haven't already said at this point. But for the few people who believed in me past the point when I could even believe in myself anymore ... y'all probably kept me going longer than I would have on my own. I hope y'all have all the happiness you deserve in the world and can live free of any more burden from me, because none of you should have ever had to stand underneath that cross with me.  
To the ones who said I deserved to disappear out of existence, y'all were right.  
And to those I love and care about, I'm sorry for loving y'all too hard. I wish I'd known a different way.  
I'm going to stop typing now. If anyone made it all the way to this point... thank you for caring in that respect. Be happy, be well, and now y'all can be free of me. That's what's best for the world.  
And please ... please don't waste any tears on me. I'm not worth the energy of being sad. I promise.

I just had to write all this out. I had to get it out so that I can break completely and let go. I'm sorry.",1713210635.0,

ToeAdministrative802,"Potentially lost my last client, feeling partly suicidal. ",2,1c4prp3,1,"Hi guys,

For context, I've been a freelance writer for a while. 

Never thought I'd get to this position, my last  long-term client, whom I work with on a basis of pitching ideas to which said client always responds and commissions, has ghosted me. No, they haven't been fired. They still work with the company. 

Now I'm feeling completely lost, my other pitches aren't getting a response, the potential clients who had reached out sometime ago all ghosted (they just fail to respond to my emails) even after doing splendid work (sample work) for them, their words. Sad to see that all the big bylines I acquired over the years have not been enough to secure me good gigs. 

I have thought of just looking for a full time job but unfortunately, I live in a third world country where so many people are unemployed, and all the people I know got their jobs through connections, despite not being so qualified. Unfortunately I don't have too many connections. 

I majored in Economics and have experience in finance and accounting but that hasn't been enough to land me a full time job in my country. 

I honestly don't know what to do at this point, switch to SMM? Technical writing? Finance and crypto writing? Or just go back to school and pursue the only courses where you are assured of a job in my country, teaching or nursing? (medicine is too pricey) Or maybe do CPA until the final level and maybe try to get a job in international firms? I honest don't know anymore. 

I have around $7k in savings but I don't know the best way to use it since it seems like everything I do fails. I'm tired and tbh I have contemplated suicide because what's the use of living if nothing seems to work out? 

I find it unfair how some people don't have to struggle in life, some people in my country don't even know what LinkedIn is yet have great jobs. Meanwhile, I have to do the most on that platform, and apply to tons of jobs everyday. 

Part time jobs don't exist in my country. I really wish I wasn't born in such a ridiculous, stupid country where things don't work.",1713196655.0,

Smolio84,I feel like I peaked in high school,1,1c4vegx,1,"I’m a 19 yo college dropout with what seems like no future. Despite how badly I wish it wasn’t true, I think the old fucks that say it are right: high school is the best time of your life. 

I hated high school. I hated waking up early to go do some random bs for 7 hours a day and then coming home to do even more work after that. I hated the condescension of every staff member towards me and I hated the helplessness of it all. 

Through my distain I found a way to make the best out of what felt like a bad situation. I was a duel sport athlete through all of high school. I played 4 years varsity hockey and 1 year varsity baseball ( 2 years JV and didn’t play junior year). I had a large social circle and felt comfortable enough to really be myself at school. 

I didn’t put too much thought into my future because honestly I didn’t want one. I have struggled with my mental health for most of my life, and I didn’t truly see a future for myself anywhere. I have passions for sure but they’re not suitable careers in my opinion. I decided I was gonna major in computer science and see what happens. 

9 months after my first day, I’m now a college dropout with just a hope of becoming an electricians apprentice. With my whole life being dominated by sports and school, I never really made time to get a job in high school. I have zero credible work experience. 

My friends are all off at college or have jobs that keep them tied up most days. I’m the only one that’s doing nothing. I’m the only one that’s a complete loser.

Even though I’m trying to get a job in case the apprenticeship falls through, it’s a bit difficult with no resume. My parents are screaming at me constantly to get a job, but somehow won’t accept a dishwashing job as real work. I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

To whoever’s out the reading this, don’t grow up too fast. Enjoy your time in high school, even though it feels like a pain in the ass. I promise you, as much as a pain in the ass sucks, it’s better than the panic attacks you get during the rest of your life.

ssqp781,Achievement Unlocked: Rubbing Alcohol!,2,1c4ph12,0,"Posted on a drunken middle of the night (20 hours ago, via rubbing alcohol in my bathroom); I did drink my parents' rubbing alcohol in their bathroom later, and I've yet to succumb to chemical poisoning. Anyways...

\---

Clearly, I have a problem.  
I had a problem when I resorted to drinking from a mini bottle of hand sanitizer at uni.  
And also when I drank a bottle of mouthwash at new years, alone at home, after being sober for exactly one month.  
And after that when I gradually consumed all of my mom's various kitchen 'extracts' at home which contain alcohol.  
I turned 27 on Friday, I still live with my parents, and I'm a massive burden financially and emotionally on my family, as well as everyone that associates with me. Therefore, I've thought to myself for a while now that if I make it to 27, I have one year until I stop being 27 to ELIMINATE MYSELF, and once I turn 28, I should certainly aim to live the rest of my life, however long that should be. But, until my 28th year comes, ALL BETS ARE OFF, essentially.  
Seemingly, I become slightly more suicidal than unusual when I'm highly intoxicated. I'm still not sure if rubbing alcohol diluted with water would ACTUALLY induce drunkness, it's been worth a shot over the course of the day.  
I don't have anymore in my bathroom, but my parents might in theirs.

Snowy8787,There’s no purpose,5,1c4izka,1,"
I have felt this way for most of my life, around maybe 4 or 5 years. I feel worthless and lonely. I am a disappointment to my parents. They have accomplished so much more when they were my age. I have accomplished nothing and it is because it’s my fault being too much of a coward to try new things. When they were my age they met each other, learnt to drive buy a car, buy a house etc. I will never admit this to them because I don’t want to seem weak which is what I am.

I’ve always wanted a girlfriend but I don’t deserve one and she wouldn’t deserve me. If I was a girl I wouldn’t date myself. How could I love another person if I can’t even love myself. I have no qualifying boyfriend skills. All I want to do is go to work go home and hide in my room. Even if I somehow overcame this I was simply not meant to meet someone special, I am tremendously ugly and short. No girl would want to be with me why would they. I still crave for a relationship despite all this even though I know I shouldn’t. I just wish I could be hugged more, yes I know I’m pathetic.

I don’t see any purpose in the future or how I could find any happiness from it. All the good times are in the past now. I will never see Nan again and my parents will never be together again. Anything that I used to find fun I don’t anymore. I don’t enjoy playing video games anymore, I am just playing them to have something to do until it is time to just go to sleep which is my best part of the day. I don’t find much enjoyment in the food I used to love. I find most of the time I just stress eat and find I’ve already just eaten something before I realised it. Even places like Burger King and McDonald’s, it just doesn’t taste the same anymore. It is a similar experience with films. When Is the next time I could watch and enjoy guardians of the galaxy at the cinema with my whole family still together, never so what’s the point on carrying on.

Primary-Newt-3483,Why can suicide be rational even if you aren't terminally ill?,5,1c4hxfo,5,"Edit: Title should read ""can't"".

Something that has always confused me is the idea that suicide is inherently bad unless you are terminally ill/in chronic pain.

However, many mental health issues are chronic with no cure available. Say a personality disorder or bipolar.

Now no-one would say that these conditions do not affect your quality of life. As someone who has experience mental pain (bipolar type II) and physical pain, I can tell you I'd take the physical pain every single day.

That's not to discount anyone's experience of physical pain or their opinion to the contrary. That's not really my point.

My point is that suicide is often considered a rational response to physical pain. Whereas for mental health issues it's always ""things will get better, think about other people etc.""

Things won't get better. They have been getting worse and worse over the last decade (late 30s). No prospects, can't afford to live alone so will have to share with strangers (which is fantastic when you have bad anxiety), addiction issues to self-medicate etc.

And think about other people? Why do people not think about those suffering? As the cheesy quote says ""if you love something, let it go"". 

I want to be able to sit down and have a rational conversation with my friends and family. No-one says you are selfish for wanting to leave a party early because you are having a terrible time. But wanting to leave this plane of existence is seen as completely selfish.

Well life is a party we all have to leave eventually. I'm just hating the party and want to go home early. Everyone else will join me at some point so what's a few years in the grand scheme of things?

I don't want my friends and family to think it's their fault, but I can't do that without having a rational conversation with them. Which the stigma of suicide for mental health issues makes impossible.

Rant over I guess. I'm just done. Sometimes it doesn't get better and that's just life. At least I have pushed my friends/family away enough to ease some of their pain when I take the plunge so to speak. I just wish it could be on my terms and not society's.

I've always known about the harsh reality of this world and the truth that things will not be ok and that we are doomed to basically be slaves the entirety of our existence after becoming adults, but still. I can't believe i am so different! 

No matter who i meet, no matter how much i try to interact with others, i just can't find anything in common with them! And in college... it's even worse! Everyone is so hardworking and smart, and i feel truly worthless, and to make it worse, i'm studying something i don't even like, and to get to college i need to travel 1 hour and 30 minutes or even 2 hours. I know this is supposed to be common, but i was so used to just... wake up and get to school and then rot in bed. Now i have to wake up at 4 am to get to a place i don't like to study at and study something i don't like or that i'm good at!

And after all that ""rant"" i think that's the word for it... I realized ""Wow, i never truly had any aspirations, hopes, dreams or anything that made me special!"" I am so painfully average, then why? Why cannot i perform simple tasks? Socialize? I guess it's just the continuous years of just rotting in bed and playing videogames are finally coming back to me.

To be honest, i don't even know where i want to get to with this post, i guess i just want to... leave my mark here?

Well, in the end, that's it. I never had any aspirations, nothing that made me special, nothing to hope for in the future. I just... look at the mirror and see a stranger? I sometimes don't even recognize myself, i am truly despicable, and an eyesore, an imbecile who cuts himself to feel... something!

Thankfully, i will put an end to it all today, i don't know what to expect from the other side. Hell? Reincarnation? Nothing? To be honest, i just want to rest, this fight is over for me. 

I wish i could have known how love felt at least once? A nice cuddly boyfriend would have been just perfect! But i guess in a country like this, my unstable psyche and unfortunate physical traits + the homophobia made such thing impossible! 

Anyways, sorry mom. You've gotten better as a person, but what you did to me back then is something my mind and body won't let me forget.

Yeah, sorry for the ""long"" poorly written and barely coherent post. It's time to figure out what's on the other side and face oblivion, i guess.",1713175148.0,

I already attempted twice. Once I hung myself, the other time I oded. It's not like I would do something soon. I'm not planning anything. 

But deep down in my mind, I have this feeling that I might end up killing myself or dying from substance abuses. I don't know. I have no energy to explain it anymore. Lately I've been crying over and over after I get back from work (which also drains me) until I forget what was the reason in the first place. Just so you know, I'm not very emotional. I was doing good. I tried to distract myself by doing new things. Drumming, painting, writing, well, many artsy things. I liked doing em. Now, everything is boring. I don't want to do anything. The only thing I want to do is completely isolating myself. And erasing my existence from everyone else.

unnamed_op2,I want to die so this confusion in my head will be finally over,2,1c4nzzh,0,"I have A LOT of problems since always. Troubled life, not only childhood, but mainly childhood, but all my life has been very messy. Lot of traumas. Lot of regrets. I'm also genetically fucked up, and this fucks up my head and bring a lot of mental issues.

What I have: Anxiety and severe depression for sure. Probably OCD. Maybe a bunch of other things as well.

So, there's this thing. There's this person. She's perfect and the best so please do not say anything bad about her. But in 2018 she said some things that were triggers for me. Since then some things have been said and happened that were like triggers scattered throughout the years. But the main ones occurred in 2018 and 2019. Those triggers are related to a main thing, which I will refer to as ""blue"" from now on.

I never ever liked blue, I was pretty sure I did not want blue in my life at all. But then with all those things related to blue being said/happening, something slightly changed in 2019, because I thought about blue in a different way but in two occasions for a few minutes only. Then, skip to 2021. I had a lot going on, living alone, fucking depressed, angry, and I was like ""you know what? I'm gonna search on the internet about blue"" Idk why, I think I wanted to hurt me emotionally but Idk why. And then BAM! I discovered a FUCKING NEW ENTIRE WORLD EXISTS, the signs, the names, the stuff...

Since then I've been reading/watching/learning about blue every time I have a free time, it's taking over control of my life. In 2021 I still was tricking my mind that I was seeing things related to blue just for a different reason, that I did not want blue in my life. I was just lying to myself. Things started to slowly change in 2022, then in 2023 it took control and I was all for blue. But sometimes I'm reluctant.

And now it is fucking ruining my life. I don't know if she really wants blue or if I misinterpreted. But why did she say all those things? fuck my life. I'm going insane.

Aftermath: I want to kms so this mess in my head will stop. This is not the only reason I'm currently suicidal, but this thing is taking. a HUGE toll on me.

People who do blue of course encourage this. But when I read normal (i.e. vanilla) people talking about this, they're disgusted. Actually even people who do blue say this may have bad results. IDK WHAT TO DO. I CRY EVERYDAY AND THINK OF BLUE ALL THE TIME. I even started to hit my hands/arms every time I have a thought like this so this can stop, but I got to the point I started to get bruises, and sometimes my hands and arms are really sore.

I really wish I could go back in time when I didn't know this was a thing.



I am not saying this is this person fault. Please do not say anything bad about her, she is perfect. But the truth is the things she said and things that happened were triggers that led me to get to know blue and all this happened.

only things keeping me going(it sounds dumb but bare with me pls) are videogames, art(sometimes but i mostly have art block), maybe sometimes watching anime to escape life..? atleast for a bit

i cant just keep doing this though.. i'll have to work for technically the rest of my life, im not looking forward to that even if i enjoy my job. its gonna be new when i first start, i'll be very motivated

but then i will lose interest.. im really not sure why this happens im abnormal

i also suffer with body dysmorphia, ocd(i know bdd is also a part of it but i wanted to list it seperately) sociak anxiety, my mood is also very unstable and i have anger issues, so i take medication.. im scared it will top working like my old ones :(

i also hit myself in the head(im trying to stop i had a headache for a week), now i hit my arms, bite them, scratch them(blood makes me dizzy, so thats a reason im not cutting)


i was always a quiet kid, i still siffer the consequences of bullying( 4 fucking years man..)
my bullies dont suffer at all!! isnt that great hahah ;-;

i got bullied for my high pitched voice, small lips(they are small both ways.. width and like idk height? they are thin), my nose(i broke it twice as a kid, parents never bothered to take me to a doctor), interests, shyness, being too quiet, having ""acne"", but its actually rosacea so im gonna suffer the rest of my life.

speaking of rosacea.. not only am i in pain from the stinging and burning feeling, i also suffer with red cheeks and i blush TOO EASILY,.. i get papules and pustules because of dairy, chocolate, coffee... and i love those... i just dont want to eat anymore

i gained weight from my meds, got to 55kg and im 155cm.. then walked a lot for like 2 months and lost weight!! im at 48.1kg now... but i overdid it and i have achilles tendonitis now
i also have hallux valgus, its genetic.. it hurts to bend my toes sometimes.

im like the first pancake. all the bad stuff /genes got distributed to me, while my little sister got everything good.

im very pale(i like this i think it suits me well) but the problem is i have black hair so my peach fuzz IS VERY VERY VISIBLE and i hate it so much

i also hate my thighs, i want to be skinny kike my sister, even if i lost weight i still feel fat.. i dont know anymore

my parents are terrible too, dad has anger issues.. mom is probably a narcissist

i remember she used to tell me no one would love me because i was walking slouched, but i just did that because i dont want to be seen by anyone

she got me new shoes cause i needed them and then she told me she never slends money on herself and wastes it on me

she also hit me sometimes, she hit me with a jacket and i yelled it hurts, she said she chose the jacket because the zipper would hurt me and i deserved it

bullying and my parents comments( also my sister sometimes) really messed with the perception of myself.. i cant see what others see, im not pretty at all.. if i do rarely find myself pretty, i think its my brain lying to me so i dont hurt myself from feeling ugly all the time,. even if i feel pretty that day, i see people stare and i think they stare cause im hideous, and if i feel ugly,.. i still think they stare because im hideous :(
i got my dream piercings(snake bites) some people give me dirty looks, like im some terrible monster, i did nothing to them though???

i dress quite differently, not that different but people still stare. ive gotten compliments from other girls(about 5 total) it made me happy for a bit but then my brain told me noooo they felt pity for you and said that to make you happy

I don’t know why I’m writing this, because I know that I’m a fucking loser and I don't deserve the right to speak. However, several websites told me to talk or speak up, but since there is no one in my life, I decided to voice it here. It seems to me that this is unlikely to help me, but I’ll try anyway.  


I want to kill myself, I wrote down why below. However, I just have no help, all the internet sites say that ""to get rid of suicidal thoughts, talk to your friends or have fun."" I have no fucking friends and there is nothing interesting in this world for me.

I have been living in Germany for several years, however I am from an poor Eastern European country. I have problems with the language (German), I have terrible grades, because the teachers simply refuse to help me, they force me to write texts without using a translator or at least a dictionary, so my texts are very terrible from a grammatical point of view and I just get terrible grades for this. I already repeated the school year because of bad grades, but because of the terrible attitude of the teachers towards me, I have to repeat another school year. I want to say that I am already several years older than my peers.  


Because of my bad language, I have absolutely no friends. (I used to have friends in my homeland, but they rejected me and we no longer communicate). The Germans just don't accept me, I'm trying to be funny, I'm trying to be interesting, I'm just trying to be a fucking normal person. However, the Germans simply do not accept me. I'm the worst student. I'm bad at absolutely everything. There is not a single thing that I am better at than anyone else. I'm bad at everything. I have the worst grades in the whole school. I get ridiculed all the time, I get bullied and people just hate me.  
P.S. Changing schools is not an option, I have already changed 4 schools in total.  


Of course, I've never had a girlfriend. I've never been on a single date and I've never celebrated Valentine's Day because I'm fucking ugly. Previously, in my homeland, I was quite active and I talked with many girls, but every time, any conversation had several endings:  
\-ignore  
\-block  
\- “Sorry, I’m no longer interested in you” / “Sorry, I found someone else”  
From every conversation, no one explained to me what I did wrong and what my problem was. Either ignore or block.  


My parents hate me. There wasn't a single day when they just calmly talked to me. Every day they shout at me, sometimes they beat me up, simply because I (for example) forgot to wash the dishes because I came in very tired. Every time I try to talk to my parents about a serious topic that is important to me, my parents reduce the conversation to the fact that I am a fucking loser.  


A few years ago, I found a purpose for myself. I wanted to move to Japan and make manga. However, this whole journey was terrible. All the people (including my parents) to whom I told my goal laughed in my face and said that I would not achieve anything and would die in poverty. And the most offensive thing is that they are fucking right. I learned to draw for several years, but my maximum was curved geometric shapes, although I drew for several hours every day. Time passes, and I still remain a fucking loser. What else do you need for manga? Write interesting stories and know Japanese. I write various stories, but not a single person in the world will read what I wrote, because no one cares. Japanese is the most fucking difficult language in the world, I'm trying to learn it, but I can't do it without a teacher. I can’t hire a teacher, because this requires money, my parents don’t give me any money at all (they will never give money for a teacher), and I can’t go to work, because if I go to work, my grades will become even worse.   


It makes no sense for me to live a life. I have absolutely no one who even cares about me. My goal is impossible for me, except for the work of a mangaka, I don’t see myself anywhere at all. I can’t fucking do anything, I’m fucking ugly, I have no motivation to live, every day is the same. I’m not mentally healthy, I need to go to a mental hospital, but my parents won’t let me go anywhere. I want to kill myself, but I'm scared because I'm a fucking loser and I cannot look into the eyes of death.  


The only good thing is that in a year I turned 18 and I’m sure this will be the last year of my life if I don’t go to another world earlier.

If you read to the end, then thank you very much. I wish you not to have the same fate as my fucking life.",1713204833.0,

A week ago I attempted suicide, which isn't unusuall for me because I've been trying since I've been 9 years old but this time I done it because my dad told me he cared about me and I didn't believe him so I thought this would be the best way to test out if he actually did. About a months ago I attempted because my friend didn't answer my message and the only thing I could think about is that she had finally had enough of me and that she hated me and was going to leave me. I don't get why I done it bcs i don't want to die but I don't want to live eathier. I just feel like such a shitty person all the time and that I don't deserve to live. I don't know what to do anymore because every time I feel my life getting better or that I'm getting better I always find a way to ruin it and I don't feel like I'll ever be happy. ",1713204633.0,

I have a child and a partner I live with, my friend group isn't extensive and I can't talk to them about my mental health because they're tough love approach sort of people and I'm very emotionally heightened. I lost my job in November and my partner lost his in January we've been applying for jobs every day but we've stopped even getting responses, not even rejections. Our finances are so bad I've resorted to shop lifting our dinners which has resulted in multiple bans from multiple places, for context I'm not a criminal, I've lived alone since I was 16 my relationship with my family is turbulent to say the least and I've had to support myself since I was a teenager I have done nothing but work since I was legally able but recently things have been hard. I've had to start selling things I love like my clothes and collectibles even bedding and furnishings just so I can make ends meet. My best friend died in December and everything's sort of been a downhill slope from there. I'm so embarrassed and angry at myself I hate myself for letting my family down and making myself look like a fool in the process. Something I've been afraid to tell anyone is that I sometimes think if I killed myself then this would all go away?

For years I’ve been trying to tell myself that shits gonna get better, but the grass is never greener on the other side. I just graduated, bought a cool car(paid 5000 cash for it), but now I only feel stuck. But good thing I’m 100k in debt and can’t find an actual job for my business degree. Then the jobs I do just get me enough to earn ends meet, feels like I can’t even save or invest unless I heavily budget everything I do. My current job is so boring and tedious; I don’t have patience for it and the entire time I just rethink my life and apply to other places. But guess what, the grass aint greener! Everywhere wants 5 years of experience, and entry level spots don’t exist. So i just gotta get anything to make money. It’s pathetic. 

I legit have nothing to look forward to in life, and don’t want to enjoy my goals at 60-70 years old. I have all of 3 friends that I met through online gaming, and 0 physical love life. I feel like I relate to nobody except my 3 homies, I wish I had their mental fortitude to just slave away at the system. 

What ever happened to the american dream? I look back and see endless opportunity back in the day, before you could work full time pushing shopping carts and own a home with a single income. Family values in this country and across the world died, I will never own anything like my grandparents or parents. In fifty years i’ll die alone with nothing to my name, that or I’ll end up killing myself speeding in my car one day.

Even though sometimes i kept having those thoughts i only did every now and then so i thought that was justa bad day, or i was tired. But lately i can't stop, i thought that as long as i didn't cross the line of self-harm everything would okay but today i did it.
I'm scared because i don't want to make my familly sad. I know they love me and they are the only reason why i tey to keep these thought in check. But i'm scared about what will happen of i keep going like this. I still feel the pain on my leg and i don't even understand why i did it but i don't hate it either?
I wsnt to go to the psychologist but i don't even know if it will help. I've already been to one years ago and i felt tense and unconfortable. I alao don't want my family looking at me with pity and worry again. I hate it, it makes me feel sick. I thought i could wait until i got a job and moved out my parent's house but 4 months later i haven't found anything and since my field most of the jobs are telematic and my parents of course told me i should stay if i get one of those and save more money.
I don't deserve their kindness. I'm a horrible person. I yern for friend but always push anyone who approach me and feel unconfortable talking to them just to cry minutes later and hate me more but then i took 5 years to cut my toxic relatiomship with my old friends. I'm stupid and dumb. I thought i was fine being alone, and i certanly like it. I like being alone but sometimes feel lonely. I don't make any sense.
I hate myself. I hate how i look, how i act, how i am, my body,my face, my voice, my hair, i can't even eat because despite being hungry my stomach shuts up the moment i think about food and gaining weight.
I rot in bed nearly all day, jumping to the computer anytime i get a linkedin notification in hopes someone would hire me already. I'm just a leech. A parasite that somehow os loved by it's host.
I want to be someone different. I dom't want to be a piece of trash and the worst of all is that this toxic thoughts are changing me. They made me cut mt toxic friends, they make me put an efforr on my appearance, they make me think before speaking. They keep fueling itself. It works so why should i stop feeling like this?
Sometimes i wish i could end it all. No more problems, no more bad thoughts, no more forcing myself to eat because my fsmily starts asking questions. My family would be sad but they probably realize that they are better without me.
But at the same time i know they love me. They don't usually tell me but they do. But i can't talk about this with them i always freeze when I try talking about this with someone. I feel their eyes judging me, looking at me realizing i'm just a leech, a nuance.
I don't now what to do. I just writed this to vent. I'll probably just try to take a nap because i'm already getting embarrased by this. I feel like i'm doing this just so strangers pity me and want to be my friends just to push them away as i always do.",1713202195.0,

I’ve dealt with depression since I was 16 (realistically started by 14 but I didn’t recognize/understand it yet) and I’m currently 23 now. I know depression isn’t something that truly goes away. You hopefully just learn to deal with it better. The worst spikes I’ve had was at 17, 18, 19, and 21. At all of those points, there were countless instances of me saying fuck it and going through with it, but I always managed to stop myself. 
After a full year of working on myself, and getting to a point where things didn’t feel numb and actually felt like what I assume people aren’t depressed feel like (aka “nOrMal”). But after all of that, boom. All hot ass. From 22-present I’ve been sad. I used to think I was so numb to even shed a tear these days. Boy, I was wrong. I cry every night now.
So, even though this thought of kms-ing has been in my head for well over 8 years now, I’m thinking I might actually do it this time. Although my thought-process/emotions are completely different this time. All the other times in the past, I felt like I was going crazy, like the 2 halves of me were in a constant fight to live or die. Each time I was on the tipping point. Yet this time, I’m just over it. And not in the sense like I’m super depressed and tired of living. Mmm I don’t know how to express this properly…it’s just different this time. Like instead of thinking “I’m tired of living (with sobbing regret and pleading for a sign).” It’s more like “I’m tired of living, not only is everything numb, but the concept as a whole just seems boring and not worth.” I’m passed the point of being tired of depression, I’m simply bored of being depressed. I’m bored of life. Again it’s different this time. Like I’ve felt empty so many times before, this isn’t that. There is something there, something to life, it’s just meaningless rather than empty. 
Perhaps it’s time to log off. If I end up, well, ending it all, I feel like my expression through it all is gonna be so nonchalant.

Classified_Darkness,"Thinking about Suicide right now, may be my last post",9,1c4c7mm,21,"I’m a 15 year old boy struggling with tons of issues. Please help me

First of all I hate myself and feel as if I’m not good enough for anyone or anything I always feel like I’m worse than everyone I know

Also I am struggling with a addiction to p*rn and it is eating away at me making me hate myself even worse

What’s really ticking me off right now is that I am incredibly lonely and want someone to love. I recently went on a school trip and got to know this girl better and they are genuinely incredible (maybe cause they are actually nice to me unlike most other people) but I just texted one of her friends asking for help getting to know her better and it turns out she’s asexual so now all hope I once had is lost and I don’t know what to do. I can’t stop thinking about her but I don’t want to travel down that path and get even more disappointed nor even if she agreed to go out with me (fat chance) I don’t want to make her uncomfortable

All in all I’m just pissed at myself and it feels like I can’t catch a brake, my entire life has sucked ass, when I was a young child my uncle who was one of the best people I ever knew was murdered because his wife’s sister was jealous, the following years everything was just all around crummy but nothing crazy and then Covid struck and my mental went to shit even being clinically diagnosed with depression, then it just kept laying down on me until I got a “girlfriend” but apparently she was never comfortable with being in a relationship so she ended up breaking up with me, after that I got rejected twice and gave up for a year or so, then my cousin had a baby but my parents failed to tell me he was even born till a week later and then blamed it on me for being in my room at the time.

Lastly I already discussed the crush asexual thing but she really gave me hope and then it all went away just like that

At first I believed I would be able to make it till my parents deaths to save them from the pain I'll cause but I'm simply not strong enough. Years ago I ran away from my job back home because I needed their love to guilt me into living (tried to find another job in the area but have been labeled an invalid due to quitting my last too fast). By the end of the month I have to move out again. Earlier in the year I thought maybe I could join the military then spend all my savings vacationing for a year to extend my life by about 5 years but I despise the bastards in the government and would rather kill them than serve them and what's the point of exploring the world to a dead man. Then I decided that over the next year I'll live in an apartment, aquire a firearm, write a will so the government can't steal my money, and die after the lease expires. In the process of applying I'm only reminded of how much of a failure I am. Proof of rental history, proof of income all things I forgot I'd need to be a real human being despite having enough savings to live in an apartment for the next 5 years if I wanted (id rather give that to my siblings than to waste it all on the dead). Only way they'll allow me to live somewhere is if I pay them the year in advance so some landlord who lobbies the local government to cut down on new housing can make thousands of dollars (on top of what they'd get by me just paying them monthly) off my small fortune all so I can prepare to die. So I think I'll just stick a knife in my throat in the next 2 weeks out of spite and hope my family and friends don't take it too hard. In the most prosperous Era of human history with me even being alive in the first place a miracle beyond reasoning and I still can't hack it. I almost hope I'll be tortured for eternity in hell for my insolence but of course I will be and experience nothing from that day forward.

TheTruthIsInsideOfUs,Life isn’t worth living in a world ruled by a status quo.,19,1c45jfd,1,"I’ve lived for 15 years, all filled with misery. I tried being male, I tried to find out more about who I want to be. I’m a closeted MtF, have Anxiety and Asperger’s, and nobody ever gives a damn. In fact, the only shit anyone has ever given me were only lies. I’ve been forced to take anti-depressants for almost 3 years just so I don’t cut my neck open.

I never had any real friends. Not online, not irl. I’ve always felt alone, I’ve been fending for myself, not even my own parents can be of help. In fact, my mom is a narcissistic fuck. If I ever told her anything about my struggles, she would literally beat me to a pulp or just burn my wrist again. My dad is not as bad, but doesn’t really worry about me much. Every time I try to find people like myself or try to make a SINGLE friend, I am pushed away. Cast out. Treated like filth. Maybe I am a monster, but hell if I know.

I have also always wanted big plans for my future. I want to go into science, engineering, astronomy, or maybe even military service. Thing is, I can’t do a damn thing for any kind of job to fend for myself in the future. Looking now, considering the medicine I’ve been forced to take for the past few years, I’d immediately be disqualified due to mental health history. I don’t think I can get a waiver either, since I’m an anxiety-ridden mess at the moment with no sign of improvement. As for college? I’m too broke to afford any. And free colleges won’t teach me jackshit. I don’t have an allowance or a way to get any money, I can’t get a job either without my parents’ approval. And as you probably guessed, they don’t care.

My fear for jobs in the future, my Asperger’s and anxiety will fuck it up as well. Sure, Americans with Disabilities Act and the Equal Opportunities Act exist, but is it really enforced? Nope. At least from what I’ve seen.

And so, here we are now, in the present. I’ve got no future ahead of me, I’m living in a prison that is my own mind, and I can’t bear to waste it all anymore. All I do nowadays is rot my brain away from staying chronically online all day, every day. I’m slowly dying inside anyway.

I’m still contemplating whether I should slit my throat to choke on my blood, cut my wrists to bleed out, overdose on medical shit I find in my house, get run over, or probably call the police on myself so they shoot me dead. Regardless of methods, I just can’t take the pain anymore. People say “it gets better,” I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT FOR ALMOST A DECADE. I don’t expect anyone to give much of a shit of what I’m posting here, I don’t care. You can say all you’d like to sway me, but I’m already dead since the moment I’ve been born. All I am now is a breathing sack of flesh and bone with no purpose. No reason to exist. There’s about over 8 billion people on this goddamned planet, so what difference does it make if I die? I’m just another voice in the crowd, a cog in the machine, a defunct tool in the box. I’m no politician, I’m no lawyer, I’m no scientist or engineer. I’m nothing, and always will be.

Thanks for not reading it all. I know you people don’t care. Nobody did, so why would anybody care now? Humanity has always been inconsiderate of itself, and it will eventually lead to its downfall.

Back story is that this girl was friends with my gf before her that passed away in 22. We became close and she was extremely supportive during the time following. I fell for her but she had fallen for me long before but because ofp trauma from losing my gf and from being used poop oh I  lolby every woman I’ve dated who would promise the world and then stab me in the back. I’m very cautious and yet for her sake I opefned up faster than I should have probably. She was attached. I was attached. She’s gone through so much this year and our relationship has kind of been a roller coaster but I truly believed we’d make it through. Saturday I got mad because when we started dating we set ground rules…like the very obvious “don’t hang out alone with members of the opposite sex” in my experience that’s where trouble starts well…she hung out with her ex husband and then told me afteghsr like it was no big deal. She said he just came to look at her car that was messing up (something I’d already done twice) and I told her I wasn’t cool with that and it went against what we’d agreed on and she just said “well. Sorry you feel that way but you don’t control me. I can do what I want”. Never said she couldn’t but it was a huge slap in my face. Then I deactivated my Facebook  because that was a source of our arguments. Thought I’d may better if she just had that privacy. But she instead actxjbvrcused me of playing games (I’m not sure to what end any of that would’ve accomplished) and blocked me from everything and said she was done. After all I’ve done for her…why this? I’ve shown her how much I love her and respect her. I she also swings back and forth in a pendulum of being rude and hateful to being sweet and loving. 

I would do anything for her. The one person who has truly loved me these last two years…now I can’t sleep because of the nightmares. I wake, scream, cry, and vomit. She saved my life and I just wanted to do that for her. But I don’t want to live without her. I can’t.

I’m a 20 black male thinking about dying tonight. I just came back from a trip a couple hours ago with some friends and was planning on drinking and smoking the rest of the alcohol and weed I have left then go joy riding on the highway and closing my eyes. I’m scared to die and scared to hurt the people around me but I feel like I have nothing to live for. I’ve been lying to my parents about going to college for the past year and don’t want to live to tell them that I’m a liar and a failure. I don’t know how they would take it if I told them I was suicidal either. In my black household anytime suicide is brought up my father calls it stupid and selfish but I honestly don’t think he knows how others are feeling. I cry maybe 4-5 days throughout the week thinking how I put myself in this situation. I also feel like my reasoning for wanting to end my life isn’t a good one and there are people suffering way more than me pushing through everyday. I just feel so lifeless and empty when I’m alone. My 21st birthday is next Monday and I have nothing planned. I’ve felt like this for the last year and a half and I didn’t think that I would be alive to see 21 honestly.

Also, nothing enjoys me anymore. It's like groundhog day, but without any end. I don't even think it's depression or anything, just a need for attention. My family is caring, my friends are kind, and everything seems that be going right. But I just feel wrong. Like I shouldn't be alive in the first place. Like the most I deserve is absolute darkness and loneliness. I know there are people who have it worse, which honestly makes it seem worse for me. Because I know I shouldn't be this way.

Taking all this into account, I've planned my suicide and should be dead within a week (probably less). One of my friends will supply me his gun when I'm ready. No, I won't be sharing my suicide note, as I find it rather personal to everyone in it.

Big_Tit_Fucker,My siblings hate each other,3,1c4fshx,0,"Hello people,

My brother is an alcoholic. My siblings are smokers (and not the cool kind). I'm down the road of trying to escape reality. We are so fine!!!! :D

Now that the internet speak is out of the way, my family has a problem. My siblings have nothing but hate for each other. And I'm the youngest have to deal with them trash talking each other. I wish that everyone would just get along (as shitty as that sounds).  My older siblings barely talk to each other and my older sibling says that I'm the one that keeps him moving forward. My brother said this to me when we were drunk a while ago so I didn't really care. Then he said it again. And again. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was about 13 and tried to commit the first time when I was 14. I don't want to live for someone. It makes me feel so fucking guilty every time that I think about hurting myself. My brother also drinks every day and I hate it even though I do the same thing. Everyday, I hope that I would drop dead. I hope that something will kill me.

TLDR: I would love to just die now but I can't because my brother says that I'm the only reason that's he's alive. :)",1713164329.0,

They purposely decreased my room temperature and laughed about it. Because i was in the room shivering. They whould walk by my room every 10 min, purposely making noises loud noises.  Then come check my blood pressure to make sure they were causing it to go up. Then laugh about it. The i heard one say that could bolus me with a lot of fluid and cause heart failure.

my attendance at school is so horrible that i almost got unenrolled 2 times. i cannot show up because im too scared, my grades were horrible until this year, its actually A miracle that i am graduating.  I even got acception into university, my dad sees this as hope that i can live a normal life, but i know ill never be normal nor will i ever come close.  im really socially inept i hide behind my dad whenever he forces me to go anywhere i cannot look at people in the eyes, i got multiple warnings when i had a job at a bakery because of my social skills being unprofessional (ecven though i displayed bad social skills at the interview and disclosed my struggle) until i eventually quit because i am so scared That it made me want to kill myself every night i got home

i take antipsychotic because i used to Typically hear voices daily telling me im worthless, to die, i know its not real but i used to ask for signs to do it and would receive them from the universe, like coloured cars and specific animals somehow would always appear, even when i did not go outside That day, at the one second id glance outside id see the sign i ask for. this is not daily anymore and only when im extremely sad now

anyway...

Ive tried to kill myself many tjmes since i Was 15 years old.  All of them have been related to some fear and i always believe the universe put me on this earth to kill myself so it gave me this mental illness, gave me the abuse by my mom (left 3 years ago) growing up, gave me the bullying, i always try to die because im terrified always, the first time i did at 15 it actually because i liked a guy for the first time, he told me i was weird and odd and that he would not like someone who acts like me. i knew then i was too different to ever fit in with the rest of them.  that was one of the rare instances i tried to get over the un-comfortability i have and try to befriend someone in person.

im about to be an adult and cant look anybody in the face, im about to be an adult and the extent of social interaction ive had exists on-line.

Basically, my friend told me she is going to kill herself on her birthday (in December). She turns 18, so she is going to get a gun, and... yeah. I don't know what to do. I don't think anything will stop her. Her life is miserable right now. She lives with an abusive mom, has depression and an eating disorder and probably other stuff  I don't know about. She already attempted 3 or 4 years ago. She has already talked to the school's councellor/therapist. The therapist called her (abusive) mom for suicidal thoughts because of mandated reporting, but obviously that did not go well. They got into an argument and her mom told her she was selfish and basically all the worst things u could tell a suicidal person. CPS has gotten involved, and they did nothing. It just made her mom more mad, which made her life miserable. Anything i can possibly think of to help her in any way seems to lead to her mom getting mad, and her life being worse than it already is. I don't know what to do, and I want to do something because I don't want to just sit and wait for my friend to kill herself.  


But at the same time, is it wrong for me to want her to stay? Her life seems so miserable right now. Is it wrong for me to take that away from her, the end to her pain? I was in a similar but way less extreme situation a few years back, so I only know a fraction of what she is feeling now. And back then, I wanted to die so bad. So, I can't even imagine how she manages to keep going. Yes, things got better for me, but I don't know if they'll get better for her. Obviously, growing up in an abusive household means that she has to carry that trauma for the rest of her life. A lifetime or more of healing.   


How do I help her, if I even should? I'm lost. I can't ask anyone else irl what to do because it'll be another mandate report back to her house. I don't want to just count down the days I have left with her, but that's all I've been doing lately.",1713147677.0,

Starting from school, I had a very difficult time at home as my parents have been very strict and loved me conditionally. Never opened up, got threatened to be kicked out if I didn't do well at school, never praised. Hence I developed self confidence issues and I never think I'm good enough. When I was trying to get into a good college, there was a time frame of two months when nothing was clear about the near future and my parents lost it. I got into a good college but life was mediocre, I had no freedom from home, was not pretty looking so didn't get attention and people weren't nice to me, couldn't discover my passions early on, did not establish an amazing name, struggled with placements, took me much longer to find the job which suited me compared to rest. Eventually, I was happy as I ended up with an okay job. The job nature was not which made me passionate hence I was preparing for post graduate exams. Post one year, I lost my job, however decided to switch to a better place. I got a very good offer and an acceptance from a ok to bad post graduate college. However the job delayed the joining and I had to join the college. I was doing very well in the college and I ended up with multiple internship offers including the best one. I was very successful and performed better than almost all my peers however didn't get the expected results in terms of not getting a full time offer. I was devastated as it was my dream. Placements shook me, nothing matched my profile and the pays were equal to my previous MBA salary hence making my MBA degree absolutely futile. Today I have used up all my earnings to pursue this MBA degree and I don't have a job. All years of my hard work since my childhood have been wasted and I've nothing left.

BackAtItAgain89,A poem about love :) ,5,1c4auhw,0,"-Pink Purgatory-  

Been described.  
Been prescribed.  
Been advised.  
Despite me, don’t despise me; Enlighten me, I still have fight in me, I don’t have spite in me, quite the opposite actually; I’ve been described one thousand times, just been prescribed those meds I liked, you have advised my paths of life, with purple lights, and other signs; so at this time, that dandelion, I made that wish when I was sixteen; *Purpose*, but now I’ve changed my mind, the wish has switched, what I really mean, and should have made more clear in that rare and sincere spout of vulnerability; don’t describe me, don’t prescribe me, don’t advise me, and of course despite me, don’t despise me: ENLIGHTEN ME and EXCITE ME.  

I love you if you’re out there.  

Along my quest of hate and jest, and without discrepancy, I wrote about my art and its self-imposed secrecy:  
…  
*“With less of dreaming into a purple storm, a raging ember rain  
With nothing to gain, with nothing to set  
Imagine I exposed these poems  
Imagine who’d I let  
Again, imagine I’d for go these poems  
Into the heartlessness of a taped cassette”*  
…  
and that’s only a passage from my 39th poem  
this poem’s my 60th, and the 8th in the *purgatory* series  
…  
***are you serious?  
years of hidden history, with no ounce of publicity?  
and this is the poem you choose to share with anyone other than me? me? me?  
with any last bit of villainous wisdom, I can’t fathom to even understand your intentions?  
if this isn’t for attention, what is your vision?  
is this the last part of many in a suicide mission?  
are you sick?  
are you twisted?  
why do you write to begin with?  
just to be bitched with?  
be serious.  
is this your comfort depression.  
where is your violence? aggression?  
do you cup your hands around your chest, imagining a strong oppression?***  
…  

I love you if you’re out there.  

And to answer your question, I write because I like it.  
If I can’t find *Her* before the unspoken date and my throne is replaced with a shiny new heir,  
these words could be my last so I might as well share.  

I love you if you’re out there.  

My trauma’s not the problem, never has been.  
Your mother is sober, in any world did you expect that to happen?  
A father figure’s out the picture, but what’s the bad outcome?  
Less havoc to trouble you, and more room for your true self?  
Sometimes the trauma’s the problem, but not enough to not be overcome.  
A past of wrong paths and hot rocks and rotten devils does not justify on any plane or any level your deep-with-resentment-and-feelings-of-helplessness, disengaged-with-the-life-you-give, present of Hell.  

I love you if you’re out there.  

My relationships are not the problem.  
You’ve ruined things with older sister and then repaired things with her, time and time again, so wrongfully calculated you’ve been, and after fully understanding both sides of the equation, I’ve come to the conclusion, being with and without family, being with and without friends, I feel the same exact with either, I can live without neither.  
Friends can’t really love you.  
Blood’s not thicker than water.  
It’s thinner than ice, as you know, and with both, at their peaks, your troubles won’t end.  

I love you if you’re out there.  

My environment is not the problem. 
With or without hygiene, with or without routine, with or without work or schedule, outside or inside, home or senselessly home-sick, nothing that’s ever, ever troubled you has ever, ever really been the problem ever, really ever, to begin with.  

I love you if you’re out there.  

My problem is love.  

I love you if you’re out there.  

My problem is love, it’s probable— No, not even probably, yes it is, I have eyes, I can see.  
Is love only a dream? Imaginary it seems,  
Is everyone else crazy? What love means,  
Why does no one I’ve ever met see love the same way as me?  
And I’m crazy?  
I keep my room tidy,  
but for who?  
I keep perfect hygiene,  
but for who?  
When I find myself taking a selfie I try and make myself cute,  
but for who?  
I’ve only just turned eighteen, it’s only been a few weeks,  
I like to write,  
I like music,  
I like art, I like weights,  
I like people,  
like or unlike me, I like the games that they play,  
but for who?  
I live and I breathe,  
but for who?  
I sleep and I dream,  
but for who?  
It’s “Live for yourself!” until it’s “You’re not alone.”  
Pick one, please, for the love of your God.  
I’ve picked one for myself, but for Who?

doctorcaylus3,I have POCD (obessive fear or being a pedo).,28,1c3xyd0,20,"It is extremely difficult to live with. Each time i thibk i could be a pedo, i think back and i come up with 10 reasons why that isnt the case.

I know im not a pedo but i still have this anxiety when im around a playground or at my little bro's school.

Its gotten to the point where i cant watch any media involving children without feeling anxious or wanting to look away, or feeling a phantom guilt after having done nothing at all.

I hate living with this condition and i really hope it gets better soon. 
I can interact with kids just fine, but there is always a bit of fear in the back of my mind each time.

My parents and my family and all my friends tell me im great around kids and i would be an awesome babysitter or daycare worker, but i just feel that being around children would drive me closer to wanting to end it.",1713113172.0,
